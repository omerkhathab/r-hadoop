"Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other ""real"" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true ""chocolatey"" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there."
"My cat loves these treats. If ever I can't find her in the house, I just pop the top and she bolts out of wherever she was hiding to come get a treat. She doesn't like crunchy treats much, so these are perfect for her. I've given her all three flavors and she seems to like them all equally. They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats. I have yet to meet a cat that doesn't just love these!"
A little less than I expected.  It tends to have a muddy taste - not what I expected since they said it was the favorite of the company.
"First there was Frosted Mini-Wheats, in original size, then there was Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size. Well, if for some reason those were too much of a mouthful, we now have Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bits. Yes, these are about half the size of the Bite Size versions. This particular one is ""Cinnamon Roll"".<br /><br />There is nothing new to the table here with the exception of size, which I is unnecessary. Personally, I like original flavor and size the best. But the Bite Size edition were accommodating. These come off as a desperate attempt to give attention to a brand that needs some sort of life put back into it and all they came up with was making them smaller and having a new flavor, which is actually too sweet for me.<br /><br />A serving size is approximately 47 biscuits. Thats 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 46 grams of carbohydrates, 6g fiber, 12g of sugar, 5g of protein and 200mg of potassium. Generally they look good but I guess those that are watching their carb intake might want to be careful.<br /><br />These probably fit on a spoon better than its predecessors in a bowl of milk, but I like the other kinds cause they snack better without the milk. But here, these small ones are easily to snack more than you should.<br /><br />I am grading this product 2 stars for 3 reasons 1) I dont think making them smaller has any reason for existing outside of Kellogs filling the shelves with more versions of something that was fine to begin with. 2) This flavor, Cinnamon Roll, is sweet and has a synthetic taste to it. 3) On the plus side, I like Mini-Wheats in general, so it saved it from being one star."
"and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.<br /><br />But seriously, I love the product. The taste was refreshing and I thought that the taste was pleasing with no aftertaste.  Not too sweet and Goldilocks would have stopped right there if there was a choice of 3.  Easy to use as you just pour the contents into a 16 oz bottle of water and shake.  Mixed well, no granulation, you really couldn't ask for anything more and Lipton like a good drug dealer knows what they are doing, give me a taste for free and have me for life.  5 stars."
"Please add more Pineapple flavor to your packages of lifesavers, in fact, can you sell pineapple flavor by itself?"
I absolutely love Yorkshire tea and am so glad it is now available on Amazon!  A cup of this full-bodied black tea with milk in the morning is how I start each day and just love it!
I have such a hard time finding loose tea locally. Being able to order my favorite Lady Grey tea on Amazon is convenient and timesaving. The tea comes in a six-pack of tins that are just the right size to insure continued freshness. Speedy shipping too!
"Previously, I've attempted a recipe with white rice noodles and overcooked them, which made them soggy. So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore."
"I make pancakes or waffles every Saturday morning with my kids, and there simply is no comparison between this product and any other baking powder I have come across. Even the more expensive brands from Trader Joe's or Whole Foods pale in comparison. Batter comes out light and fluffy every time, and my kids love them. I have also been known to eat a pancake or two. Get the pack of 6 and store up."
"I am a lover of coffee and will try almost any coffee product once. I own a coffee pod maker at work, and I have been using Senseo's medium roast and espresso pods for a few months, but after trying Marley Coffee, I do not think I can go back to Senseo. I am not demeaning Senseo's quality, but I am certainly highlighting my preference for Marley Coffee. I will admit that when it comes to pod coffee, I do not expect much, and that's probably why I have stuck to only one brand; Marley Coffee, however, went beyond my expectations. I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)). On a side note, there was no particular exotic/fruity taste to this coffee, but the overall quality met my expectations and passed the ""will continue to buy"" test. Other perks: it's organic, natural, and tasty, which, in my book, is worth the price."
In the UK this is one of the most popular chocolate bars.  It is a light honeycomb bar covered in Cadburys Milk Chocolate. If you like toffee and chocolate you will love these!
My daughter bought a Keurig coffee maker for my husband for Christmas. His favorite coffee is Starbucks House Blend so when I found that I could get the K cups I decided to get several for him for Christmas. They arrived very quickly and were just as described. He has been enjoying his coffee so it must be good.
Comparable flavor to Starbucks and cost much less. I don't know why anyone would buy a 12 pack. All flavors are good as well.
"Simply awful.  This product should be taken off the market immediately.  They did absolutely nothing for my 2-yr old dog's teeth.  I gave him about 4 per week until he almost choked to death on about the 10th one.  Awful, dangerous product, simple as that."
"I would give it.  This hot sauce is the best hot sauce that has ever been made with human hands.  To compare this to Tabasco is an utter mockery, but that is the most common ""hot sauce"" that most Americans have experienced, so that is the one that I will compare it to.  Anyone that would try to genuinely compare the two should have a CAT scan done.  A 7 out of 10 as far as hotness, Tapatio can go on anything that you need to make spicy and tasty.  Try putting a couple of squirts of this Mexican nectar in a bag of Doritos and you WILL NOT be able to put them down.  Buy the 32 oz. size, you will not regret it!"
"Luckily this is available locally so I got to try it without ordering a whole case. I find it absolutely delicious. So far it got used to make a black rice with dried cranberry dish, very simple. Tomorrow a pumpkin curry soup, then I think a chicken curry the next day. I'm looking into making my own coconut milk so I don't have to worry about using a whole can before it goes bad, but meanwhile I am delighted with this brand in both taste and consistency.<br /><br />AND let me not forget to praise the manufacturer for resisting the temptation to add those poisons people think are preservatives (particularly sodium metabisulfite). I'd rather there were no guar gum, frankly, but was unable to find any without that at local supermarkets."
"This oatmeal is great.  I eat it almost every morning.  The brands in the stores I was buying had changed the texture and I did not like them anymore.  I coould not find an oatmeal I liked so I stopped eating oatmeal..... until I found out about McCann's. The cost is the same as in the store and with free shipping from Amazon, I don't lose out at all."
Satin Ice is the best tasting fondant I can find on the market.  It's a little more sticky than other types of fondant but you can keep it from sticking to your hands by rubbing some crisco on your hands before working with the fondant.
I bought this for my 73 year old dad he had seen it on a commercial and thought it looked like good stuff..he is very pleased with it
"I never saw this gift basket myself nor tried any goodies from it. I bought it to say ""Thank you"" to my business associate.<br />The recipient liked it, so I think I will purchase it again in the future. It is priced fairly and it is a nice way to express your gratitude."
Unbeatable little tool for making shredded green papaya salad.  I use it to shred many different not-so-ripe fruits and veggies besides papaya. Better than the typical cheese grater for shredding because it doesn't bruise the fruit/veggie. I highly recommend this tool.
"It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK!"
I had a salad in a restaurant for lunch and went crazy over the  roasted raspberry chipotle vinaigrette dressing. I decided  to recreate the salad myself at home. The salad dressing I found in my search on the internet was the Fischer & Wieser  Roasted Raspberry chipotle vinaigrette dressing. It is absolutely fabulous! I have made the salad  many times and for friends and have had to order extra bottles since I got them hooked on it too. This salad dressing will not disappoint and  deserves a five star review!
I was so happy to see this deal. I recently have been using alot of pumpkin. I was so excited to see an organic product that I could actually afford! I look forward to using it in many recipies.
"Very hot, but smooth, great consistancy, for use with most Korean cusine. Just a dab will do, you don't want too much. This items is tasty, but extremely hot. Great side with most Korean dishes"
"Okay, I jumped the gun, because they were sending me the review information, before I received my chips, so I thought I would be honest, and indicate that I have not received them, and I wasn't happy about not receiving them. However overall, the service is not bad, and my chips are on the way.Sorry guys, they really are not bad people, I am just an impatient buyer... there, is that better?"
"Disappointingly, this is IMITATION Almond Extract and a terrible value.  The $0.65/oz price is also quite deceiving and misleading.  That fact that this is an imitation product was not made clear in the description.  I bought this only because I needed a filler item to reach my free shipping, but will not make that mistake again.<br /><br />Comparatively, [...] currently is selling top quality 100% Pure Almond Extract for only $6.69/4 oz.  Lesson learned... the hard way."
"I've tried several brands and flavors of ground coffee from Amazon, and this is by far the.best.coffee.I've.had. I decided to write a review because last weekend my husband made me a latte, and it was yummy. I asked for a second one, and what he gave me was not what I had the first time. I asked him what was different, and he told me he used a different brand and flavor. He was really surprised that I could tell. The one that I LOVED was the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. Wow. What a difference. It's smooth and full bodied - okay, I'm full of crap. I have no idea what ""full bodied"" is other than a fat chick. But I can tell you this -- this coffee is tasty and you will not regret buying it.<br /><br />I bought it in January because there was a deal going on - $12 for 4 bricks. But here I am willing to pay $15 for 4 bricks (S&S price) less than 2 months later. I wish I had stocked up when it was cheaper, but who knew the coffee was going to be THAT GOOD! It's so worth even $18 for 4 bricks!"
"My dog is relatively picky when it comes to treats, but she loves these. They don't do much to help her doggy breath, but maybe over time they will help."
"I bought this item for my dog to play with. She was smart and can get out all the food in it. Initially I like it since it was entertaining for my dog. However, my dog quickly chewed open the rope - only the 3 time I used it.<br /><br />I think there is a problem with the design - it will be great if the rope can be replaced with some better material so it does not get chewed immediately.<br /><br />I asked some dog friends and they pointed out the same problemm. I would not recommend this item for dogs who chew. Well, most dogs chew, so...There are many other interactive toys that you can try."
"This tea has a nice mellow taste.  It is not at all dusty and doesn't leave a bitter taste in your mouth, as is common with a lot of teas.  Will definately buy more in the future. The box is very nice and I would feel comfortable giving this as a gift."
"This is THE best red curry, don't waste your time on the cheap imitators.  Mix with cocunut milk and real palm sugar + chicken and veggies and you will amaze your friend and families.  This is great red curry paste!"
"I'd received a sample of Stash's English Breakfast Decaf with a previous order from Stash's website, and I knew it was good (for decaf tea, which is always missing something -- I think it's the caffeine.)  The price on this multipack was so good, that I could give a couple boxes away (which I did, cause I can't go through that much decaf tea in a year) and still save money over buying it in the supermarket."
"I can't think of anything bad to say about this coffee. Every guest we have had enjoys it. I'm not much of a hazelnut person, but it tastes pretty good to me."
"I ordered these when I found out the Morningstar Farms veggie dogs are no longer available.  After reading about 100 reviews, I decided to try this variety.  We have been vegetarian for 12 years, so I am used to the faux meats.  Some I like, some I don't.  I LOVED Morningstar Veggie dogs, they were my absolute favorite.  Most veggie dogs in the refrigerated section of the grocery store have a ton of onion in them!  These Veja-dogs are OK on taste, but I do not like the texture.  It is A LOT like that of a hard boiled egg white.  When I first got one out of the can I did not want to even try one.  It was squishy and had tiny dark brown spots.  The syrupy stuff they are stored in really grossed me out too.  I have eaten about 5 now and am still not crazy about them.  My son however LOVES them.  He says they are his favorite.  I will try another Worthington veggie dog (Super Links or linkettes) before giving up on the ""canned"" dogs all together.  I hate onions, but I prefer the texture of the tofu dogs found in the grocery store."
"Edit: I've given this three stars vs my previous 1 star when I was told the can was not meant to brew tea in. I still would  prefer a ""total travel solution"", then it would have been 5 stars.<br /><br />Original Post: The can to brew the tea leaks. I sent the first one back thinking maybe it was defective. The second one leaked also. And, the can gets super hot, to the point of not being able to pick it up.  I also posted this review on the Teavana website, it has not been posted....just an FYI about neg reviews sent to them."
"Lucy's Cinnamon Thins are crispy, yummy and entirely too tempting! They taste like snickerdoodles,and I can't quit eating them!"
"After a lot of research, i decided to switch my 3-yr old Doberman from Iams to Canidae and have been very impressed with the product. Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan. When you look at it like that, I believe it's one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today."
"I bought this apple butter as a change of pace from my normal peanut butter or laughing cow light cheese spread.  It is absolutely delicious and very healthy.  It's more like a jelly but I am willing to compromise given the nutritional value.  Real apple butter is higher in everything ... calories, fat, sugars, etc.  My next purchase will be a case of it!"
"My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better."
"I'm not generally a fan of hot sauces.  However, when I initially came across this in a diner I gave it a sniff, and it smelled promising.  It was quite good with my steak that morning.  Now that I have it at home, I will admit it's a touch salty, but the flavor is quite savory in comparison to your run-of-the-mill hot sauces."
"I recently bought some of this at a local market.  I decided to try it because for quite some time now I have purchased Morton's Light Salt to cut down on the some of the sodium I take in.  This Diamond Crystal blend is not only cheaper than the Morton's for a generous amount more, but it also taste better in my opinion.  Like the Morton's, it contains a full one third less sodium.  But where the Morton's uses the popular substitute Potassium Chloride that has a slight metallic taste to it, the main substitute ingredient in this Diamond Chrystal blend is Silicon Dioxide, which to me has a much more natural salt taste.  I prefer it over the potassium chloride, and as already mentioned, you get more for your money with this blend making it a sure deal. It took me no time at all to get used to it, and I use it in my cooking as well as in the shaker as well.  If you have trouble finding it locally, I suggest you pick it up by the case here on Amazon and you will be set for a year or more.  A real good salt substitute, (that does contain real salt as well) that I recommend..."
"If you're looking for a yummy treat for your cat, try these.  After trying both the chicken and salmon flavors, my cats greatly preferred the chicken.  In fact, they love them.  These treats are 100% white-meat chicken, so you'll be giving your cat a truly healthy treat instead of one that's loaded with carbs and fat.  I will definitely buy these again."
This is my favorite tea.  It has that lovely flavor and aroma of Ceylon tea.  I drink way too many cups of it each day!  I only wish they had a decaf version.
I LOVE MY FROG GUMMY CANDY...I even shared it with the grand kids (even though I DON'T normally share with anyone).
"I like this product enough that I used to buy at least a bottle a week locally - mostly to flavor my mineral water and ice tea, while adding some Vitamin C. I was scared to mail-order a 12-pack of glass bottles filled with liquid. I envisioned disaster. Not to worry. They were set in a special foam spacer insert and well-protected. They all arrived intact. The package was still easy to open. The price is really good. I would not hesitate to order again. Good job!"
"I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS. But back to the product at hand- would I order these again? Maybe, but I am more careful about each bean I pop into my mouth now. As a highly allergy sensitive individual, I can't afford to down bad beans no matter how tiny the black dots are."
I planted mine in a separate area next to my yellow and mixed color sunflowers and they never sprouted. (shrugs)  I wonder if I got an old batch of seeds.
We recommend buying the coffee pods through Amazon. They cost less than at the manufacturer's site.
"With a legendary name like Gevalia, I was disappointed to find that the coffee contains artificial flavors.  The outside packaging looks gourmet and epicurean, with gold lettering.  Unfortunately, artificial flavoring also plainly occupies the front face.<br /><br />The aroma from the coffee is quite pleasant, however, after brewing, the coffee itself is nothing to write home about.  In fact, it tasted rather bitter.<br /><br />I would not buy this item."
My bishon/shitzu puppy loves these. They don't last as long as a rawhide more like a treat. The mini size are perfect for her!
"I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!"
"These taste really great in smoothies! They add a creamy texture and a bit of a nutty flavor. What a great way to add protein to a veggie diet! Love them. They arrived fresh and packed nicely. If I ever run out of my 3 lb, I will order again from this seller."
"I bought the jumbo-size bars and love being able to help myself to one at home whenever I'm in the mood.  It's that combination of sweet caramel center and salty, crunchy peanut coating that does it for me.  The boxful arrived promptly and the contents were fresh and delicious, but since every bar is wrapped in plastic, they stay fresh too.  Really a fun buy."
"We love Crystal Light Fruit Punch.  Granted, this is a LARGE amount of punch but works great when mixed in a very large container.  Nice price."
"I have been using Nutiva coconut oil for over a year now and I love this product, the texture, the taste.. Wonderful and light and delicious ... I have tried other brands but they have a funny after taste. I substitute coconut oil for all my cooking and baking if I can.. I use half and half with butter to cut down the cholesterol but still get a buttery taste, I float a teaspoon on my hot chocolate for quick morning energy (divine) .. I pop the pop corn in my ""whirly pop"" machine... YUMMY."
I bought this online because I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores.  The packets are easy to use and I keep several in each purse so they're always at hand.  They spruce up the H2O in my water bottles and can even keep the tab at a restaurant a bit lower (if you dare !!!) lol
"I bought this because I'm a type 2 diabetic on Byetta.  I use it on my oatmeal and on fresh grapefruit.  I havent used it on anything else yet, but I plan to try it when I bake some granola.  Its very sweet with no aftertaste.  It also doesnt affect my blood sugar.  Great stuff."
"Absolutely the way to go if you're cutting refined sugar.  Low glycemic index, tastes like sugar, great for diabetics."
"I absolutely love this product and most of the flavors.  It is not sold in stores by me any longer, so was delighted to find it here.  Much better than the same type of drink sold by the other big name company's."
"I almost do not want to purchase Green and Black chocolate as I cannot stop at one piece but devour the entire bar.  ALL their chocolate has this effect on me but particularly this almond one as the almonds are whole, not pieces, and the chocolate is SO SMOOTH that it truly melts in your mouth.  I consider it health food as it has almonds, right."
"I am the family butcher who at home, salt-cures and smokes the bacons, hams and variety meats for my family and a few friends.<br />This Salt Cured Cod was bought online again, as this Cod is not on my grocer's shelf.<br /><br />A simple man's recipe;<br />Rinse 1/2 the cod, then with a sturdy knife, cut the cod into polite size pieces.<br />In a large bowl, cover the cod with water and refrigerate. Change water and turn cod twice daily, until you soak out enough salt, taste the salt level after 4th water change.<br /><br />In a large skillet, melt a stick of butter.<br />Drain a jar of roasted sweet peppers and cut into polite size pieces.<br />Add cod and peppers to the warm skillet.<br />Bring to slow simmer for 10 minutes.<br /><br />Serve with jasmine rice or a baguette type bread.<br />Leftovers reheat quite well."
My dog just smells the food and walks away. We have tried wetting the food mixing tuna fish water drained from the canned tuna.<br />Just something about the content that gives the food an smell Lexie doesn't care for.<br />Our dog is thirteen years old and is spoil to one type of dry dog food.<br />We can not recommend this product.
"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again."
This was gross. No other way to describe it. The pasta is horrible. There are so many other pasta options. Do not waste your money or taste buds on this.
"To be honest I'm not a huge Green Mountain Roasters fan, and I'm from VT so I've tried just about every flavor they've come up with at one point or another, but I love their Island Coconut, and it drives me crazy that their best flavor is only available during the summer...or at least from them. Amazon, however, seems to have it all the time, I suspect someone over there loves this flavor as much as I do. If you like coconut and coffee you have to try this one, it's like being on a tropical island."
"Good product and decent shipping. However, the price was $15.95 and I later found the same item in a local store for $6.95. What a gouge."
"My indoor cats were initially wary - but the third time I served it, they ate it with relish - and have ever since.  The outdoor cats [all volunteers, now neutered] took to it right away."
"I grew up getting jelly rings from the dept store candy counters, but they are increasingly hard to find.  I ordered these hoping they would be the same, but they are not.  These are a dark chocolate (I'm not a fan of dark chocolate), and even taste a little old or stale.  The raspberry filling is not as sweet as I expected either."
"I was definately expecting a better product from earth's best. However, these biscuits were not good at all. My son who only has 2 teeth broke these very easily. I will not be buying them again."
My sister brought me a few jars of this pasta sauce several years ago and I have been a fan every since.
"These pods do not fit in the Senseo machines. The lid will not shut with just a single pod in the holder. My husband did manage to shut the lid but then the coffee leaked out the sides of the machine because the seal couldn't properly close around the pod. Packaging says ""Fits all coffee pod brewers!"" and it is a total lie."
We use chicken bouillon in a lot of our home cooked meals.<br />Finding organic bouillon is oft times a challenge and so we were pleased to find this product.<br />It doesn't need refrigeration and mixes easily into recipes.<br />The taste is great too.<br />Just be aware; if you're transferring the powder out of it's very nice foil packet (into a glass jar for example) that you remember that it's powder.<br />Otherwise you might end up with powder all over your counter top as opposed to in the container.<br />Powder.
I bough this as a stocking stuffer gift for Christmas. Was very disappointed in how tiny the item actually was. Felt item had been overpriced once received. Also felt item's shipping cost was overpriced for an item that was so small and shipped in a small envelope.
This baby food is both convenient and healthy. it's great to not worry about what my son is eating and be able to grab this when I'm in a pinch!
This is the most tasty protein bar I have ever had. I introduced to people at work and some of them just get hooked. It is not as chalky as other and tastes like real chocolate wafer.
"My family loves this soda.  We sometimes buy it from a nearby grocery store.  HOWEVER,  I had it shipped from Amazon and it is no good.  I believe that somewhere in the process of getting to my home the Zevia Orange may be getting too hot.  It was very hot weather the first time it was shipped to me.  It really tastes weird...not like when we buy if off the shelf.  I tried again in cold weather this time and though it's not as bad, it is still no good. It has an odd bite to it that I assume comes from it getting too warm.  It alters the beverage and cooling it in the frig does not reverse it."
"I very much enjoy dark roasts.  The challenge I find is that many of them are either burnt or overly bitter from poor roasting.  This coffee does a very good job of being a strong dark roast that is full of flavor without any hint of burnt or bitter flavors.  It is very dark and oily and the small portion that did not fit in my airtight container dried out a bit and was not as strong flavored.  That took over 3 weeks though due to the volume of coffee and it was still better than other dark roasts I have tried.  I have used this for guests to eat with pies and cake over the holidays and all of them commented on its excellent flavor.  A couple who don't really like dark roast did request some cream, but still gladly had multiple cups.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who:<br /><br />1.  Likes dark roast coffee<br />2.  Doesn't know, and wants to try it<br />3.  Wants to change it up from a medium, or god forbid, a light roast.<br /><br />It is a good quality product made more so because of the cost"
"Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I'm sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan."
"I was very pleased with the price, quality and taste of this coconut.  I consume a lot of it by the spoonful and this was definitely the best value I could find."
"i have just brought one small package of Canidea from my oversea agent 2weeks ago, before my puppy only tried a french brand. First i was just mixed them together and seems ok, but then the old finished there is something weird happened to her, she started eating the stools??!! >:( yes and also vomited white yellowish foam and coughing after totally swished into this brand, even sent her to vet checking blood, taking pills and medical treat which i was thinking she might catch cold. anyway only feel lucky is vet cost much cheaper here...<br />then now she refuse to eat it or only a little if really hungry. most of time she'd rather biting a bone, glad saw the comments here, i will change it to other brand asap :)"
"Switched to Canidae from ScienceDiet after reading about dog foods on the internet.  I haven't noticed any major differences in the dogs habits or frequencies, other than her eating habits.  Before, she acted very finicky and sometimes would take all day to finish one bowl of food.  Now, she eats the whole helping in less than 30 seconds.  She really seems to like this food.  I will be sticking to this brand it looks like."
I bought these years ago at Walmart<br />and then they stopped carrying them.  I was searching the internet and found them at Amazon.  We ordered a box of each.  I like the spicy and my husband likes the orginal.  A learning process will be a sure thing until you figure out how many minutes for your microwave.  They are great and we love them.
"My son is allergic to milk and soy. We have tried hemp milk, almond milk, and rice milk.  By far this is his favorite.  We use vanilla for almost all purposes and keep some 8oz boxes of original on hand for mashed potatoes and the like."
"These used to almost never be in stock.  Inventory has improved, making them more predictable.  It is a delicious flavored coffee, not too much flavor since I normally drink my coffee black.  Quite good, give it a shot!"
These are excellent products.  I use them often for gifts.  Everyone who has gotten them has given rave reviews.
"Excellent taste, quality is great. Love that they are all natural organic and at the price, a bargain! I will definitely order these again."
"Found it at Whole Foods. It doesn't taste much like coffee but it's good in a different way, and definitely has similarities. I was expecting to have to put milk and maybe sugar in it like I do with coffee (not a fan of black, sorry) but I'm really liking it plain. Might change it up eventually, but on its own it's very good, a unique and interesting flavor. A little burnt. I like burnt."
"Flaked Fish and Shrimp most likely has the best ingredients in Fancy brand.  As another review pointed out, it's 15% more protein.  Not only that, if you look at the ingredients list, you can see ""Ocean Fish, Fish Broth, Shrimp"" at the top of the list.  The rule is that higher percentage component in the food goes first.  Having ocean fish and shrimp is great, as opposed to ""liver or meat-by-product"".  In fact, there is no meat-by-product in the list.<br /><br />Of course, it's also that my cat likes to eat this. Therefore, I subscribe to this on Amazon as my cat's regular meal."
Received the Greenies and immediately gave 1 to each of my dogs. Lola chewed hers right away and loved it. Lily hides hers and then eats it later. Nice size and good price. Both dogs enjoy Greenies.
"I ordered this teabag sampler after trying a pomegranate tea of this same brand. The item reached me very quick after ordering but, these tea bags are really a waste of money. Not at all satisfied with them. They don't have that aroma you would expect from a premium green teas. I would never buy this again."
On the good side it helps me with nighttime leg cramps.<br />On the bad side it gives me diarrhea.<br />Trying to change the amount to see if I can lessen the bad results...
"This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. It's not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I can't find better."
I love this candy and it is hard to come by this flavor.  Great price.  It is lasting me a long time and I can give away to friends and family.  The right way to enjoy chewy spree is to suck on it for 10 to 15 seconds and then chew.
"These drink are good enought that if you are buying them for health you will like them, but don't think they will be a nice treat to have, there is very little flavor in them."
"I grew up with this can around my house -my parents, like me, are coffee drinkers. Somehow it got phased out by my teens but I picked up a can at my local asian supermarket around three months ago.<br /><br />The first couple of cups of this was wonderful, dark, and flavorful. I loved the taste but got bored. Then I went back to my Columbian Coffee. Something still wasn't right. Now I use a 1:2 ratio of Cafe Du Monde to Columbian and haven't looked back. I cannot have my coffee any other way now. My local coffee shops rarely see my face these days because of this small orange can.<br /><br />Cafe Du Monde is coarsely grounded and has a darker brown color than most other coffees. It's not hard to see the difference if you mixed the two in a single can (which I did). Coffee Addicts need to get a can at least once in their life."
"I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder."
This coffee has a full bodied flavor without being overwhelming.  It's not too weak or acidic like other decafs I've tried.  I will definitely buy again.
"Great at all times of day! I munch a Kind Bar during the day for a snack or after dinner for dessert. These bars are fulfilling, hitting my sweet tooth and filling me up. A++++"
I am satisfied with this product and purchase. The item was delivered earlier than expected. The only draw back was Amazon apparently set me up on a revolving delivery account without my request or permission. Please be alert for revolving accounts.
Good taste.  Took a long time to get shipped but they were worth waiting for.  Good price as well.
"I really enjoyed this iced Cappucino, even though it was from a can. Poured over ice in a nice clear glass, it looks and tastes like the fresh brewed real deal. I had never tried this before being offered a free Vine sample, and now I'm sold."
"From our experience the Extra virgin, while very good, is slightly lacking in the flavor and fruitiness of the Sicilian also by Frantoia and available at a slightly lesser price from Amazon.  Maybe it is just us - what do others think?"
"I'm actually a diabetic; and cereal, because of it's high glucose content, is usually something I stay away from.  If I eat cereal for breakfast, even the good cereals like corn flakes or cheerios, I see a sudden spike in blood sugar and usually get tired at around 10 or 11am.  These Nature's Path Cereals, this one and the granola, are the only cereals from which I experience absolutely no negative effects.  Because of the natural ingredients, pumpkin seeds, flax, etc. this cereal does not immediately turn to sugar for the body to process.  Instead, it leaves you feeling full and energized for a long time.  They taste incredible too; seriously, I prefer this over regular raisin bran or whatever you'd compare it to.  Strongly recommend!"
"This product's ingredient profile on the Earth's Best website does not list ""Syrup Solids""; however, buyers should be aware that the formula has recently changed to now include this ingredient.  Their website has not yet been updated to reflect this (as of 7/18/2010).<br /><br />I spoke with their consumer relations department and asked them to update their website since the misinformation is misleading to consumers.  The change in ingredient profile to include syrup solids is disappointing.  I am now researching other formulas."
"We lived in Japan for 3 years and I leaned to love green tea.  Upon our return to the U.S. I started a hunt for green tea in a price range suitable for daily use - e.g. breakfast.  Stash Premium Green Tea, whether loose or in bags, is really excellent. Most other green teas taste like the lawn, this green teas is really delicious."
"Chocolate always compliments coffee.  It's the same case here.  The dark chocolate taste is obvious but not overpowering.  The coffee smells and tastes very smooth.  So, it truly is a good combination for what it is."
"What can you possibly dislike about Puddles? Koeze's puddles are by far the most amazing puddle/turtle/bear-claw candy out there. End of story!<br /><br />Puddles are a holiday tradition in my husband's family. After a few years of rationing the small jar through January, I ordered my own box.  We've now moved on to the larger jar of milk and dark... with a few random orders throughout the year ;)  The caramel is sooo soft and delicious, the nuts are perfect, and the chocolate is a nice quality. I've never met a person who disliked puddles. The price and almost exclusively online availability aren't necessarily a selling point, but those two factors may be the only thing stopping me form living on Puddles for the rest of my life or moving into the Koeze's parking lot.  If you think I'm joking than you've obviously never eaten a Puddle.<br /><br />They can be hard to find closer to Christmas; just about everyone sells out by the 15th of December. The price is fairly consistent and most sites ship from Koeze's directly.  Order early and stock up!"
I grew up eating these and introduced them to my very picky five year old.  She absolutely loves them.  We moved last year and I haven't been able to find them in a store - so when I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  I ordered them about six weeks ago (12 cans) and already need to reorder.  She ate 6 franks the first day we received them.  She asks me for them almost every day.
"I am a hardcore chocoholic. I try and keep fit by watching what I eat, limiting my carbs and exercising on the regular. But Chocolate...well, I haven't been able to slay that demon.<br /><br />Until NOW!<br /><br />Enter Tisano.<br /><br />I gained quite a bit of rebound weight gain after losing 48 lbs from my pregnancy. 160 lbs down to 112! But when I reached 112, well, I did the rebound thing. I was 112 in Dec. By 2nd week of Jan I was 133.<br /><br />How? I couldn't control my cravings.<br /><br />133 not alot. But compared to my 112, it was noticeable.<br /><br />Not to mention a HUGE jump.<br /><br />I felt like chocolate was controlling me.<br /><br />I embarked on a chocolate tea crusade. I bought every chocolate tea i came across. I know this isn't a weight loss product, but it's working that way for me!<br /><br />I was supposed to have lunch an hour ago. Guess what? Not hungry for it. I was in the mood for my yummy chocolate tea. So drinking that instead. It's great to not be controlled by hunger. Right now I feel relaxed and even a bit high! Whatever is in this tea is WONDERFUL.<br /><br />Hurry up and buy this  because I am about to buy the whole stock! Great addition to my weight loss battle or anyone elses!"
"The proportions on the back are vague, didn't ferment well. I even put it in the proof cycle in the oven to help it along. I've had better luck with other brands...."
"I got this present as a gift for my brother and he loves it! I'm happy to see that we have an entire year until any of them expire giving us plenty of time to eat the cereal. Instead of being giant chunks of rice krispie treat like I was kind of expecting, they're just little clusters of rice krispies with a bit o' marshmallow on them, not too sweet. Very delicious!"
This is a taste good product for those of us with s cholesterol problem.  It does help to a degree in reducing the problem and is valuable for people who cannot tolerate the statin medications
the bread mixes are perfect-i made every single loaf and they came better than perfect...thank you
"The perfect low carb snack with just the right amount of crunch and spice.  I really like these little meaty pieces.<br />I keep mine in the freezer and just take a package out when needed, so have never had to worry about the mold that some pple talk about.  I find they keep for a long time once opened as long as I keep them in the fridge.<br />They are just yummy"
"This is by far one of the best pastas if you like wheat and angel hair.  I've tried many others, but can't find any that compare to this one."
"It is very good tea. Better than any other i have had. Every time that i make tea with it, it tastes exceptionally good. Also for the price and flavour, it is a good value. Definately, if you want a good breakfast tea, this is most definitavely for you"
I've used this product for several months and like the different taste it gives to pancakes.  Actually a 1/2 & 1/2 mix with whole wheat flour is better than  a straight buckwheat pancake.  Only problem now is it is not carried in our local store.  Looking on-line now.
I ordered this cheese for my Mom who was on vacation in Florida. It arrived on time. This swiss cheese is huge and tasty. She has had several cocktail parties since and all loved it. I will be ordering from this company again. Well done.
"This is wonderful semi-sweet chocolate.<br /><br />I usually favor dark chocolate, and this isn't as dark as I'd usually get, but I find this really a treat.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It's not too sugary sweet, like US chocolates tend to be.<br />2. The texture is good. Some chocolates seem a bit waxy to me, and this did, just a bit, on first taste, but that sense immediately went away.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Maybe the slight waxiness, but it's so slight that it's not enough to even lower this to four stars.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this chocolate and will get it again."
"I will stick with Tazo, Republic of Tea or another premium brand for authentic bergamot flavor. I will not buy this tea again.  Some may like the flavor but I found it cloying and slightly sweet - not Earl Grey in my book."
The peach flavor of Knudsen Spritzers is one of their best (i also recommend strawberry and mango fandango).  The soda doesn't contain any added sugar or other undesirables.  While the main juice isn't peach juice (most of their spritzers are predominantly grape or apple juices) it does have enough peach juice to give it a distinct peach flavor.  Some people may find these spritzers a little too sweet.  I like to drink mine with ice or a little seltzer added.  I've tried other competing brands and find these spritzers the best all-juice sodas out there.
"I'm used to buying 12 poptarts for $2.89 in my area (Tennessee) so I thought 36 for $6.70 from Amazon was a slightly better deal with the prime free shipping. Well, it would have been if the poptarts tasted fresh and as good as they do when I buy them from the grocery store. They're not packaged in tinfoil like they are at my grocery store, they just don't taste the same. They'll do and I'll eat them, but I won't be buying them from amazon again, especially since the price has increased to $18 at this writing!"
"If you love salt & vinegar chips like I do, these are for you.  Great salty snack, high in protein, pretty filling, and without the grease of potato chips. Definitely recommend!"
This is the most Amazing Jasmine Green Tea that I have ever encountered!  You can really taste the jasmine flowers on many levels.  Sitting  and drinking this cup of tea is both a peaceful and evocative experience!  And I love that it is fair trade and organic.  Thank you to the company for developing such a Beautiful tea  :)
Pops well with air popper. Decent flavor (though may want to add a low sodium topping). Fast ship. Good value. Who could ask for anything more?
"I buy organic when possible and have been a fan of McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal for years, but saw the reviews for Country Choice here by Amazon customers and noticed it was a winner in Cooking Illustrated ratings, and I decided to try it.  I found no discerning difference in the flavor....oats are oats....but the price point on the Country Choice makes it the clear winner IMO."
This is a great product -- for my super picky family it is perfect.  One son loves the iced cookies and the other likes the plain ones -- it's great for all of us who have a variety of eaters.  My reason for one minus on the score was that the cookies arrived melted -- though it's probably my fault for ordering these in the middle 100 degree days -- keep that in mind when you are ordering.  Overall a great product and I love the snack size.  It's great that Amazon offers these items.
"I love this drink! Tastes just like Yoohoo. Sadly, I saw the price jump and figured I should just buy it at my local Whole Foods...until I realized I can't find it there anymore either!! I don't know if it's being discontinued or what happened but I hope to find it again soon (and not for almost $60 a box)."
"Our elderly terrier always liked rawhide chews but she tended to gag on them and then they were difficult to digest.  She seldom enjoyed that chewing exercise.  The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are the perfect chewable treat for her now and the byproduct is brief moments of breath freshening.  It does not take the place of eating kibble and my brushing her teeth, but she really enjoys these chews and they are just the right size for a small dog of 13 pounds.  In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.  Unlike rawhide chews, these are consumed rather quickly and don't require the strongest of teeth, so they are much better for older dogs who still like to chew.  I think they are a little pricy, so I look for special values which occasionally occur on Amazon, always much better than the price at the vet."
"I did like you probably did: read all the healthiness (gluten free, etc) and translated it to be 'tasteless yuck'. And then I opened one bar and looked at how...small it seemed and felt robbed.<br /><br />I have never been quite so happy to be wrong!<br /><br />These things are small because they are rich, dense and amazing and the taste is absolutely decadent.  This is a fantastic midafternoon snack that really feels like an indulgence!"
"I bought these caramels because I needed a treat that is individually wrapped (they stand along side Jolly Ranchers and Starbursts!)  They taste great; creamy and delicious.  If caramels run into a problem it's generally that they're too hard and chewy.  Not these caramels!  Not sure what else can be said about their actual taste.  All is as it should be.<br /><br />Each caramel is approximately 3/4"" x 3/4"" x 1/2"" and the entire 5 pound bag displaces approximately 1.5 gallons of space.<br /><br />They arrived in a rectangle flat box sealed in a plastic bag with a label that has a bar code (X0003AQ51L) and the text ""Caramel Squares 5lb"" and ""New"", though no date... This is the reason for the one star deduction as I believe nutritional info, ingredients, born on/exp date should have been provided.<br /><br />Seems a good product, a pity the seller didn't do more to stand beside it."
"This cereal not only tastes good and is good for you.  It will clean you out pretty good as well!  Tons of fiber and beleive it or not, this cereal has like 9 grams of protien per serving!!!"
I expected this assortment to be a little larger but the products in it were of good quality. The vendor had a quick shipping turn-around time.
"They taste fantastic but it seems like the paper-thin chocolate layer is so thin that the shipping process just made the cookies crumble; even the ones that were not broken up by the shipping fell apart when I took a bite. The taste is still great, rich creamy chocolate, tasty marshmallow and crunchy cookie all make for a fantastic Mallomar."
"Pops big, tastes great, but the hulls are huge! (Expensive)  I Feel like a dog with peanut butter on my tongue trying to get rid of the hulls that suction cupped to the back of my tongue.  Wanted to try mushroom popcorn, because it looks so tasty, but will stick with standard popcorn from now on."
"I think I received a bad batch( there's no expiration date).  Tried one---made me a bit queasy afterwards; like a fool I tried another( a few days later), this time w/o the mustard/mayo, and felt sick again.  These have probably been sitting on the shelf in a sweltering warehouse for quite some time, which can't be good for the mustard/mayo or the oily soy sauce pack.  That aside, they don't taste too bad actually but nowhere near as good as the other reviews would suggest.  I ordered a couple other Myojo ramen and they seemed fine, so I'm guessing it's just the luck of the draw---ordering food products from Amazon is something of a crapshoot( I've had stale popcorn delivered too)."
"After recently discovering a gluten intolerance I have been struggling to find things that I can take for lunch that actually satisfy my hunger.  I have tried other gluten free products and have been disappointed with quite a few.  These crackers were a pleasant surprise.  Many in the package were broken when they arrived, but that does not make them inedible.  I think they break so easily due to the fact that they are ""dry"" in texture.  Keep this in mind when buying and make sure to top these crackers with cheese or some other type of spread."
"These snacks are great!  The natural flavor is a lot like the Slim Jims we ate as kids.  Only these are healthier!  Great to carry in purse to keep sugar from getting low while on the run.  Also, my job has me on my feet with no breaks!  It's easy to grab one and enjoy it to keep going.  Low in fat and calories but high in protein.  Forget that mid day sugary candy bar.  Grab on of these! A no-guilt snack!"
"Received these vanilla beans very shortly after ordering but have not tried it yet. Saving it for summer guests. Planning on making a churn of fresh (right off my peach trees) peach-vanilla ice cream! Very hard to wait as the beans look great! Will provide product update when I make the ice cream!  By the way, gave it 5 stars on looks alone."
"Living in the Bay Area, I used to pick these up for lunch and snacktime from Whole Foods every single schoolday. They're nummy--taste just like chocolate and raspberries, not fake tasting, rich and savory--and my body feels better eating them than snacking on normal chocolate bars.<br />I just recently moved to a rural area inequipped of a Whole Foods/store that carries vegan treats. THANK GOD I can order them here, and you know what, they're insanely cheaper by the box than by buying them two at a time every day. I've been snacking on them for a month, and there's still half a box left! They're especially good at quelling those pre-menstrual chocolate binges, and are better for you. They taste good, you'll feel good. Enjoy!"
Absolute rip off - I was NOT sent the item as stated and pictured.  I was sent the Creme Latte; which you can purchase at your local supermarket for $6.50.<br /><br />I did not want the Maxwell House Creme Latte; I wanted the original Maxwell House Latte.<br /><br />They are now arguing via email with me; even though my order quite clearly states the product shown for sale here.<br /><br />Be warned - do not buy!
"I'm not sure if the four I purchased were from a bad batch or what, but the product had no effect on me whatsoever. I have tried the blue lotus 50:1 tablets and was very satisfied. I thought a liquid blue lotus would be absorbed better by the body, thus a better effect. It was quite the opposite. You live and you learn I guess, but I wouldnt try this product again unless it was free."
"I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to ""clean"" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own."
"My little darlings, and I use the word advisedly, absolutely love this.  And for me, their obediant gourmet container opener, this is really convenient.  I have a standing order so my precious pusses will not be without their very favorites for even one day.  Thanks Amazon!"
Both Grand-dogs love this product and the price was very good. The packages keep fresh until the dogs are here and I am ready to share.
"Love it, delicious and good source of protein is like you are eating a dessert!  very good I recommend this product to anyone who wants a protein snack!"
"These cookies are delicious! So soft and flavorful. My fave! My first time trying these cookies was a couple of weeks ago, and I will defiantly recommend."
So glad to find these. My daughter is doctoral student with heavy schedule and celiac--these are so perfect for her to grab as a high quality snack. She likes the other two flavors (vanilla and chocolate also). So wonderful that they are gluten free. Not too sweet. Glad I 'pre-ordered' as this flavor seems perpetually sold out. Amazon makes it so easy to send little treats like this to my daughter who is several states away.
"Pureed habanero peppers. Just perfect!<br /><br />This is the stuff Toluca Gourmet tried to copy, but it looks like they are already<br />finished after only a few years in business. Praise be once again to Goya Foods for<br />this fresh take on habanero chiles, and that is exactly what you get. This is not a<br />sauce filled with carrots, garlic, and other heinous stuff. And thats what makes this<br />so wonderful, its pure habanero flavor that you can use to make barbecue sauce or to<br />flavor your favorite salsas or other commercial off the shelf products.<br /><br />No kitchen should be without at least one. 5 Pods"
It is amazing!The caviar is very fresh and very delicious.I like it.I want eat this caviar every day.I want buy more.
"I can't stop eating these - so decadent <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LBGBP6"">Emily's Dark Chocolate Covered Mixed Berries</a>-affordable - what a treat"
"This selection was my own fault.  I assumed these noodles were something I was vaguely familiar with.  Wrong.  They were not to my taste, which does not say they are not good.  I am sure they are made with some specific consumer group in mind."
"I got 2 medium size puppies from a rescue place and needed something for them to keep busy.  Loved these things at first because the dogs loved them and they lasted quite a while.  But after the pups started getting bigger, they didn't last as long and even though these are cheaper than alot of bully sticks out there, it was costing me a fortune.  Also I came to realize that these things tend to give the dogs the runs so I quit buying."
"I was concerned that it wouldn't taste good unless it was mixed with yogurt the night before as so many reviewers had stated they do---I'm happy to report that I put it in a bowl, pour on some low-fat milk, and chow down-----it is delicious right away---yum yum go get you some. The only thing I would argue with is the serving size----who could eat a 1/4 cup for breakfast--not me--a cup at least--so it goes quickly. I also love that there is no ground up stuff in the bottom, from top of the bag to the last bite it's all perfect-----Thanks"
"These have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips.  Always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks. Top quality ingredients; brown rice, oat fiber, sunflower seeds etc. are what give this product the taste to start a conversation. Serve with fresh veggies and a good dip, always a crowd pleas-er!  I certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor."
"I have replaced candy bars with the Kind Bars, and they are better.  My favorite are Nut Delight.  The ones with chocolate are my least favorite."
"After ordering these for 3 years for my dog, they sent a different brand distributed by Radio Systems Corp, Made in China.  Granted, when I look at what's remaining of my last package of Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Refil Ring (as advertised), it also was made in China.  It just annoys me that they have changed their distributor/manufacturer.......and haven't changed what they advertise they are selling. I will return these and find another company to order from.  Perhaps Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide rings no longer exist and I'll have to find another favorite treat for my beloved dog.  Buyer Beware"
Last time I ate ramen was when I was a 16 yrs old and even then I didn't care for them much (but in a pinch was a quick meal). I bought a whole bunch of noodles for my nephew who is in college and seeing the prices these were going for I HAD to try them myself.  I prepared it as instructed in the packaging. Only difference is I only used half of the seasonings packet. I always found seasoning packets too salty for my taste ( I also never drink the left over broth saves both calories and sodium) . I also shredded a left over jerk chicken breast from last night. I must say it was very good. The noodles went great with it. Next time I will add some frozen mixed veggies as well. All in all I am quite surprised and pleased with these. I know I can have them on hand for the occasional meal when I am not feeling well enough to cook a full meal.
"These lollipops really are good.  Tasty and good for you.  My kids liked the flavors and the cute flavor names.  As a mother, I feel good about giving them a treat that's good for them!!  I even passed them out for Halloween."
"This is great tea for a great price.  Have made several pots don't end up with a lot of powder unlikde some of the brand names. In fact, for Englich Breakfast this is as good or better than just about anything else out there."
"With hundreds (if not thousands) of coffee brands and/or types, it's tough to choose one, especially online without tasting.  I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store. I'm pretty sure it didn't effect the quality of the brew, but it's just something that I noticed.<br /><br />Moving on to the bottom line here: the coffee tastes good, but might be too strong for some.  I'm used to good 'ole McDonald's coffee, which to me, is decent.  I like Peet's and various Sumatra blends from Coffee Bean and Starbucks, but herein lies the issue with choosing coffee: how do you know how strong a particular coffee is going to be?  A solid solution would be to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-10, 1 being weak and 10 being super-strong.  In using this guideline, I'd rate this coffee a 10 in terms of strength.  It's great early in the morning when you need a quick jolt of caffeine, but not-so-good in the afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Anyhow, this was worth a shot...I plan on ordering more Community Coffee, just a weaker blend."
I like the juice but fine I can no longer afford it as I have bought it for $1.99 in market but can no longer find it?  On line it is much more expensive?RuthPowell  were can I find it in a store  I live in North New Jersey 07078

"I just ate my first bar, and was thinking to reorder.  But I'm concerned that the Omega balance is unhealthy.  Omega-6 is 1200mg, in one bar, and Omega-3 is only a third of that... at 410mg.  (Omega-6 starts inflammation, and Omega-3 stops inflammation.)  Other than that, this bar is delicious, and is more than 91 percent organic, with all ingredients coming from California.  This bar is preferable over an afternoon bag of chips from the snack machine."
"We fell in love with Popcornopolis when we first tried it at a Blockbuster store... however the price<br />was pretty steep for the small cone that you got... so I looked it up on Amazon and lo and behold here<br />it be!  This popcorn is unreal... if you like pecans and caramel popcorn you will LOVE this. I still<br />have a hard time figuring out how they make it so good but whatever they are doing they are doing it<br />right!  It is fresh and crunchy - PERFECT for a late night snack and a cuppa decaf coffee, feels like<br />you are eating something super sinful yet it isn't too bad for ya.<br />Can't beat the price either! I sent this to my mother in law as her mothers day gift and she was super<br />thrilled - she actually hinted to us that she wanted this because we had sent them a 5 pack sampler and<br />this one was her favorite.<br />She said she hid them where noone else can find them.<br />Hope this review helps.... I am also in hopes that the chocoloate zebra will be available on Amazon too...<br />That one is amazing as well  :0)<br />PS: The cheese one is softer and kind of stale even though the flavor IS something to write home about -<br />don't get it unless you don't mind it stale-ish. Also the husks can get annoying in the cheese kind."
"I just got my PB2 in the mail today, and I was very curious as to how it would taste. I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me. I'm not sure I would eat this off of the spoon, but I will definitely use it in PB&J sandwiches, shakes and other recipes for peanut butter flavor.  I read somewhere that mixing it with Greek yogurt is very good as a protein-packed fruit dip."
"My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms. Not so sure about the soft filling, because she swallows them whole. Ditto for tartar control. It doesn't do much for that . . . maybe would be different if my cat would chew them."
"There are tons of environmentally and family friendly ways to use baking soda. We mainly use it for baking and cleaning purposes.<br /><br />This is not a bad deal, however, you should be aware that compared to purchasing it in the grocery store for about $1.40/lb, this actually costs more like $2/lb here on Amazon. However, if you compare a couple extra dollars (which I am sure pays for their ""free"" shipping to bring it right to your doorstep) to the cost of driving to the store and back, it's not that big a deal. Great product, good price. I'd recommend! :)"
"It is a raw, cold day in Michigan today, the perfect time to try the Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Beverage. My first concern was that the directions are in ml instead of oz...so there had to be a math lesson before I could make the drink. That accomplished the steamy drink smelled so delicious. I was sure it would taste as good as it smelled and never even thought about adding a sweetner. The first sip was awful....it didn't taste at all lemony like it smelled. I can't identify the taste but do know my mouth and throat felt an unpleasant,almost stinging sensation. So, I added some sugar. The second and third sip were slightly better, but the stinging sensation was still there and the aftertaste did not go away quickly. The rest of the drink went down the sink drain....it was definitely not my cup of ""tea""."
This liquid vitamin is pretty tasty. I thought it made my water taste like watered down Crystal Light. My kids also liked that it made their water turn pink and gave it a faint sweet taste.  It's not overwhelming in sweetness or vitamin in taste. I could not detect the vitamins at all. The only downside is that it requires refrigeration after opening.
"I admit that I am not a big dark chocolate fan. I first noticed that the chocolate does not have that sharp bitter taste that most dark chocolate has. Then again, it doesn't really have any taste. By the time I was done eating the chocolate bar, I kind of felt like I ate some wax. From there it did not agree with my system. It might be organic and dark chocolate, but give me a Hershey's bar any day.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series."
"I was subscribing this for more a convenience reason besides I like Earl Gray flavor and didn't run out of the stuff.  If you drink Earl Gray regulary and want to have some available, this would be a good choice."
"This is a very flavorful beef stock. It is USDA certified organic, which is nice. It can be a little more expensive than other beef broths in the same format. I have found that it is much lower in sodium than those others though, at least the ones carried at my local grocery stores.<br /><br />If you are concerned about MSG sensitivity, you should be aware of all of the possible names on labeling, and read labeling very carefully. The wikipedia page has a list of allowed USDA names for MSG. Since my family isn't MSG sensitive this isn't a concern for us.<br /><br />I recommend this broth, assuming you are not sensitive to MSG."
"Between my children and myself we eat a box of little bites every couple days.  I love the flavor and texture of this cereal and it is pretty healthy too.  For my kids this cereal is a treat, (I don't allow junk cereal in the house).  At the local grocery store it is over $3.50 a box.  I enrolled in auto ship and it is closer to $2 a box.  Be prepared though, there is a little more breakage to the product than when I buy at the grocery store but for the price I don't mind, that is the reason for the four star rating."
These are some of the best tasting protein bars I've ever had.  they're like eating a snack but they've also got a good amount of protein in there.  Power Crunch bars are my new favorite; I highly recommend you try them; I've had all of the flavors and not one of them was bad.  What's the best one to try?  If you like Peanutbutter then try that first - but I will say I usually don't like Vanilla flavored anything but even the Vanilla is very tasty and good.
"I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup."
"I purchased one variety of this product at a local gourmet grocery store (this review is for the Italian Herb mix.)  I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then."
"it's microwavable so basically it's ready-to-eat, and it's delicious. well, but dont take this one flavor for everyday. because that can make you feel sick. but sometimes when you are busy with your work, or even at school lunch, it's convinient. what i like about this product is it's packaging. the soup does not leak from it. plus, i think it's cheaper to buy online rather than offline."
Very happy with the shipping and product. Great product and price.I am now hooked on cooking with vanilla beans. Very easy to cut and scrape and use.
"I've never had Finn Crisp (any flavor) or other crispbreads before. Pretty happy with the taste of traditional crackers (I can eat a lot of them without toppings). Just starting to explore the crispbread space (after reading about it in a health magazine), hoping for a healthier snack, especially something lower in sodium. I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores. So I ended up ordering it from Amazon, for a pack of 9. I was brave enough to do that because of all the good reviews.<br /><br />As soon as the shipment arrived, I made everyone in my family try one. Thumbs down from everyone, including myself. Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good. To me, it has a faint bitter taste; to some of my family, it is tasteless. I can eat it, but certainly not something I can say I like. So spending 40+ mg of sodium per slice on this is not worth it.<br /><br />Well, I think I will go back to the cardboard taste Ryvita. At least it is sodium free, and I can buy just 1 box from a local store, not a pack through mail order. Personally, I prefer the cardboard taste to this faintly bitter taste."

"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore."
":: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages ::<br /><br />I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia. The form I most often use is the shaker jar, the blend with FOS, from this same reliable company (Wisdom Naturals).<br /><br />But I also buy their product in tablets for the convenience. I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product. I really believe AMZN's price here cannot be beat -- particularly if you're calculating in the current promo of 20% off and free shipping."
Home roasting is a neat little adventure that my wife and I got into just a few months ago. We have tried a few different coffees now and the best so far is this Peruvian High grown stuff. The quality is very good from the distributor and we are very happy having ordered from them a couple times. Try it you will like it!
"Folks,now that I have your attention:  Buy these crackers and replace all the typical crap you have lying around your house. These are known as a ""heart healthy"" and are recommended by my cardiology group. (Note: I am not a cardiologist but I slept at a Holiday Inn last nite!) These are low sugar,low fat, no trans fat,etc. As important, if you consume these instead of potato chips,cheese doodles,onion dip and salsa chips you will be replacing the bad cholesterol stuff with the good stuff and keeping your sugar intake low as well. A lot of eating is emotional and psychological based,not hunger based. Do the above mentioned swap,give it six weeks and you will be proactively ahead of the curve. I put these in my music store as well,on the front counter. customers eat about half and my employees gobble the rest of them up.""Wanna buy a banjo,here..have a handful of these while you think about it!"""
"I love Eden brand beans. Much more affordable than in the store. I haven't had any dented cans of beans or any problems. So far, so good!"
"Senseo coffee pods are our favorite because of the coffee fullness and the fact that they are real coffee in paper filter pods vs plastic pods other single serve coffee makers use.  We like the Columbian and Expresso for morning, but late in the day prefer decaf coffee and and the Senseo decaf is as full flavored and pleasing as the caffeine coffee pods.  A nice way to end the day."
"Waffle Crisp has been my favorite cereal since I was 12 or so the first time I tasted it. Now I'm 24 and I still totally live it. I can't find it sold anywhere in my area, which frustrates me, so I have purchased it here on Amazon to be delivered to my house every three months, which is already not enough. It was my first purchase from amazon and I'm not a internet buyer, so if that tells you anything..."
"Superb green tea. Organic and decaf. These bags are really filled up, so you get a lot of bang for the bag! With they came in larger boxes..."
"I have two indoor cats that have a very sedentary life.<br />One will eat everything you give her, literally everything, including green salad and Doritos. The other one will only eat cat food.<br />I feed them tonight for the first time with Royal Canin Light 40, I mixed other brand with Royal Canin. And guess what? They sorted the food and ate all the Royal Canin pieces first, leaving behind the other brand.<br />I'm so happy they liked it. But mostly I'm happy they are eating high protein food instead of fillers. It's expensive, yes, but I think it's worth it.<br />I do recommend this product."
"While it doesn't always work for five hours, this energy drink works well for me.  I've tried other energy drinks but they don't work as fast or last as long as 5 Hour Energy.<br /><br />It takes a while to get accustomed to the taste.  I probably would not drink this for the flavor alone.  Grape seems to taste the best."
"If you like dark, bold and strong coffee, you will not like Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee.  The product is packaged in convenient one cup serving packets, but it's very weak and almost tasteless.  It took at least two packets to make one half way decent cup of coffee.  Therefore, unless you like watery coffee, I would not recommend that you purchase this product."
All of Ferdies products are delicious and well worth the price. We order them all at Christmas time and are never disappointed.
"We get these through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program. They are an excellent natural snack. My son loves them, and Amazon's Subscribe and Save program makes it so easy to keep them stocked in our pantry. Happy Baby does a great job of producing high quality organic baby food at a pretty reasonable price! They are a staple in our house."
"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again."
"This stuff tastes worse that the juice from the olive jar. Oversalted, overpowering taste. To top it all off, I sliced my thumb open trying to pull the little string to get the foil off the top. It was wrapped poorly - the tab you're supposed to pull tore off. Save your $12 (including shipping) and get something else!"
I have checked many places and this product can be as much as double in price elsewhere.  It is a good organic drink and a great meal substitute.
My dog absolutely loves this food. He is about 14 years old and has been picky in his later years. This stuff he eats and eats until he is full! I am so happy I took a chance on this dog food!!
"Being diabetic, I always carry one of these little delicious, no added sugar snacks in my purse, in case I need a pick-me-up to prevent low blood sugar. Another thing in its favor is this snack is gluten-free. Ordering from Amazon is fast, and they always seem to have the food products that I need."
We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.
"This is great coffee but be warned, once you start drinking Lavazza it's hard to go back to Starbucks. We brew it as you would regular coffee and it is how we wake up at 5:30 every morning."

"I had a craving for Maccha flavor chocolate product.<br /><br />I found this product and was so exited to try it.<br />This was shipped from Japan, and I received it a week after I ordered it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />I had to say the first bite melted my heart! This is the one I was searching for!<br />It has a light green tea flavor, and not very sweet, the small packs<br />won't make me feel guilty about too much calories intake.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is shipped from Japan, so shipping is slow compared to domestic shipping."
These are the best tasting granola bars around!  My daughter and I have celiac and this is one of the few bars without wheat or malt flavoring.  Great taste and only 150 calories.  Bonus:  they are actually good for you!  They have become a staple at our house.
"My husband and I use the tea as a cold and hot drink,  When lightly sweeten and used as a cold drink for family and friends, it is love at first taste.<br /><br />Our 14 year old granddaughter loves the tea cold  and drinks it with many of her meals and snacks."
"This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is ""coffee flavored coffee"", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you're jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning."
This tea smells and tastes like Christmas! This has always been my family's favorite tea for children's (and big kid's) tea parties.
"After having pup on Taste of the Wild and Solid Gold Barking at the Moon, did some research to find another premium grain-free food but at a lower price and found this.  Excellent stuff.<br /><br />My year and a half old chihuahua has been on it for a few months now and couldn't be doing any better.  Both he and our two cats (who are on Purina but steal the Epigen, which they seem to prefer, out of the dog's bowl) seem to love it. And pellet size is just right for them all, very small.<br /><br />Just purchased a second bag and will continue purchasing this. Very happy with the product and it's price!"
"I love this cereal, but it's expensive to buy in a store IF you can find it.  Amazon has a great deal on it."
"Corn Nuts are delicious, enjoyable and addictive. However, I have TWICE broken teeth with them, including today. Do not mindlessly chomp away at these snacks. I'm not being overly zealous with my suggestion that you only eat a few at a time and let them soften in your mouth before chewing too forcefully. This is the only food that has broken a tooth and it has twice!"
"I've purchased the Farmers Organic canned Pumpkin the last few years from our coop & paid up to $32.00 per case.  I purchased the pumpkin from Amazon for $12 per case, wow was this a great deal!  We use the pumpkin to make the most wonderful pumpkin cupcakes with cream cheese icing & we also feed it to our boxers on a regular basis.<br /><br />I ordered 6 cases & they were delivered perfect, no dents at all.  Boy was I happy after reading all of the reviews of others that had a bad experience.

This is a LOT of money.  I can purchase this same thing from Dunkin Donuts store<br />for $11.99. I do not know who came up with this price but it is totally over priced.<br />The coffe is great!
"The assortment and taste is very good, but they were order and delivered in the Summer and they smell like they were in a fire.  It doesn't affect the taste, but the smoke smell is very noticeable.  Maybe they shouldn't be sent in hot weather or should be packed differently."
"First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not)."
"I was a bit skeptical as to how big the bags were, but was satiated in the end. Finding halal gummies like this in the US is not an easy task. Rest assured, they were Zabiha halal.<br /><br />As to the product: the taste of this type of candy is initially sweet due to the granulated sugar after which you begin to taste the flat-cola type of flavor. If you're craving these as bad as I was, it's worth the buy."
"When I first tried the cookie, I wasn't expecting it to be so crispy.  I didn't like it until after a few bites.  They definetly took care of my sweet tooth!  I would recommend these to any one with food allergies"
"My dogs love the Beggin' Strips, which is a special treat for them. Normally don't buy this item because of the expense, but your price was so reasonable."
"I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0"">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal."
"These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."
"These are 12.99 plus tax at petco. They work wonderfully for giving dogs pills. I like to break them in half, then mold it around a large capsule for my pug. They work better than cheese, banana, wet food or other treats."
"We use this product on a daily basis in all our recipes. It works very well<br />as replacement for regular table salt, it's great in tomato sauces and great<br />on salads. We love it."
"I recently tried the five pack Wabash ""Real theater popcorn.""  When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.<br />So?  I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more ""smelly"" issues.  Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content.  Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.<br />If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.<br />Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.<br />C'est la vie."
"and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."
"I bought this same brand at a local health food store.  For 1 oz. it cost $7.99.  So, when I bought this, at 4 oz. it made economic sense."
"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the ""zinger"" series.  I like Celestial Seasonings in general.  Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable.  Zinger really is a great description of the product.  It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match.  It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas."
"this Markers are great, they smoothly write in fondant, gum paste and even chocolate! they arrived on time and the only reason why they did not get the 5 stars is because they need to be cleaned often while working with chocolate, the tip scrapes the chocolate a bit when you write and if left without cleaning, it won't write.<br />These are great for details on cake pops, they work wonderfully on candy melts."
"Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good."
Popchip 100 calorie bags are a great snack that help me to control my portions.  I don't trust myself with the full sized bag!  These taste great and have a decent amount in the bags- there enough to satisfy me. They are not bland tasting like some baked chips.  I regularly order these and the BBQ flavor.  I have tried many other Popchip flavors (in the big bags) and these are my personal favorites! I don't know how them make them taste so great for so little calories- but thanks Popchips!
"When agave first came on the scene I thought it sounded great.  But after a lot more research I don't think it's the wonder sweetener that many people think it is.  It is VERY high in (processed) fructose, not the same as fructose found in natural fruit.  Fructose is metabolized directly by the liver, which is different from other sugars, and can lead to fatty liver deposits. High fructose intake has also been linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease risk in animal studies.<br /><br />Also, at the Amazon price this is extremely expensive.  My favorite is a 2 oz. bottle of NuNaturals No Alcohol Liquid Stevia--it mixes instantly in beverages, is not bitter, and lasts forever."
"These marvelous cookies remind me of ones that my Mother used to make.  I could never duplicate them, even with her recipe and directions.  She called them ""Moravian"" cookies.  I hope they will continue to be available.  The only problem was that some were broken when they arrived."
Have enjoyed many cups of this flavorful tea which was first given to me by a friend.  I have continued to order it on a regular basis.
"It may do everything the company claims this product will do, but I just couldn't get past the flavor. With ""a few drops"", it tastes like watered down Kool-Aid. If you go ahead and put in more to give it more flavor, it just tastes like really strong kool-aid - cherry flavor, that is. If you like Kool-Aid, maybe this product is right for you. If you are like me and gave up Kool-Aid many years ago, you probably won't like this either."
"My first Bigelow tea was Plantation Mint. I absolutely love it and it was the tea that got the rest of my family drinking less soda and more tea. Green tea has many benefits, everybody pretty much knows this, but I always found them to be too bland, or grassy, or overflavored with other things - until I tried Bigelow's Green Tea with Lemon. It is perfect. Fresh, crisp, quenching. I prefer tea iced with a little splenda added, and this one and Plantation Mint are so delicious. I'm a convert. I can't imagine ever drinking another brand, and I've tried several."
"My mom's friend gave this to me after I tried hers and loved it.  I absolutely love this coffee!  The flavor and roast are incredible!  I just can't say enough about how much I like it... I just hope I can get it year-round!  It is on the pricier side, but I like to save mine for a treat, and not for every day, just to make it last longer.  I love it with the coffee mate sugar free hazelnut creamer."
"My title says it all. Plus, the price per cup has not been equaled anywhere that I've checked."
"This is my new favorite herbal tea. It has awesome flavor. By adding a couple drops of stevia sweetener, this makes a great ""treat"" to sooth my sweet-tooth without negatively impacting a diet."
"Although this product arrived quickly and well-packaged, it was not the best tasting marzipan that I have ever had.  To be fair, however, it was not the worst I've had either.  My main complaint is that there was little almond flavor to the pieces, which is, of course, the reason you buy marzipan!  But if you want marzipan at a very reasonable price and are not too picky about the taste, this product will suffice."
"I have small dogs (8 and 10 lbs), so these are perfect! I use these in conjunction with the small biodegradable bin liners that I keep in a small garbage can in the back yard so all of this ""organic matter"" can decompose properly. I really HATE the idea of wrapping up dog poop in plastic that will decompose long after I do!"
"MY DOGS LOVE THEM, HOWEVER TENDENCY IS TO GIVE TOO MANY, AS THEY BEG FOR THEM.  THEY RECOMMEND 2 PER DAY AND I FIND THAT HARD TO STICK TO."
This has little flavor but great crunch so you mix with other cereals to give a big nutritional/fiber boost. we have 2 gluten-free family members and this is a great way to get fiber.
"I got this and wanted to try it out and the price was right!  Wow - the taste is sub-par and does taste like something you would find at a gas station dispenser!<br /><br />When I was reading the nutrition facts I noticed that it had 80 calories per serving (not a big deal), I then scanned down and saw that it has 23% of your daily saturated fat!!  Wow!  When I read through the ingredient list the first ones are: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, and then instant coffee and some others.  I'm not health nut both those things don't sound that healthy to me and I can see where the saturated fat is coming from!"
"Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!"
"I originally bought a couple of these from babies-R-us for my 16month old daughter to have as a snack when we went to sea world. I figured it was healthy and something she can hold onto and feed herself, since ya know at this age they are getting oh so independent and want to do everything for themselves!! She loves them! We now buy them by the case from amazon because buying them individually from babies-r-us is just a little expensive, and here you get a pack of 12 for $17! Being a first time mom I have tried and failed with a lot of things for her snacks so now I actually taste everything that I give her and hey even I would eat these as a snack!!"
"This candy was shipped from Diabetic Friendly and was advertised as sugar free. I bought this for my diabetic uncle as a present, and it ended up having tons of sugar. Ridiculous."
"This drink is refreshing, but a little too sweet for me. I found that others in my household enjoyed it more than I did, so it might be more fair to give it a four star."
"oredered some, the ones i got were past date and stale, some packages were open. so not gonna buy food from here again"
"I pondered buying this product for days because of mixed reviews, many concerning the size of the ginger. I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this."
"The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true."
"You know, it's been a while since I've had a nutritional shake or protein drink.  When I took a fitness course in college I tried a whole bunch of different kinds... which all tasted like chalk to me. I would hold my breath and try not to gag or throw up. So because of that awful experience, I vowed to never again drink nutritional shakes.  Then Amazon came along and offered a free sample to review. I still was reluctant but decided to face my fear. Plus, I really need to get back into shape again :) The fact that it was called a ""shake"" and not a ""protein drink"" made me more hopeful. So, when I finally took my first swig of it today I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, it actually tastes good... not to be confused with ""bearable"". It actually tastes like a nice strawberry smoothy.<br /><br />Now, I don't know exactly how good it is for you... since it tastes so good. So I can't comment on it's actual ""nutritional value"".  Oh, by the way, I drank the strawberry flavored one. So I don't know how good the other flavors are yet. One last thing to keep in mind is that it does contain Milk protein.. so if you're lactose intolerant, you may want to drink something else.  It also means you have to refrigerate it after opening.  I hope this review was helpful... bottoms up! :)"
"The crunch, the savorriness , the lovely no time this month expiration dte. I love these chips, theyre the only chips I eat without  feeling like i over ate. The package came on time and with all that i payed for."
"This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface."
"I know organic has a different taste, but this is bad. Couldn't get even one cup down. I won't buy again."
"Just received my first shipment of 12 of these. Felt kind of guilty ordering so many and spending $12 just on gummies, but that was the only option and the packages are not very large so they probably won't even last long until they are all eaten.<br /><br />These are soft liquid filled gummi candies made of gummi, foam and a juicy liquid filling. They are actually made by Haribo in Germany and contain no artificial colors. The flavors are orange, raspberry and mango. The raspberry ones are THE BEST and unfortunately there seem to be less of those in every package than of the other flavors - highly recommended nevertheless!<br /><br />P.S.: My kids like them too."
"1 1/2 years ago I quit smoking, which I assume was the right thing to do.  However, I soon became hooked on Sour Life Saver Gummies.  Now I have a new addiction to overcome.  These are awesome, why don't they make them Sugar Free"
"Toby the Catboy loves these. The price is so much more reasonable than buying them in the supermarket.  He has learned to come when I call even if there is no treat to be had.  So, cats can be trained.  Go figure."
"I have been chewing this gum for about six months, and in my opinion, it is the best sugar-free gum I have ever found.  The flavor does disipate a little, but the chewing keeps going, and going, and going...  Most gums nowadays, just don't have the chewability that gums used to have, but Mentos gum beats all others hand down - it has an excellent *rebound* and can last all morning, or even longer if you don't mind parking your gum during your lunch hour - LOL!!  My favorite flavors are the<br />Watermelon and the Red Berry."
"This gum arrived fresh, well packed, and ready to chew.  Much better price than the local retailer and I won't run out for a long while.  Nom nom nom"
"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food."
"Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order."
Anyone who has a child that refuses veggies should try this! It's a great combo of fruit and veggies- and so easy to feed to older babies- my daughter feeds herself and NO mess! It's great for on the go. Love them!
"Even though the item says ""Pack of 6,"" I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust what's on Amazon now???"
"I agree with some other comments about the Tiger in that it is not as strong as you might think, like a Midgnight Magic from Timothy's or Green Mountain. Having tried many of the dark & bold blends, however, I think it is one of the nicest all-around flavors. It's got a nice, deep, complex flavor without the bitterness you find in many of the espresso blends.<br /><br />Black Tiger is always one that I order because I can drink it regularly without the harshness. It's always in the shopping cart!"
"The cocoa-coated truffles were delicious, but I had the impression they would be a bit softer than they were. Their centers were hard dark chocolate.  Not sure why I was expecting a product different from what I received, but they were delicious regardless.  And there were so many in the one-pound gift box!"
"I recently came across this very delicous soda at a supermarket. It is really refreshing, and is wonderful with a little shot of Hendricks cucumber infused gin.  However, this price is ridiculous, and you should be ashamed of yourself for selling it at this crazy high price. I can get it at my market for $1 a bottle!!"
"These are great.  Lots of (undoubtedly artificial) cherry flavor, and not doughy like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8J2HO"">Twizzlers Cherry Nibs</a>. Just perfect!"
"I have always been quite a picky eater, and at times have trouble upholding myself to a certain eating schedule, which results in me not eating enough. While trying to change this around, I started to think of possibilities that I could use in order to assure I sustain myself in a healthy way. This lead me to searching amazon for suitable snacks that are somewhat healthy, and provide enough calories to get you going for a little while. Erin's Baker's breakfast cookies is the result of this search. With a good 300 calories, these cookies provides you with a good balance of calories and the needed nutrients (especially coming from the whole grains) while at the same time being a pleasurable eating experience. I have not tasted anything other than the double chocolate chunk, however I can safely say these did not disappoint. I have been ordering them for a few months now, and have now signed up for the monthly subscription option.<br /><br />These are highly recommended as snacks, especially for the mornings where you couldn't help but stay in your nice warm bed a little bit longer, and do not have enough time to make a proper breakfast before having to head out for work or class."
"My hair is thin, and most shampoos leave my hair feeling dry and stringy. The Clear Scalp Ultra Shea shampoo really cleans without drying my hair out. After rinsing my hair, it no longer feels dry and stringy. I use it in combination with the Ultra Shea conditioner, and my hair feels really good. My wife uses both the shampoo and conditioner and also likes them. My one complaint is that it does not rinse off easily. I have to rinse a lot to get it out of my hair, and my hair is short. While I don't like to use the same shampoo very often, this is one that I will use a lot. My wife and I both love how it smells, too. Try it, I think you'll like it."
"i bought one of these bottles because i wanted to try it out first before i got alot of them. i tryed half a bottle since i didnt want to be all hiped up. the taste was horrible..it was like drinking gross medicine. i didnt feel it right away, but i did notice after my walk to my daughters doctor (about 30mins) when i was in the waiting room and i sat down i was pretty tired and could of fell asleep. it was no more than 2 hours of me takingit. im sure if i took the whole bottle i would of gotten more energy. i may buy a few more of these bottles in different flavors. it did help me with early morning appointments that i know i wouldnt of wanted to do( no one likes sitting in  and running back in forth to 3 different offices all day)<br />besides the taste i think its alright"
"This is going to be a staple in my house from now on- good flavor, less jitters, makes a great 'anytime' coffee. Decaf can be so uninspiring.<br /><br />I wish they would make flavored half caf....are you listening, Green Mountain.."
"I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good."
"I first had these when a Chinese co-worker brought some in...  First taste: Think perfume-scented Jell-o.  Odd, fragrant, unsure.  Second taste:  A little better, but still unsure.  Third taste: Hooked!  They are an acquired taste, but I crave them all the time.  Two jellies are the perfect pick-me-up anytime during the day.  I can't really eat more at a time and fewer somehow falls short.  I finally found some in an Asian market in Florida for way cheaper than here... bummed at the price.  Still, you can't go wrong with these!  My wife hates 'em."
The Xylitol quality is great and made the perfect cookie.<br />It substitute regular sugar 1:1 and gives you the great benefits of not abusing sugar.<br />Use with confidence.
Just got it in today an the first thing i noticed is the box cover is 3-d.<br />Has Beetlejuice with a shrinkin head and when you turn it. It has barbra and her husdand on each side of beetejuice with the husband head in beetlejuice's head. It has the soundtrack and the cartoons. So all in all you getting a great movie. Song songs and the cartoon.<br />Worth every dollar
I tried Millstone Coffee about 5 years ago and I've been hooked every since. The best coffee that I've ever had.
"My cats loved the treats and gobbled them up right away.  They really enjoyed the treat, I had to hide them or one of my cats would  bat them down to the floor, and try to get into them."
"I am so pleased with this purchase.  I had bought 2 ounces of Med. shredded coconut from Whole Foods and paid a much higher price.  This coconut is not as sweet as the one from whole foods but is just as delicious and so much less expensive.  I have made the recipe on the side of the package for chocolate macaroon cookies, simple and delicious.  i use Stevia powder instead of white sugar that is calls for and they are delicious if not better.  better for you for sure.  i also made chocolate macarooms with dried cherries, again delicious.  i also eat this shredded coconut by itself, great snack, low is carbs and good for you.  love love it!  and for this price you get 4 packs of it!  each 24oz.  if you do the math in what i paid for at whole foods for 2 ounces 3.99, you will figure how much you save.  store it in the frig. for longer life.  if you do not use that much, give it away as a gift."
"These are quite good. I wasn't too sure about them at first, but the more I ate them the more I liked them."
"I'm so happy to have found a high quality wet food for my miniature dachshund. Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long."
Would buy these again. Great quality and freshness. Not too salty or oily and they are about as jumbo as you can get.
"Buy it now, please. These are just great, with perfect flavor and texture. I keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing. Try them with different things: in salads, with crudite, with good dark chocolate, with your tea in the morning, as we do. A+++"
"I grew up in Southern Indiana and drank Big Red almost everday as a teen.  I have moved to New York and still enjoy the great taste.  All my friends says it tastes like bubble gum, but, I think it has the greatest taste ever.  Fred"
"I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful."
The product is what I needed. Works out fine receiving it one a month for the dogs. It is also great to order an extra shipment when needed.
I have heard this form of ginseng is best for guys but I love htis stuff too. I drink one bottle when I am feeling tired and it gives me sustained energy and no jitters plus when i take it regualry i have noticed it helps my stress levels.
"I have discovered that this product has things in it that can make my dog sick!!  I feed my dog to keep her healthy, was NOT prepared to kill her as I feed her.  She is on meds and a Healthy Pet food now.  I think the company that sells this product should MAKE SURE they are selling a ""Healthy Product"".<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for the opportunity to ""Inform"" other pet owners of this situation."
"Sure you could put it in milk and eat it like cereal, sprinkle it as a topping on ice cream or fro-yo, but it is perfect enough to snack right out of the bag.  I love how sweet it is.  I am not a fan of dry-barely-sweet granola but the gooey sugary stuff marketed toward children isn't great either (I'd rather eat a cookie or cake).  This hits that midpoint that is perfect when craving a sweet snack (without going for a full-fledged dessert).  The chocolate is perfect and sweet without being bitter like found in many healthier snacks.<br /><br />Nice perk... the zipper closure at the top.  I can never seem to find a ""Chip Clip"" in my house when I need one though I have bought dozens."
"Our family eats at Taco Bell on the rare occasion, and I've never been a big fan of their food.  Their sauces on the other hand, I've always liked.  And not only is it cheaper and better quality ingredients to make your own tacos for your family, but now you can have the awesome sauces, too.  I really like this one quite a bit.  It's got a little bit of a kick to it, and it's my husband's favorite.<br /><br />A little bit does go along way, and I cannot imagine anyone using the ""serving size"" of 2 tablespoons!  A teaspoon per taco is MORE than enough.  And I like it that way, that you get plenty of value out of the bottle.  Will definitely buy again, and will buy other flavors as well."
"I am surprised by the negative reviews here.  I mean, instant cider (the kind you get in the packets) will never taste like real cider.  This is actually better than the brands of instant cider I have found.  Yes, it is sweet, and the caramel ""finish"" is a nice addition.  This is the only K-Cup product I have found that is sugar free, which I appreciate.  If you enjoy instant cider, I wouldn't hesitate."
good to the last drop. my wife drink it all in about 1-1/2 weeks(pack of 2) thats 48 k-cups. i guess it was good.<br />i guess i will get more.
"I feel like straight coconut water is an acquired taste, but these peach mango ones are just delicious. They aren't too sweet and the mix of peach and mango is more of an accent than a dominant set of flavors. The result is a cool, refreshing beverage in what i consider to be the perfect container size. Where i live, these are priced individually at an average of $1.79, which would be around $21.50 for a twelve pack. So, for the current subscribe & save price of $17.65, you are saving around $4 here on Amazon (if you would have purchased twelve anyway that is).<br />Great taste, competitive price. I am glad to have found these here."
I remember these from when I was a kid. I have looked for them before. Hope you keep making them
"Before drinking SAMU, I would have never thought of buying coconut water. SAMU is so refreshing that it has made me a believer!"
"Yummy!  These cookies are delicious, even more favorable they are organic and organic being sold at a decent price!  Enjoy!"
"Since Joy, our Bischon Frise, started eating this food, her fur is no longer oily.  She smells much better.<br /><br />The pieces are very small and easy for her to eat."
"This is a terrific seasoning for all kinds of meat. I may even try it on fish. I have used it with beef burritos, chicken enchiladas, tacos, etc. Everytime I use it, my family and friends love it and ask for ""my"" recipe."
"We bought this for our 5 month old lab to keep her from inhaling her dinner in 5 seconds flat. We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on. Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- ""Rope"" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it. These were the kinds that we impossible to clean as well.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product. So does Roxxee, our dog, who still finds eating to be a fun activity."
I was anticipating this product would arrive 3 weeks from date of order and it came in almost a week after I placed the order.  Greatly appreciated!
It came in a timely fashion & it was a good price for the quantity I received. This tea is good for occasional constipation or to help your body along when it feels irregular.
"Personally, of all of the teas I have tried, I think YOGI is just the best...if you want an intense ginger flavor, this is the tea for you.  This is just one of  many products I have purchased from Amazon...I am always beyond pleased with the product, service and price...THANK YOU!!!"
I have two Pot Bellied Pigs and they just love these treats. And I don't worry about giving them these snacks because they are so low in fat. You have no idea how fast pigs gain weight!
"Tasted great and was much less expensive that purchasing at my local grocery store.  We put it in the crock pot overnight, and have fresh, hot oatmeal in the morning.  Yum!"
"As a newly adopter of a one year old, I tried certain foods with not much success.  My dog loves this food, and I do too, as she eats well and healthy."
We were very pleased with this product and the short time in which we received it.
"Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company."
"I just had this soup as a quick lunch and it was incredible! I was actually quite surprised - not by the excellent quality, but by the bold and intense flavors. It is spicy, creamy, and savory. And it is an excellent source of nutrition. The caloric and fat content is a good healthy type of fat coming from coconut milk, which has many health benefits. If you don't like sweet potatoes, spicy red chile's, creamy coconut milk, and a hint of lime - this soup is not for you and I would suggest sticking to the more fake quality other brands tend to offer (with 5 times the sodium and less flavor)."
"I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats."
"This is a wonderful product, we all love these at work, which is why I bought the 2 lb bag. But somewhere along the way it got overheated and all melted together in a big ball. Ruined the chocolate and ended up throwing it away. I guess don't order in the summer or come up with another shipping solution."
"I developed a real craving for some caviar a few weeks ago, after not having had any for a couple of years. I searched though Google, eBay, and Amazon till I found this product. It actually reminded me of a similar brand I used to buy in a Gourmet Giant Supermarket. While searching I was reminded that caviar ranges dramatically in price from thousands of dollars to less than ten for a few ounces. A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more. By wife also enjoyed this treat and complained when I emptied one of the containers before she had her ""fair share."" I would buy this product from this vendor again, but I also plan to compare it with what others have to offer. I would be curious to hear what others have to say about where to get low cost high quality black caviar. Thanks!"
I have purchased and used 3 boxes of the Hazelnut cappuccino and look forward to a cup or two each day!  Wonderful flavor and reasonable in price.
"I found this product living in Florida and I can say that it brings out the flavor in chicken tremendously! I have not fully marinated with it. I usually rub down my chicken and then pop in the oven at 400 and bake for an hour. It comes out so juicy and flavorful that I can not even go back to cooking chicken any other way.<br />I have yet to use it on other meats, but with the chicken I can say...do not hesitate to give it a try! Beyond AWESOME!!!!"
"This is a fine product.  Tastes great, and is organic.  However the cans are very difficult to open, and often require the use of a tool because the pop-top breaks off.  Guessing this is due to inferior quality aluminum."
"This Chex mix is one of my favorites.  It has a great mixture of sugar caramel coated cereal, popcorn, peanuts, pretzels, and of course candy coated chocolate bits. Only down side is I can't stop eating it once I start!"
This is delicious!  It is good on its own or in hot chocolate.  We even used it to make chocolate peppermint martinis!  I love this stuff and cannot wait for the holidays to get more!
"My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it."
"[...] I took it out of the box rinsed the package kneaded as directed and ate it straight out of the package.  It was so good I will definitely continue to order and probably try the other flavors as well.  Almond butter is a much healthier than Peanut Butter especially this brand and another brand I ate which only contain a few ingredients.  FYI for those who like Peanut Butter Justin's brands are just as healthy as their Almond Butters.  I wanted to try the squeeze packs because the other brand I have eaten in the past though good, it's such a pain to have to stir this huge jar of it every time and I like to keep an eye on my calories so having to measure out a serving from a jar each time gets messy plus it's so bland I always add a little honey to it.  This was was perfect not bland like plain Almond Butter, but not too sweet or salty just enough of everything.  Besides the convenience of not having to stir and measure from a jar I like knowing exactly how much I am getting plus these can be thrown in my purse when I go out for a quick healthy snack when I am out.  Being Gluten, Corn, Soy & Diary Free (among a few other things) makes its difficult when out so it's nice to be able to have something with me that I know is healthy and I am allowed to have."
"I had been searching far and wide for canned pumpkin, but to no avail until I came across this product.  Until finding it on Amazon, I had never heard of this brand before.  After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but I love pumpkin, so I placed my order.<br /><br />The items came in less than a week (I ordered right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend).  Every can but one (which had the slightest dent) was in excellent condition.  The cans were packed in a cardboard tray, shrink wrapped and then bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.<br /><br />The taste is just right to me -- pumpkin, not too light or too strong.  The consistency is not too thin or too thick, but again, just right. The quality is comparable to (if not better than) its brand name competitor.  The product is organic pumpkin, period.<br /><br />My compliments and gratitude to Farmer's Market Foods. This was my first experience with this product, but I assure you, it will not be my last!"
"If you think that salt is merely salt, listen up! This salt gives a flavor to food that you<br />would have never imagined. Salt is a flavor enhancer, but this salt tastes like the Rolls<br />Royce of them all. If you want to savor your cooking and kick it up a notch or two, I recommend<br />sprinkling this salt on just about anything you can put in your mouth. BRAVO!"
"I'm amazed at the negative reviews here as Timothy's Kaluha has become one of our favorite K-Cups.  Both my wife and I drink our coffee with cream though, so maybe if you were just to drink it black you'd experience something different?  The only beef I have with K-cups (and this is in general, not just the Kaluha) is that they brew a much smaller cup than I'd like.  I almost always have to have at least two cups."
"I was excited to try this out but disappointed to see that it was about to expire less than a month of receiving it. This is not the first product I've had problems with expiration dates through Amazon. It's been anywhere from Taco Seasoning to Dog Food. I understand that this is organic, but I received this in June and it expired this month. I also understand that it is a problem with Amazon, but since this is an Amazon review, I'm bringing it up.<br /><br />I did try it, and I have to say after trying the food, I was super disappointed that my baby wasn't going to be able to because I thought it was pretty good myself. I was honestly surprised that it wasn't bitter or gross. I loved the packing of this product but wonder if we aren't paying more because of it. The price to me seems a bit on the high side. I will say that Amazon does have the cheapest price at $23.38 (if you subscribe & save) but I see other organic food for less."
"This is an excellent ketchup!  It is great on nearly anything, from eggs to roast beef.  Use some in a spaghetti for a little kick and wonderful on a meatloaf!  I am going to buy more and buy some for family for Christmas."
Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
"I'm really glad we got the big variety sampler because it gave us a chance to try many flavors. And they were delivered by Amazon, right to our house, so that made it really easy. Especially since you can't find that much interesting to choose from at the store. I wouldn't say I disliked any of them. Some I loved or liked better than others but they were all pretty good and it was fun to have the choice options. I would go with buying the sampler again, just because I have had so much fun sampling them so far. The blueberry...sounds weird, but it's not too bad. I love all the donought and cinnamon roll flavored ones. Mmmmm."
"This tea is vacuum packed for freshness (a foil bag inside the tin), as all sencha should be. The taste is pure, green, and luscious. [...] I would give this 5 stars, but when I bought this it was 12 dollars and now it's 14."
I didn't read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. I tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. I'll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini-splurge. I'd like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.
"I just received a Kuerig coffee maker for Christmas and had already tried this brand in a friend's machine.  It is a good, strong cup of coffee.  K-cups functioned perfectly."
These gummy snacks are wonderful! They are in nice big bags. My kids loved these and I loved them as well. Full of wonderful fruity flavor and very chewy! The only problem--we couldn't stop eating them! : )
"If you like good bold coffee to get you moving, look no further.  A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead."
"Since moving to the Northwest, we wanted gifts for friends and families that reflect our new lifestyle.  The trio of smoked salmon is perfect.  I keep some around for visitors also.  It doesn't have to be refrigerated, the salmon is very good, and the 3 pack makes it great for a couple of visitors or open more than one box for a crowd.  Put out some cream cheese, crackers and the fish and you are the best hostess in town.  Be sure to pat the fish with paper towels before serving or it is very wet."
"If you are a fan of miracle noodles, you will love this added alternative to standard noodles out there.  You cannot beat the amount of fiber you're getting without a ton of calories!!"
"This food is organic, sure.  However, look at the ingredients, top 7 includes chicken meal.  Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product.  It's a cheap substitute, and really is bad for the dog.  I suggest a brand like Evo, Blue Buffalo, ect.  No ingredient should be meal or by product."
"Yes, these are healthy, but please do yourself a favor and at least buy the ones that are salted.  These are dry and taste like what I would think dry leaves and acorns would...I'm just not bold enough to actually eat that.  Even better, get the salted edamame 12 pack.  theyre just as if not more healthy, just as cheap, and taste hella better than freaking soy nuts"
I like it... its my everyday snack and being cheaper on amazon makes it easier for me to order and have it one a day.
This is a great tasting product for 100calories and you actually get quite a few chips in the bag. Salt and vinegar are my favorites. The plain taste like Munchos. Will definitely buy again!
"This matcha is amazing. There's a slight grassy vegetal flavor from the matcha, but it's really mostly amaretto without the alcohol burn and without all the sugar. Absolutely fabulous. If you like amaretto, you've got to try this!  All the deliciousness of amaretto without any of the negative effects from alcohol.  Think of all the ways you can use this!"
"Nothing compares to these cat treats.  They are real chicken, and cats absolutely love them.  The jar seems expensive, but it will last a long time.  These are definitely worth it for the cats in your life who give you so much unconditional love!"
"Here is my review; I have tried many Jerkys and am always looking for new ones that could be my new favorite flavor. The Red Hot Lime and Chile isn't one of them. However, their Jim Beam Glazed Beef Strips are to die for. Go figure."
"I purchased this oil as I was thrilled that a local grocer actually carried it.  It was a 20.00 bottle.  What a waste of money.  There is so little truffle flavor that you end up using way more than what is normal.  Now, someone who hasn't been in the kitchen for too long might think that this is ""wonderful"" but no..Don't buy..End of story"
"Canned cat food is much healthier than dry. Grain free cat food is much healthier than one with grains. My cat hates food with ""chunks"" so this nice smooth pate suits her fine. Great food!"
"This is some of the best coffee of any kind that I've had in years. I don't write a lot of reviews, but had to give these folks credit for an excellent product. I like very strong coffee and San Francisco Bay French Roast delivers - rich flavor, delightful aroma... yes, due to the unique pod design (which works perfectly with my Keurig brewer) you have to store them in an airtight manner, but it's totally worth it. The only improvement I'd suggest is making their shipping bags - which have a valve like on a regular bag of coffee - zip-top, so I can use them without a rubber band after opening. But I expect that my have price implications, and I prefer the lower price over a better bag."
"Great coffee, organic, shade grown, fair trade, and delicious--at an unbelievable price. It's a LOT of coffee so I just freeze the extra. Bye bye starbucks--hello to homemade."
"I like many flavors of Tic Tacs, but these are especially good.  There are two colors in the pack, both with a different type of strawberry flavor.  The darker pink is more of a true strawberry while the light pink has a subtle mint flavor at first, followed by a subtle strawberry.  I loved them both!"
"Delicious and very effective.<br /><br />One of the competitors pushed one of these bars into my hand during my first figure competition last summer and I was blown away by the incredible, not your typical protein bar, taste of this product. I love them.<br /><br />Fitness buffs and non-fit folks should earnestly give the Power Crunch bar a try.....you'll feel the same way!"
OMG these raisins are the best chocolate covered raisins EVER. I loved other brands until I tried these. I can never eat another chocolate covered raisin unless it is an Emily's chocolate covered raisin!!!!
I purchased these for some friends before I found out that all the low end coffee is responsible for rainforest destruction. I only buy shade grown fair trade organic now.<br />Hope you choose to do the same.
"It is very moist, which is what I like. You can really taste the spices too, which I love.  It is very good for a gluten-free product."
"This was the packaged baby food I gave to my son, and it is his favorite.  It may be a little tart, but it is cute to see his reaction each time I put a spoonful in his mouth.  I like that this is organic and has DHA in it.  I have gotten several other flavors for my son, but this seems to be his favorite."
I ORDERED THE WRONG THING AND I CANNOT RETURN I WAS VERY UPSET I NEVER OPENED ANY OF THE BOXES
"We stumbled on this in a nutrition website and how couldn't live without it.  All the tastiness of peanutbutter and -0- [as in nada, zilch, none] fat.  Mixed 1/1 with water and stirred up, it acts & serves like regular peanutbutter.  The taste is super, texture just right, and for those midnight moments when a little smackerel of something comes to mind, PB2 is free of sin entirely."
"This is a great product. Don't expect sweet sugar coconut tasting water. Expect something completely different. Totally revitalizes your body, especially living in the midwest this summer.  Every other time we reach for something to drink in this non stop 100 + degree weather in OK, we are getting one of these out of the fridge. In fact, I am online right now to increase my shipment number. Excellent product."
I have been waiting a long time for a diet soda that has no bad aftertaste and no artificial sweeteners.I found it with the Zevia brand of no calorie sodas . The black cherry soda is one of my favorites and tastes like regular soda. It is cherry licious!!!
"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again."
The flavor of what pops is good but only half the corn pops. I know its not my poper because Started using the oil and salt from these packages and different seeds.
"My husband is particular about his coffee.  This has a good flavor and he loves it.  It's definitely not traditional coffee though.  This is instant and is like the cappuccino you get out of the machines at gas station rest-stops.  As long as you're not expecting real coffee, it's great!"
"Once upon a time, I used cheap rice for dishes.  Over time, I have discovered that there are preferable products.  This Jasmati long grain American jasmine rice exemplifies. It is one of a series of rices produced  by Rice Select.<br /><br />It has a nice texture and a nice taste once you prepare it.  When I make my recipe for fried rice from my copy of ""Joy of Cooking,"" this is my most often used selection of rice.  The end result is tasty!  As I pour my stir fry over the fried rice, a delicious meal (well, normally) results. But a good rice base is necessary for a successful stir fry.  That combination of vegetables, sauce, some sort of meat (normally chicken), and fried rice does the trick!<br /><br />I also use this rice when I use my slow cooker.  It is useful to have some sort of base to absorb the excess liquid from the slow cooking process.  Rice does the job very well--and this is one of the rices that I depend on when doling out the crock pot dish into the serving dish for my family.  Yummy!<br /><br />All in all, then, this is a useful product for those who enjoy using rice in their cooking adventures!"
Simply excellent! Great tasting and works. I have been using this for months with success. I highly recommend this product.
"It's probably my bad that I didn't see 'sugar' listed as one of the ingredients. I'm happy that this product is BPA free which I don't see many rice cereal explicitly saying that. If people want to feed sugar to their kids they can add separately, I just don't understand why they add sugar to this baby food. I haven't returned it yet but I will. I end up making my own rice cereal which I found how-to on the web. If anyone is interested, you can go to [...]"
"Quick delivery. Effective protective packaging.  If allowed to ripen at their own pace (the product packaging tells you how), they are to die for.  You know what I like to munch on along with savoring the avocado in its skin?  Baby carrots!  Soft then crunchy.  Both good for the digestion."
"I love all these different flavors that they have come out with for Blue Diamond almonds.  Soooo Goood.  While this one wasn't as good as the Wasabi flavor, it was still delicious."
"This tea tastes pretty good. As a tea lover I think it could be a little stronger, as it doesn't have a very strong flavor (though I do use my cups twice to fill a small pitcher). It is sweetened with sugar (18g per k-cup, I think) and stevia. I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners but I'd much rather it be stevia than another toxic chemical sweetener. There is no foreign after taste, which makes it more agreeable. If you like sweet iced tea and you are willing to use stevia, I recommend this product."
I ordered this product expecting it to to look like the picture shown.  When I received the antler it was about 4inches long and extremely thin (in width).  I have bought antlers for my puppy in the past who is an aggressive chewer and they have lasted for months.  This one is almost gone and it has only been a few days!  Definitely not worth the price and not as pictured!
this is really good for what it is and fairly cheap too. i liked is so much im buying more!!does not settle like the cocoa
"I love this tea and drink it all the time. The taste is very nice and I do not even have to sweeten it or use lemon, as it has an almost sweet taste all it's own. I take alot of medicine and have much trouble with my bowels. When I drink 2 cups of your Senna tea I am opened up within 2 hours.<br />Thank you very much, I would not use that much laxative.<br /><br />Pat Kamadulski"
Recently the products I have gotten are not the same quality they once were.... the filter pads used to be stamped with a senseo water mark ... now they are not I think they are counterfeit - yes I am serious
"We have a new puppy who has to take antibiotics twice a day for kennel cough.  The puppy hates the pills and it took a lot of time and stress to get him to take them.  I did an internet search and found out about pill pockets.  I didn't buy from Amazon because I needed them right away, I paid $13 at Petco.  They are a lifesaver, we have the beef flavor and he eats it right up.  He loves them.<br /><br />Since the antibiotics will use up almost the whole bag I'm putting in an order through Amazon for more pill pockets to keep on hand."
By far the tastiest GF pretzels I've tried.  I even have to hide them from my non-celiac family members so that they don't eat them all!
I love these !<br /> I always crave salty/ crunchy snacks.. and I want to eat them without expanding. These are great.. they fix the craving without costing me a lot of calories. In the stores by me I can only get the original flavor. I can't wait to try the rest of them!
The flowers were beautiful and lasted for about 2 weeks. The individual water tubes really work for keeping them alive in shipping. Very happy with this purchase.
A family tradition is Sour Cream Chocolate Cake Cookies. My brother's birthday is the first of December and the bake-a-thon begins to fill his birthday wishes and ends with goodie bags full as Christmas gifts. This year Choco-Bake was not available in any of our local grocery stores and I was panicked. Making the famed cookies with substitutions has failed in the past....this product is essential to our successful family Christmas!  I was THRILLED to find Amazon had Choco-Bake so I ordered 12 boxes. Thank you Amazon!
"I've been using this popcorn for years and it's the best on the market. No artificial butter but the real deal and if you want butter, you can melt your own. I recommend this especially if you're using a whirey Pop Stovetop popper."
Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!
"MY BOY LOVED THEM..HE KEPT ON COMING BACK FOR MORE..I JUST WISH THEY HAD THEM IN A LARGER SIZE. MY PET IS A BIG GERMAN SHEPHARD, AND THESE ARE LIKE TINY FOR HIM, THAT HE GOES THRU THE BAG WITHIN 3-4 DAYS...HE LOVED THEM....THANK YOU...."
"Eden black beans are delicious and healthful.  Eden foods beans are the best on the market because they contain no salt (add your own to taste) and they also contain kombu for digestion.  They have no off flavors or smells. (I find canned beans often have strange smells - but not these)<br /><br />These black beans are whole and are great for making hispanic dishes using whole beans. In a hurry, I eat them just out of the can, no heating or preparation required - though perhaps this is not for everyone!  They are also great for making your own refried beans, chili, southwestern salad, or other black bean dishes.<br /><br />These beans are the next best thing to cooking your own - maybe even better, since there's no work involved!"
"I came across this soda entirely by accident when I went out with some friends to a Peruvian restaurant. They didn't have much to offer for beverages and even though I normally don't drink soda I decided to give this Peruvian favorite a try. I liked it! It reminded me of cream soda with a hint of lime and very carbonated. I can't beleive that I ordered a six pack off of Amazon but I wanted to introduce it to some family members. Instead, when it arrived I stashed it away and lovingly and selfishly enjoyed each can until it was gone!"
"If you can imagine regular oatmeal to be hamburger, then you can imagine McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal to be fillet mignion! Yes, THAT'S how good it is!<br /><br />Chewy, flavorful, nutritious -- you just know you are doing something good for yourself with every spoonfull.<br /><br />Eat it plain, or doctor it up any way you wish: dried fruit, maple syrup, brown sugar, walnuts, diced apples, peanut butter, etc. Guaranteed that breakfast will be your favorite meal of the day."
It is sinfully delicious and a nice way to end the day. But wait...I drink it all day! Yum!
"I ordered these by mistake, thinking I got the Sesame Rice Thins, and was surprised of my error when they arrived.  I kept them, thinking that they looked healthy enough and would make a great ""different"" cracker to serve, even though they had a wheat ingredient.  I liked them.  However, NO ONE IN MY FAMILY would eat them when I put them out, and said they tasted like cardboard.  I have a full case now, which will be ""my crackers only"" for probably the next two years--unless I find another ""health"" nut that will join me in eating them!  I should have returned them before opening the first item in the case!  I learned my lesson, and will double and triple check that I am ordering the right product before pushing the order button again."
"These are the best blueberries I have ever eaten.  They are better than the ""fresh"" things you get in the grocery store.  They are full, slightly chewy, and taste like high quality berries.  The price is excellent ($5.00/lb), and delivery is fast.  I am very happy with my ten-pound stash of wonderful/healthful blueberries.  Yum!"
"I do like Sobe Lifewater.  If you aren't a fan, then new flavors probably won't matter to you.<br /><br />I am not sure how long this one has been out, but do know that it is fairly new.<br />We finally found it in a grocery store here, and Hubby grabbed a couple of them.<br />I am SO glad that he did!<br /><br />This one is very tasty!  I am one of those who also has to smell everything before eating<br />or drinking it, and this one smells good too.  Then add the great eye-pleasing color on the<br />bottle, and well, it's a new favorite flavor.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the flavor. Obviously, they have kiwi and cherimoya, which is a spiny<br />fruit with a creamy white inside. It tastes very fresh and fruity, with a slight pear aftertaste.<br />I definitely recommend this one - pretty AND tasty!"
"I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought ""When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds"" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too."
Smells so good I could almost eat it myself. Needless to say my babies love it.
"Not being a fan of chewy caramel, I was pleasantly surprised with this combination of hard and soft candy.  I got to enjoy the crunchiness of a hard candy and the mellow sweetness of Werther's Original.<br />-Samples provided by BzzAgent"
"My dachshund is a mile long and he was having serious (literally life-threatening) plumbing problems. What went in the front wasn't coming out the back, and he was obviously in pain. My vet suggested pumpkin puree, an all natural product, but it  was nowhere in the grocery stores! I turned to Amazon, my reliable source for so many things... and there it was. I like this product although it took a few days for my dog to accept the new taste (but he's finicky). Now he eats it with no fuss. I have to give him a lot more than the recommended dose, about two heaping teaspoons per feeding, and I make sure he poops every morning at the same time and at night at the same time. I also cut back on his dog food in general, which is good quality, and I make sure he gets exercise. Now he is regular and all is good! I credit Nummy for saving my dog's life. Thanks Nummy-makers!!"
"I bought these for a cute celebration of St. Patrick's Day for my Team Members.  I was trying to decide between the little boxes and these and chose the cup over the box because of the convenience of just adding milk to the cup.  Though the idea was still cute, each cup had very smudged artwork and the cups all had black ash on the outside of them while sealed in the General Mills box.  It was so bad, I almost thought they might be counterfeit.  The cereal seemed to taste the way it should, but since I bought these for their branding and aesthetics too, I was disappointed. Next time I'll get the small boxes instead."
Super easy to use and makes just the right amount of popcorn for two of us. Price is right and delivery was fast. (Got here before the popcorn machine....;o)
"The Elderflower Cordial is a lovely way to enhance the flavor of hot tea, iced tea, as well as using it by itself in hot or cold water to make a pure Elderflower tea.  I sent some as a gift, and the recipients have raved about it."
This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.
"I was looking for ways to add more beans (and more specifically protein with less carbs) to my diet when I found this pasta. I love it. It has the same taste and texture of any full or multi-grain organic pasta, but with only 16g of carbs compared to DeBoles with 46g/serving. That was a no-brainer for me. I'm not a huge pasta fan, but at least if I am going to have spaghetti this makes much more sense than regular pasta. :)"
"This yummy candy, which is hard to find in our area, was delivered super-fast -- much to the delight of my child (and my inner child)."
I have owned a Keurig for about 2 years now and this is by far the tastiest cup of coffee I've had and I've tried LOTS. I love the little paper filter as opposed to the full plastic jacket of most K-cups. It's a keeper!
"This green tea is delicious. My new diet calls for green tea or coffee only. I am not a coffee drinker and usually drink ice tea. This green tea is perfect hot or cold! I use Stevia and it taste perfect. With the cooler months upon us, this will make a great hot drink to sip on...not to mention the benefits of green tea! Buy it...you won't be disappointed!"
"This is one of the best jasmine white teas I've tasted, and I drink a lot of tea. I've been drinking this particular jasmine for about two years now, and even if I drink it every day, I never get tired of it. Just lovely."
What a perfect combination - pretzles and peanut butter.  It is one of the best tasting snacks I have eaten for a long time.  I like the size of the bag also.  Crunchy and salty.  I could not find anything about product that I did not like or want to change.  It is a top notch treat!
"I agree that the flavor has changed and it does have a more um... plastic-y taste now but I still think it tastes good (although I have always liked artificial flavors...I know that's kind of weird).  Anyway I liked the previous formula better, but I thought I should share my honest opinion that the new flavor is not that bad."
"Has a better, creamier flavor than the Safeway Lucerne and Albertsons store brands.<br /><br />The Saco doesn't dissolve quite as quickly as those two, but it does fully dissolve if you wait a few minutes or make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge overnight as the instructions suggest. One reviewer said it wouldn't dissolve ""even in boiling water"", but boiling water cooks the proteins and makes them lumpy, same as if you boil regular milk, and once that's happened, it'll never dissolve.<br /><br />With Super Saver free shipping, the Amazon price is currently only a little less than Safeway, but the milk is slighly better, and I can get a larger quantity from Amazon than the few little boxes the local Safeway keeps stocked on its powdered milk shelf at any one time.<br /><br />The box in which Amazon shipped my 2-box order would, I think, have held exactly 3 of the Saco boxes."
If you love HP sauce (you probably wouldn't be looking at buying it in bulk unless you do) this is definitely the way to go.  It tastes as good as it ever did and seems to keep without deteriorating at all (in a cool place but not necessarily refrigerated).  My family loves it on many savory items (anything from breakfast eggs to burgers and steak) and we add it to bean dishes and homemade barbeque sauce too.<br /><br />Unreservedly 5 stars!<br /><br />Just wish we could buy Lea and Perrins Worchestershire sauce and Marmite in bulk too...
"I always enjoy how a flavored coffee or tea smells.  I've usually found that the taste is never as good as the smell.  In the case of Lipton Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, this has been my experience.  The bag is an eye-catching design that entices because of the texture of the tea and infusions.  The smell is amazing!  I would make this into an air freshener in a heartbeat!  The flavor wasn't bad, but it was overpoweringly blackberry.  I couldn't even taste the vanilla.<br /><br />This would be an outstanding blackberry tea, but this product doesn't live up to the description on the carton."
"This is the best protein shake out there, not only is it affordable but it tastes great. This is a great for work when i dont have time to eat lunch this will keep me full for hours. I would recommend this shake to anyone, and i love drinking this after a workout. You will not be disappointed."
"These are exceptional. I had them first at a friend's home. Her hummus was wonderful, and I asked her for her recipe. It really is the beans that make the difference. Thanks so much for your great product!!!"
I have combination skin. The green tea & aloe moisturizer leaves my skin supple and hydrated but not oily. The subtle and clean scent is refreshing.<br /><br />I also tried the jasmine and vitamin E moisturizer. It is much richer and it's a bit too rich for my skin. The fragrance is also stronger. I'll stick with green tea & aloe.
"I don't like starchy, salty, and thick soups (too much starch actually makes me hungry). This particular variety (roasted chicken and vegetable) fits the bill. It is sparse on the noodle, with only 4 g of sugar per can (I have never eaten half a can of soup, so, all values are for the entire can). While still high, the sodium for the can is 920 mg: much less then in a ""regular"" soup.  The satisfying taste belies the 140 calories and only 2 g of fat! The liquid is light, but there is lots to chew on in the bowl: many chunks of meat and firm veggies make this a meal, rather then a snack. The ring on top of the can makes it easy to open. You can tuck a can in your purse and take it along to the office for a quick lunch. So far, so good.<br /><br />The only downside is the price. Even though I ordered the soup thru the Subscribe and Save programme, I paid for the dozen more then $6 over the price in the local mass retailer. It is not worth it, even with the covenience of free shipping. I will continue to buy the soup, just not on-line. Make sure to do your price research, but eaither way do give this variety a try. I'm sure you will not be dissapointed!"
Great Japanese Green Tea. I love it. Stay green color most of the time and test nature sweet green tea.
"Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds (which give you omega-3 fatty acids) are absolutely delicious! There're good for you, too; we all need flax and grains in our diet and so this is a preferable snack compared to small candy treats or even those tiny cake treats that have way too much sugar and empty carbs.<br /><br />My package came tightly closed and the product was fresh; that helped it to taste really good!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product; it is a healthy snack and it's great for people on the go."
good price & fast delivery. i have gout so this stuff works great for me.
"I purchased these for my 19 lb beagle.  They actually came in a holiday box (I didn't know this until I opened my amazon box), which would've been great had I been giving them as a gift.  They are the perfect size for my dog, and she devours them!  Note:  It is recommended that you give your dog only one treat per day."
"With the possible exception of their Fire Roasted Chipotle Salsa (I can't really taste a significant difference), this is the best salsa out there, in my opinion.  There are plenty that are less-costly and that alone may guide one's choice in another direction... but if cost is no object, this is the real deal."
I wasn`t sure about this instant type k-cups but it was a pleasant surprise I will be ordering more and my husband enjoyed it also
"This item was brought up in a forum with a link to Amazon. I've dealt with Amazon before and I've never been let down, Thank you Amazon for the great deals and excellant service! Anyway, this seed is tasty and nutrient packed. I've since read that hemp seed is some of the best food we can give ourselves."
"I like to brew myself a single cup of coffee every once in a while. I have the Melitta filters and a plastic cone holder. I place both on top of a coffee cup and pour in the hot water. This method works well once. If you plan to have a second cup of coffee, add a touch more coffee grounds, and run through another round of water, it will not work well. The flow is blocked and slow. Even if you move around the grounds with a spoon, the drip is too slow to warrant a second use.<br /><br />So these are good once. If you want to save on waste and cut down on your garbage creation, pick another method.<br /><br />I visited their website and couldn't find any information on their annual donations to forest conservation. I did eventually find them listed as a corporate partner (AKA donor) on the American Forests . org website. It's nice to see companies giving back to the environment."
"This tea is the best ever and it is always delivered on time.  I have gotten many people hooked on this tea.  Please always offer this tea.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />PG"
"I have been searching for a power bar with high protein and very low sugar do to health reasons.  This is the perfect solution.  Tastes great...no cardboard taste here!!  The whey chocolate tastes like chocolate.  I almost feel guilty eating it!!  During vists with family and friends during Easter I was able to contain my urges during desert time.  While everyone else was chowing down on sugary cakes, pies and chocolate, I whipped out my protein bar and felt like part of the group!<br /><br />Thank you for the awesome product.  I will be ordering a lot more."
I got a sample of this in my Summer VoxBox and it was love at first taste!!!<br />Try them warmed up a bit with a nice cold glass of Almond milk and you are in heaven!<br />I will definitely buy these again and again!
"I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings."
the after taste was slightly different.... I did not like it.....maybe it is something in the cereal that is artificial....don't know...will not buy anymore of it....  Quaker high fiber cinnamon swirl.....am returning it to the grocery store..... package has 2013 date on it.... that means that it is fresh... but the aftertaste is not good....
One word for this product would be: Amazing. It great for interstitial cystitis! I have very bad interstitial cystitis and i ordered this tea and it work wonders for my condition
"Ostrim beef and ostrich snacks are pretty tasty. I expected them to be a bit spicier, but they are good as they are. I needed another protein snack to supplement protein shakes and protein bars. The whole ostrich thing piqued my curiosity so I bought them. They are convenient to carry in my pocket while at work and the price is right. I will almost surely buy more."
"I've been eating Ranch Style Beans all my life and love them.  They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years.  This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio.  That's not all that was changed.  The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce.  Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER.  They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says ""Beans"" and I expect beans...not water.  Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand.  Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water.  And why would anyone pay almost $50 for a case?  I can buy them at Sam's Wholesale Club for $12.00 a case."
"We have a new puppy who has to take antibiotics twice a day for kennel cough.  The puppy hates the pills and it took a lot of time and stress to get him to take them.  I did an internet search and found out about pill pockets.  I didn't buy from Amazon because I needed them right away, I paid $13 at Petco.  They are a lifesaver, we have the beef flavor and he eats it right up.  He loves them.<br /><br />Since the antibiotics will use up almost the whole bag I'm putting in an order through Amazon for more pill pockets to keep on hand."
"I love Shin Ramyun. I was introduced to it in college when my roommate would visit an Asian market. This stuff is HOT and delicious. When boiling, I add an egg to the mix. I highly recommend it."
"Each packet of this soup is NOT single serving size!<br /><br />...and the packaging does very little to correct that misperception: the soup is shown in a coffee mug-sized scenario. You're supposed to add 4 cups of water to each packet; which is more soup than anyone is looking for at lunchtime. Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons? You're supposed to forget that consuming a reasonable amount of soup fills you with 100 percent (if not more) of your daily sodium intake.<br /><br />This is an absurd product."
"Always on the lookout for a new coffee adventure, I took the plunge with this very expensive grind (almost $2/oz!), based upon all the glowing reviews here. The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO"">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee. The Don Francisco 100% Colombia Supremo coffee is still the best I've ever tasted -- at any price.<br /><br />'nuff said."
"I've purchased Cracovia Herring Filets for my father a number of times. It would not be a Polish Christmas for us without them!  The jar is large, and the herring is delicious. The pickling is very slightly sweet and the cream and onions offset the pickled fish perfectly!  Can't say enough good things about this product, the family LOVES it and we can only get it here, on amazon.com! LOVE IT!"
"The rice turns out excellent, which is quite a surprise considering how easy it is to make.  Granted it is very sticky, but they do call it sticky rice now don't they?  Throw some cucumber or something else in, and you have sushi.  For best results, spring for some real nori, such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKWZWA"">Eden Sushi Nori, Toasted Sea Vegetable, 0.6-Ounce Packets  (Pack of 6)</a>, as what's included are small strips of very thin seaweed."
"I Love Green Tea, and this powdered Green Tea mix is very soothing. also you can prepare it in so many different ways. You can make smoothies, milkshakes, whatever.  And of course it is so healthy"
"I love banana flavored things, but these were too sweet, left a bad taste in my mouth, and were pretty chewy.  I ended up throwing them out."
"The ingredients clearly say ""evaporated cane juice"".  That is sugar.  Amazon needs to change the description."
"I have a cocker spaniel who loves treat and though that this nugget help me with his oral care but he spitted it every time I tried, probably does not like the flavor."
"These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an ""off"" batch."
I was looking for a mild flavored tea that I could use to make a lemon tea and this organic chamomile tea is perfect. It does have a lovely aroma but I don't like drinking it without adding the juice of half a lemon and a packet of stevia. Then I add a little honey. I'd recommend using two tea bags for one cup or mug.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
"They taste good and in nice little individual packages so you can take them with you anywhere you go. Have not tried the vanilla version, but i am hooked. They are moist and soft, you can see the honey, dont we all eat with our eyes first?"
"I used this product on my 9 week old kittens.  Instead of using 5 drops for kittens and cats over 12 weeks, I used 3 drops every other day.  I also cleaned out the ears completely first before putting the drops in.  After 2 treatments, they appear to be ear mite free."
"I had been craving fruitcake during the holidays but couldn't find the time to go get one locally so I purchased these last week to share with family and friends.<br /><br />They arrived well packaged in a large box, then inside was a smaller box with 10 individually boxed fruit cakes. They are the same fruitcakes you purchase at stores except each one comes in an indvidual cardboard box. This is great if you plan to gift these because it makes a more presentable package and will probably keep them fresher. I was impressed that each one had its own box.<br /><br />These also arrived very soft and fresh like they had been shipped soon after they were made and not sitting around in a warehouse all year. These are the freshest I've had including when I purchased them at local stores.<br /><br />They sell these locally for $3.99 each plus tax. However, the price on Amazon is cheaper than I bought them on the Claxton website and I prefer to buy from Amazon. I will purchase these again next year and would recommend them."
"This might be one of the most liked dog treats, but my dog hated it.<br />She licked it, put it in her mouth, and spat it right out.<br />It smells really bad too. I had it in an airtight ziplock bag, but the smell was so strong, my whole car smelled like it the rest of the day.<br />I guess I'll donate it to the shelter or something..."
"These are nothing like chips, but they are very yummy. The bbq flavor is delicious. The texture is light and crunchy. Costco sells a large bag for $5. I also bought the lunch size on Amazon of 24 .8 bags. These don't taste like a diet food and are very satisfying. They are not greasy."
"I LOVE this cereal...Of course I am a sugar-aholic.  I liked the strawberry filled ones too, but they didn't have as strong a strawberry flavor to me.  When you eat the frosting topped ones, the milk and strawberry frosting mixes together and it's like eating biscuits dipped in strawberry milk!  Yummmmm!"
Fantastic movie style poporn.  Easy to prepare and great tasting.  Taste just like at the movies but contains too much salt.(just like the movie popcorn).
"As a Celiac (gluten) who's allergic to diary and eggs, I have a hard time finding easy-to-grab snacks. These cashew clusters are SO amazingly yummy that I still marvel at the fact that I can safely eat them. They're certified by the GIG - so you know they're safe from cross contamination from gluten. Yay! Buy some  Mareblu Cashew Crunch - you'll love it!!!"
Timothy makes a good decaf.  It is a medium flavored blend that works for both my husband and me.  He uses the largest size on our Keurig and I use the medium size as I like a bolder coffee.
"I get this item today (7/16/2012), tried two bags (just a little bit). And then strew them away. Junk! Taste like old vegetable oil soaked. Oxidized I guess. Package is very cheap. Should listen to all 1 star reviews. The expiring date is 12/12. For the money I paid (&lt;$4), I will not return this item. Amazon should not sell this product, although it was made in USA."
I found this particular green tea to be to bitter tasting.  I will not order again.
"First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!"
Love the coffee and the best price. Arrived fast and reliabe. I will order more as soon as we run low.
"4 level tablespoons have 14grams of insoluble fiber!!! and that my friends is a ""buttload"" no pun intended..wow. this stuff can be added to breads and cakes etc.. I cut it with muscle milk because musclemilk has very little fiber.. I like to blend 6 tablespoons of nutiva, 1 cup musclemilk and 3/4 cup of frothy boiled instant coffee. it heats the mm and nutiva just enough to give it the impression of malted goodness."
"Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM"">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2"">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>"
"This stuff truly is delicious! It doesn't taste exactly like marshmallows, but its puffy, sticky texture is wonderful! Try it in hot chocolate, on top of cupcakes, or by the spoonful with some chocolate chips. Once mine was all gone, I just wanted more. Perfect for any vegan with a sweet tooth."
This product tasted good and was a great alternative to the salted version.  I was happy to find this online since it is not available in the local grocery stores.
"I feed this to all my cats, including the one with allergies who was previously on an overly expensive prescription product. I have had great results and it has not been any worse (might even be better) for my allergic cat. I love the ingredients and the fact that there pieces of real veggies and fruit mixed in. My cats also like this food more than their previous ones. The price can't be beat and I don't have to make an extra trip to the store."
"My daughter loves these waffles, she did not like the Van's waffles at all, very hard and almost ""stale"" like.  These are made in the microwave and taste like fresh waffles.  The first time I made them, they were a bit doughy, but I just microwaved a few seconds longer and then toasted--so delicious and EASY!!"
This tea is delightfully spiced!  I brew it strong; mix it with milk and sweetner and it is almost like having a candy treat without the calories of a prepared spiced chai powder!  Haven't missed drinking this tea each morning for two years.  It goes everywhere with me.  It has the most flavor of any of the spiced chai's I have tried.
"This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result. The lack of bitterness is a definitely a plus."
"While diet grape Faygo isn't *THE BEST* diet grape soda out there, it is one of the few that you can find pretty easily and generally offers a good value.  This particular offering, and many others for that matter, do not reflect that value.  If you're paying more than $7.00 for a 24pk of cans, then you're paying too much (not including shipping) because this is on of the few you can order direct from the company."
"Started purchasing this as an alternative to organic milk due to the radiation from Fukushima showing up in US milk. It's very tasty, and to me it taste just like milk.<br /><br />With Amazon's ""subscribe and save"" I end-up saving a penny over buying the 64oz organic Rice dream container from my local grocer.  However with Amazon, I get better customer service and don't have to deal with the grumpy and at times unfriendly folks at the grocer. Being priced at $2.14 a quart, organic rice dream is also cheaper than organic milk which is about $3.59 a quart (32 oz) at Walmart.<br /><br />This particular rice dream is organic and for those who are concerned, it is also gluten free.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon sells this for exactly 8.45 cents per ounce. Walmart sells the 64oz for $3.24 = 5.06 cents per ounce.  I think it will be tough for Amazon to compete with traditional grocers on food."
"These colors are so true to life and vibrant!  The drip, drop out of the bottle makes it so easy to duplicate the exact same color again.  The food color doesn't change the taste or texture of any food.  I had no problems with shipping, and it was super fast."
"We LOVE this juice - veggies, no added sugar and an easy to use (and re-use) bottle.  Fabulous!  Wish it weren't $2/bottle, but I guess it is a case of getting what you pay for!"
"These candies are off the chain I have been looking for them for like years and they are so awesome, please hurry and make them available."
"I actually bought this just for the jars to use as party favor gifts!  But I figured I would feed the food to my 10 month old daughter.  She eats just about anything, but wouldn't touch the bananas.  I don't blame her.  They smelled awful and they were pink.  But she ate the apples and pears just fine with her plain yogurt.  I wouldn't buy this food again for the food.  The pouches with mixed fruits are much better."
"I just love this strong blend of teas, PG Tips was given to me as a gift and I have searched for it until I had the good sense and good luck to find it on Amazon.com.  I ordered a large supply which won't last long for us, so will be ordering more in the future. Thanks Amazon.com from a very grateful Scottish Lass..."
"I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense. Cytomax helps with that."
"I haven't had soda or carbonation in years. I got this for my parents who, to avoid sugar, drink nothing but aspartame filled fresca black cherry and peach. Figuring that is so much worse, I was so excited to find Zevia and currently am awaiting my parents to try the flavors. I myself grabbed a Dr. Zevia because I loved Dr. Pepper back when I used to drink soda. Now it has been years, so I cracked it open and noted a considerable spice and cherry smell. I took a sip and felt a punch to the throat like I downed some great tasting apple cider vinegar. That's not a problem with this product, it's just what happens when you haven't had carbonated drinks in years. It tastes just like Dr. Pepper, maybe a little bit like a diet but that's not a problem because it tastes great all the same AND you're not compromising your health. This is the benefit of capitalism, someone wants a better product, someone makes a better product. I want to get everyone I know on this stuff and off of their monsters, fresca's, diet pepsi's and so on..."
"The sauce I ordered made it to my doorstep very quickly. Additionally, it arrived in perfect condition just as it was described online. Overall, I am very pleased with my experience and would definitely purchase this item again."
"Absolutely the best candy out there! Fresh! Brought back my childhood and made me eat too much! The cream filling was soft and wonderful, and the caramel was some of the best I've ever eaten."
You guys must be out of your minds!  You can buy a box of eight pouches in any grocery store for under $6.  Who in their right mind would pay over $30 with shipping?
"I have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. I find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. It is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. One of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy, which for me it works. This oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored. I will definitely continue to purchase it."
"These pouches are the next best to homemade.  When I don't have time to steam and blend my own baby food, I always reach for happy baby!"
"After I prepare the pizza crust as directed then I put it into a pan and top the pizza crust with my favorite ingredients, then I put it into the oven at 350 degrees until the cheese is melted.  Taste great and is crispy."
"My cat LOVES Fancy Feast cat food; and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event! He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Ocean Whitefish & Tuna Feast; eight more cans of Savory Salmon Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sole & Shrimp Feast. Very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too."
"Of all the ""Subscribe and Save"" products, this is the one I've been waiting for -- Rosarita refried beans are a real staple, my #1 comfort food and #1 earthquake-preparedness food. With my Prime membership this works out to about a dollar a can, which is a decent price, and these cans are heavy to lug home on foot from the market! Add a tablespoon of chicken stock or water if the beans are too thick for your tastes. They're ideal with scrambled eggs, you want them to make a burrito out of, they're great on their own, maybe with some salsa or grated cheese -- I really love these beans. Very highly recommended! I'd read that Californians who had moved with their jobs back east to the Carolinas would have people visiting California ask ""Do you want me to bring you some beans?"" -- they're that iconic and that good. I've made my own refried beans from scratch and it's not a simple task. I am so pleased to be able to buy these from amazon.com!!!<br />--<br />Help!! The price went from $22 to $42 in two months!!!! Not such a great deal any more!!!"
"We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods."
"I have only used one bag so far, but I put in a 2-lb salmon fillet glazed with an apple juice reduction and the results were so delicious that my family of three ate the entire fillet in one sitting.  Neither my husband, nor my daughter have ever even liked salmon before.  It was incredibly easy, the directions are very clear, and best of all:  no mess to clean up!"
"I love this product. Tastes just like the one I am used to from home. Some people complain its hard, well this is the hard one so I don't know what their expectations were. There is also a soft version. I purposely ordered the hard nougat one. I grew up on this and it is amazing. Just like the chunk you can buy off the huge block in New York. I will definitely be ordering over and over again. They gained a repeat customer out of me! I am so glad I found this because I am 7 months pregnant and was craving this terribly, so glad I found it. My initial order was 2 (6 bars)!"
I was so disappointed in this product...it had a horrible aftertaste...no matter how little I used  - the taste linger in your mouth for hours...very bad taste...not recommended at all.
"I have purchased several other Amaryllis from this seller, but none of them compare to the Thanksgiving Orange Amaryllis.  The color is amazing and adds so much life to my living room."
I am a big peanut butter lover I just hate the calories and fat that it contains. This product gives me great tasting peanut butter without the guilt. I would reccomend everyone to try it.
"Buffalo Bill rides again.  These ""Extra Smokeys"" have very strong smoked flavor, which I have been looking (or drooling) for quite a few years.  By far the best smoked meat snack available in the USA that I know of.  Overall flavor is excellent, though somewhat on the ""extra peppery"" side.  And a little pricey at $1 each.  And don't even think of doing this at home if you wear dentures--these sticks are quite tough.<br />I will order more within the month, excellent service form Choo Choo R Snacks, and they even give you a bonus beef jerky sample to try.<br />""Extra Smokeys"" really smoke!"
Bought this for my daughter who loved flavored coffees.  This is a good one.  Add a few drops of real vanilla extract and it is outstanding as well.  Enjoy!
"delicious but very sweet. If you are just looking for a suttle flavor of maple this is not it. Altough the tea in itself is strong, which counters the sweetness, I would still say that it's very sweet."
"This is a fragrant treat that is great for an in-between meal snack for my little puffball, a 6 year old lovable Bichon Frise.  He deserves to be pampered.  He's sensitive to treats that have a harder consistency.  However, cognizant of treats like these, I hand feed him.  It gives us some time to bond.  I held the treat for him, as he licked the cracker, and bit with his molars.  No difficulty for him, at all.<br /><br />Lamb treats are usually foul in smell and they're just as worse on the way out, too.  I acquired these with a little hesitation.<br /><br />I prefer natural snacks for my dog since he truly deserves the best.  Organic treats and organic diets are what I feed him.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great reward but not ideal for training purposes given the 5 cm size.  From the other end (please do mind the pun), it did not constipate him or give him runny stool - he has a sensitive GI tract.<br /><br />My dog loves it."
"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free."
"I ordered 18 bags of York Pieces for wedding favors, half of the bags were melted and Amazon has a no return policy on food items. I would not order food products from a online vendor again."
"WARNING!! Without changing the look of the packaging, Greens+ has changed the ingredients and has ruined a once-great bar (I along with other loyal customers I knew would order them by the boxload). Supposedly to ""increase production,"" they've ruined the 40:30:30 balance, adding far more calories, fat, and carbs, while decreasing protein content. Sad, as they were once the perfect energy bar... I'm still in mourning. I am sending all boxes back directly to the company. Hopefully, if enough people do so, they can be persuaded to continue manufacturing the old formula, as I'm willing to wait and stock up on the original product, but not this pale imitation..."
"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!  Maybe they'll be better when I dip them in some quacamole or something."
Thank you for the shipment of the Saf-T-Pops to replace the order that I previously had - it was a very nice and unexpected surprise.<br />This batch is much better where the wrapper doesn't stick to the candy.<br /><br />Just another reason for me to keep using your service - it's much appreciated!
"This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now."
"My 14 year old was recently diagnosed with celiac.  It has been difficult finding snacks that she enjoys and can bring to school.  We have found these pretzels to be great, really delicious.  Even her friends prefer them to regular pretzels."
These are great! I can't stop eating these! The amount of wasabi flavor was perfect for me. I am definitely going to have to try the other flavors
"Although this product accomplished the mission of getting my cat to take his pill, the side effect of the horrible diarrhea he got from these was definitely not worth it. He does have a sensitive tummy, so if your cat does as well, I'd skip these or you might end up with problem bigger than trying to get your cat to take a pill."
"Xylitol looks and acts so much more like real sugar than other<br />alternative sweeteners. It doesn't have an aftertaste, it dissolves<br />completely, and it measures like sugar. I also like the fact<br />that a sweetener can be good for your dental health. I chose Emerald<br />Forest because it is made in America (not China) and it is<br />natural. I will definitely continue to buy this product."
"My grandpa used to tell stories about eating this stuff in his Army days.  They called it ""hardtack"" or just simply ""tack"".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local ""gourmet food and liquor"" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was ""stale"".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.  Oh, it's also healthy and stuff.  Lots of fiber.<br /><br />I highly recommend the hearty rye.  Buy a few cases now to prepare for Y2012 :)"
"Very smooth, never bitter. Wonderful for me because this is a low acid coffee and if you have problems with heartburn this coffee is a good choice."
"I really like this tea, but the bags are packed too tightly. The hot water doesn't get into the tea leaves in the teabag. I haven't tried yet but it will probably make a great sun tea. It's a great price for white tea and I have a subscribe and save delivery scheduled. Prince of Peace White Tea is the best."
"My brother got me hooked on mint juleps last summer.  When it is miserably hot they are so refreshing.  I use one part mint syrup to two parts Maker's Mark.  This mint syrup makes it so easy.  My only complaint is the caps on the bottles are pretty flimsy and were broken and leaking when they arrived.  However, they replaced them right away without any problems."
"These are very good.  Are they exactly like oreos? No but they have a very good taste.  My problem was keeping my teenage sons out of them, they are not gluten intolerant, so my husband could have them, who is allergic to gluten."
"Killer Cookies...I buy them every year, my favorite! Don't hesitate to try these, I can eat a whole box myself!"
I thought I was getting a bargain because this is less expensive then R.W. knudsen brand - but isnt near as strong I add 4 oz of RW to 32 oz water and it still has a bite to it- this takes 2 times as much and still doesnt have the same effect- I had signed up for auto deliver  after trying it had to cancel.
"Our shih-tzu loves these but then he loves pretty much anything that's edible. These are actually good for them and smell good enough for people to eat, although I leave the tasting to the dog."
"I cheer every year, even if it is still 102 degrees and I see that Starbucks is offering pumpkin spice latte.  The only thing I don't cheer about is the price for this addictive habit.  Now, I can make a pumpkin spice latte that ALMOST tastes like the ones a barrista makes and I don't have to leave a tip!  This flavored coffee has very good  flavors, especially of nutmeg but cinnamon and cloves are in there too.  Like all these coffees, using really hot water and stirring for at least a minute, makes a better cup and prevents the bottom of the cup residue.  This is a light coffee, not a strong robust one so don't think it is going to wake you up in the morning if you did something the night before you shouldn't have!  But it is very nice mid-day or evening treat and won't keep you awake unless you are sensitive to small amounts of caffeine.  You don't really want to serve it with dessert because it is too much like dessert itself but some vanilla flavored cookies go nicely with it."
I send this for my son's lunch.  He is on the gfcfsf diet for autism and he enjoys this as a milk sub.  Amazon's subscribe and save makes it affordable.
"This relatively simple innovation has absolutely saved the tender relationship I have with my cat.  As she was recently diagnosed asthmatic, I am now forced to administer up to 2 prednisone pills to my incredibly finicky, active and resistant 7yo Bombay mix.  Before I found these I was struggling with the ""pill popper""; even when that gadget successfully hit the target, I was forced to watch her foam vehemently at the mouth when the easily-dissolved and extremely bitter pill it launched hit any part of her tongue or back of her mouth, forcing her to choke - not to mention battling the scratches from the pour soul who thought her mom was poisoning her with this awful medicine.  Amazingly she liked both flavors of these pockets, and now gobbles them down - pills safely tucked inside - without so much as a shake of her head.  I'm forever grateful to Greenies for coming up with this great product - they have saved me years more of struggles with a cat forced to take daily pills!"
"I'm not a connoisseur of fine teas.  But, I do enjoy my tea, and gunpowder green has been a favorite of mine.  A big problem, though, is trying to find it.  There is a tea store near by that is very expensive.  If you buy 2 oz or more, it's $4.00 an oz.  Too expensive.  I finally found a couple of health food stores where it ranges in price from about 70 to 85 cents an oz, but it is such a hassle to drive there; and too many times they're out.  I've found it on-line, but the shipping costs haven't made it such a good deal.<br /><br />Well, with the ""subscription"" purchase, this is a great deal.  It's cheaper than anywhere I've found it, at $10.20 a pound or less than 64 cents an oz.  And I love that 48 hrs after placing the order, the post office delivered it to my house.<br /><br />So, the big test, then, is how is the tea?  Well, like I said, I'm not a connoisseur, but I do enjoy Davidson's Gunpowder Green.  It's as good as any that I've bought.  Since the stores where I have been buying it are anywhere from 10 to 25 miles away, and not even near anywhere I normally go, I can say that I have found my new source for tea.  I would recommend it if you're looking for a great deal on a very good tea."
The product I received was in good condition but wasn't what I thought I was getting. Whenit said small can lid I thought it was for the smallest cat food cans. This is for what I would call regular size cat food cans. I won't be able to use it but it is not worth my money to send it back so I will give it to someone else or donate it.
"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?"
I am a very picky eater who has had very successful gastric bypass surgery and weight loss and I'm very careful about what I eat.  It has to taste great and be nutritious.  Now that I'm in maintenance I can have complex carbs that have a healthy high protein/low carb ratio and healthy fats.  I keep a bag in my car so if I go to a Mexican restaurant I can have a little bit of salsa and chips.
Yummy! Stores do not sale cans of this product- (just single serve pouches). You get far more product for your $ buying the can.  LOVE this product and only 25 cal.! (tip: I like to add a little zero cal.  sweetener) Drink up baby!!!
"This has a very nice taste. Fruity but with the tea behind it. Though it tastes a bit more like fruit flavored with tea then the reverse. I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating. I don't like getting chunks of the powder through my straw as its a bit shocking!"
I've tried most commercial brands and find I like this the best. It is great for making a mocha.
"We recently gave these a try after seeing them displayed at Starbucks.  I thought it would be handy to toss in the diaper bag for a just-in-case snack.  We pulled one out during a long day out with our 14 month old, and she sucked it down!  She even figured out rather quickly how to squeeze the bag and feed it to herself (with a little help when she reaches the end, of course), so we have ordered them by the case and will keep a few in the bag at all times!  A real lifesaver for those times we are stuck out without quick access to healthy snacks (these are entirely fruit - nothing else).  Great find, and slightly cheaper through Amazon."
"Weaver's is not the first Sumatra coffee but it surely is the best out there.  You have to try it to believe it.  Better yet, do what I did --  I gave several bags of the whole bean Sumatra organic to an important client as a corporate gift and, for the first time after receiving a food product, the client raved about how great tasting Weaver's was and then ordered it for their office full time.  They realized that great tasting coffee need not be the exception but can and should be the norm.  The Weaver Sumatra Organic Whole Bean is my favorite of the Weaver line of excellent coffees and teas.  Try it and see for yourself!"
"*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
"I am on a mini mission to tell people how horrid this Newman's con Queso tastes- we just threw it out.  Don't buy it.  I'm not sure what it's made if, but it ain't cheese folks.  How could a guy that I've always respected put his name on something so awful with proceeds going to charity?  Hello- you have little proceeds with products like this!  I am hoping that this product is an aberration and not the norm.<br />We did not buy this on amazon (where I frequently shop), but here's a forum where people who care can ensure others of their experiences- just sayin'."
"I was looking for a better quality food for my dog and I did a little research and tried this one. She actually eats the food when I put it in her dish rather than staring at it all day until the cat tries to eat it, then she would only eat it so the cat wouldn't. This food she really seems to like and it hasn't affected her digestion any that I have noticed. I would buy it again. Great price too!"
"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you."
"This cookie is so soft and taste amazing! I was so surprised with how moist and chewy it was, better than home made, believe it or not. My whole family were begging for more, highly recommend trying this!"
"Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand ""Beef Stew"" and Wellness brand ""Lamb and Beef Stew"", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy."
"This pasta is so good.  I have served it several times to non-GF guests and no one can tell that it's gluten free.  Do keep in mind though that it is only 12 oz (the non-organic comes in a 16 oz bag).  For my family of four (2 being small children), one bag is barely enough to feed us all."
Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad.<br />Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine.<br />Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct.<br />I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon.<br />Will not use it again.
"I keep trying different types of chocolate and just keep coming back to this one.  It's a pity that you have to buy 12 of them here, because everyone should try it at least once."
"I LOVED this product...tasted wonderful. Much better than any other, and only 25 cal. serving. I used in my coffee every morning. But when I went to reorder today, the price for a 4 pak of 7.3oz cannisters is now $39.95 instead of $18.75 when I ordered from Amazon April 6 2011. I'm sorry to lose this treat, but the price rise is a deal killer."
"I love granola cereal and since I'm watching my weight, I decided to try the Kashi GO LEAN Crunch. Well, needless to say, it is not satisying my granola cereal craving at all. It is totally lacking in flavor and texture. I guess some things you just can't mess with and one of them is granola. IMO, LIGHT granola is just that, ""light""-weight. I'm going back to the Quaker Oats 100% Natural Granola Cereal, which by the way, does include raisins and almonds so I don't have to add my own."
We had heard so much about these and were excited to get some for our Great Dane.  He had no interest at all and went back to his rawhide bone. A friend's black lab was thrilled to get them so I gave them 3-Stars.  You might only buy one until you know that they are your Fido's bone of choice!
One of my dogs is an extremely picky eater so when I find a food he will eat without a problem I can safely recommend it to everyone.
"These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice."
I use this product in my whey protein drink. It has great taste and only a fraction of the fat. There are 220 calories in 2 TB of regular PB and only 45 in this version. I took the product with me camping. It mixed well with water for a great sandwich.
"OK, for those that think they may be buying a grain free product, DON'T BUY THIS.  My yellow lab is bad with any grains and causes her to have asthma attacks (really, really bad attacks).  Tried this first time last night and she woke up coughing and wheezing.  WTF I thought and sure enough, it has oat bran in it.  My stupid dumb ***, I trust Newman's to have a product accurately reflecting the products on the label.  Brown rice and chicken aren't oats.  I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.  I will continue to use Amazon for most of my shopping, given the incredible value of unlimited 2 day shipping for $75/year"
I recently got a Keurig machine.  These are definately my favorite k-cups.  Some of the other brands I've tried have been too harsh / bitter for my taste.  Caribou is very smooth.
"As a vet tech with tens years experience it is my opinion that this is the worst dog food on the market. Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills."
"This is good, flavorful coffee, but just not quite the right blend for me.<br />There are others I like more, so will not be ordering it again.  Good price from Amazon, though."
"I was looking for something different in a diet soda, so I ordered a few of the Hansen flavors.  All are overly sweet, but the Tangerine Lime is, in my opinion, undrinkable.  Too sweet and an odd aftertaste.  I'll stick with Fresca and Sunkist Diet Orange."
"I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called ""premium"" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  ""Lamb meal"" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat."
"I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G"">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee."
"I thought the bars would taste better. They were good and peanut buttery taste, but felt they were a little dry. They are great protein bars and would recommend them!"
I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.
"This pasta is amazing.  I can't find it at my local grocer.  The vender was great-- rushed it to me right away.  I make this salad that is every kids favorite and sure to please at any potluck called ""Frogs Eye Salad"".  Try it!!"
"After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites."
With all the coffees around it is refreshing to have an Etheopian grind that tastes this good.  Although I do not have the proper coffee maker for this coffee I opened the bag and brewed it in my Mr. Coffee using the measured amount I usually use. No acidity or bitterness yet distinctive Ethiopian beans and flavor.
"I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this."
"...this coffee tastes horrible.<br /><br />Having not learned my lesson to never look a gift horse in the mouth, I complain every chance I get about this smelly swill my employer buys to caffeinate the troops. In fact, it is this sort of indiscretion that lead me to bringing my own press pots, digital gram scale, and Costco french roast (yes, lowly mass-batched beans!) to work.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a caffeine buzz, this will do the trick. But the cost is an acidic after taste that camps out on the tongue for the next few hours. Usually, I equate lighter roasts such as these with ""inoffensive,"" i.e. suitable for general audiences, including those who don't want a coffee to overwhelm them. Some (myself included) might even say ""bland.""  In acts of desperation when supplies are running low, I've supplemented my mellow dark roast with a scoop or two of this -- and its ""flavor"" adds a sour exclamation point that can't be masked.<br /><br />I'm not the only one who detests this brew: a few of my coworkers have similar sentiments, though are either too cheap to bring their own, or just aren't as passionate (aka abnormal) as I. And maybe this is work's way of cutting down on coffee consumption, which isn't all bad since there are Peet's and Starbucks nearby."
"The Maine Lobsters arrived on time and were nice and big. They were shared by four of us and we were all delighted at the taste and freshness. They were excellent and will will buy from this company again. Soon, I hope. Thanks."
"This was my favourite brand of cod liver, it's hard to find in Toronto, so I buy a dozen at a time when I find it. However, the last purchase, every one of the cans I opened was very lightly packed, about one third liver and the rest just oil. Even worse, the liver had dark, grey spots that would turn my stomach just looking at them. Perhaps good cod liver has become a thing of the past, like many other delicacies. I would prefer if they just raised the price to whatever it needs to be to provide the quality that we deserve when we spend our hard earned money, or, if that's not possible, just let the fish live and make soyburgers or something."
"My 9 yr old Jackie has always been a fussy eater. Even finding treats she likes has been a challange. Once she hit 5 yrs she started getting plaque buildup that required annual cleaning. Last year we started giving her CET AquaDent in her water and this Jan we added C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to boost in the cleaning. Not only is it helping to keep her teeth cleaner, breath fresher, but she absolutely LOVES them. When ""treat time"" is approaching she begins ""woofing"" to remind us of the time. When I open the bag she is fixated on me until I give it to her. She gets so excited over something that seems to be good for her. Finally she reacts like a dog to something to eat!!"
"No complaints here. Will order again, recommend to others, and spend the money I saved buying this on something else."
"The Leonidas chocolates being peddled in the USA bear little/no resemblance to those available in Europe. After enjoying Leonidas in Germany (Aachen and Munich) for many years I placed an order here in New York State. What I received was (a) crudely presented boxes of (b) thick, hard-shelled (c) anonymous flavoured cream centres. With the exception of the coffee creams (which were more or less as I remember them from Europe) the rest of the box seemed to consist of two undefinable centres. Extremely disappointed with this order. The Godiva selection my mother received for Christmas was FAR superior in every respect -- packaging, presentation, appearance, texture, taste. I won't buy Leonidas in the USA again."
"My doctor recently suggested (strongly) that I cut out my 3+ cups of coffee per day. Now mind you, I am a Starbucks drinker. I LOVE my coffee and I have for years. I told my doctor and myself that this was not possible. However, I re-thought and considering my health issues, I decided to take the plunge, so to speak. . . into the No-coffee, no caffeine pool. But what to substitute on those cold mornings??? I have enjoyed Stash Chai tea for a few years but it was always a treat for winter days when I was already over-coffeed. I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd. I no longer need that cup of jolt any longer and I am fully satisfied by my STASH decaf chai. I am amazed and delighted! I want to stock up on my tea, lest they stop making it! Heaven forbid! I get my STASH with the regular subscription monthly. Can't be without my STASH Decaf Chai!"
"Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family."
"A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally."
"I use jar foods when I am on the go or if I did not have time to leave the babysitter food. I made a majority of my twins food from scratch using the baby bullet, a chopper or just by mashing it. Now that my twins are 11months they have been eating table food. I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste. However, I would not have purchased if I knew it would be so thin."
"We love this seasoning - in burritos, in chili, in whatever we want some smokey ZIP.  First purchased at SAMS CLUB ages ago, but they don't stock it any longer.  Relieved to find it through Amazon, and bought one to give to a friend so that they, too, will get hooked!"
Very hard to find plain pumpkin seeds in the US.  They are excellent for prostate health.  These are plain raw seeds with nothing added.
I bought this chocolate recently from Amazon and it has become our favorite dessert after dinner. The chocolate is not too sweet (like the regular ones) and has a great balance with the cacao content (not bitter). We love it and would recommend this product.
Product was so poorly packed it split open spilling toxic chemicals all over.<br />Had to throw the whole thing in the garbage.
"I was not expecting the way these K-cups were made.  The plastic collar on top with the exposed coffee filled filter hanging below is ingenius and I can see where it saves on throwing extra plastic in the landfills.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers that in order to keep each cup fresh, you will have to empth the bag into a ziplck bag or a plastic container with a sealed, locking lid.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The coffee is excellant and very comparable to the other brands and it is cheaper if you use the subscribe and save."
"You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink."
This is the best pancake mix ever.  I have tried many gluten free brands and this exceeds any of them and the price is great!
"very flavorful granola mix, excellent dried cranberries, even gluten eating folks will enjoy this healthy mix of grains and dried fruit"
I love the taste of this gum!  It actually holds its taste longer than any other sugar free or sugar gum I have tasted.  It also leaves you mouth feeling fresh after chewing.  Great product!
I love the Sharkies I just purchased. The flavor is the best so far and they work like a charm for all my long runs!
"Great seller, fast shipping! I love these cookies! I have many allergies and I have no problems when eating these. I will be ordering more."
"No, this is NOT Nutella. Nutella is made with hazelnuts, so almond butter will taste different. This also has 7 gr of sugar to Nutella's 20 gr (per 2 Tbsp), so it definately isn't as ooey-gooey sweet as Nutella. But if you want the best chocolate nut butter around, this is it.<br /><br />I've tried all of Justin's nut butters - peanut, hazelnut, etc - and I definately like chocolate almond the best. But I like regular almond butter more than peanut butter anyway.<br /><br />As a former Nutella addict, this doesn't have the smooth, creamy consistency of Nutella. It is more coarsely ground nuts. If you want smooth & creamy, you might want to try I.M Healthy's chocolate soy nut butter. I like that a lot too and it's got the smooth consistency that some demand.<br /><br />But this one is the best! Great almond taste and rich chocolate taste!"
"My 2 dogs go crazy over this food!  I made the decision to switch them to it after reviewing all the dry dog foods out there.  My 6 year old Boxer has had a sensitive stomach all her life and many days had to be coaxed to eat.  Not any more!  She is always eager to eat and hasn't had an upset stomach since they started on this about 4 months ago.  You don't feed as much as other foods and they started gaining weight on this at first, so I have to watch that.  But they look so healthy now!  I also get the canned Merrick food, which they get a spoonful of, along with the dry.  They love all the canned foods too.  I also wish Amazon would carry this food.  But I have found one place where the price isn't too bad.  A 30 pound bag will last my 2 dogs about a month and a half."
I just received Pack of 40 and planning to order it again.This noodle soup is the healthiest noodle soup if compare to other noodle soup.No fat or just total fat=0.5 g to compare to other noodle soup with total fat=12 g to 22 g .And this noodle soup is delicious too.
"This is a light to medium roast, wish it was slightly stronger, but the flavor is good and I am having it every morning using 2 6 oz. k-cups pumps to make it as strong as possible."
"This was one of the best extra-bold coffees that I have EVER had!  If you like Sumatran Reserve and Dark Magic, you'll like this coffee even more.  I will definately buy more of this!!"
"THESE CHIPS HAVE A VERY UNIQUE CRUNCH, AND ARE VERY TASTY. I NOW BUY THE VARIETY PACKS BECAUSE I LIKE ALL 6 FLAVORS. THE SINGLE SERVE BAGS YIELD 1 POINT, PER MY WEIGHTWATCHER AFFICIANADO WIFE."
"Today's lunch: steak tips with carmelized onion. Sliced yellow carrots with white beans, spinach, and garlic. AND...<br /><br />Oven roasted sweet potato fries with TACO BELL CHIPOTLE SAUCE.  Delicious!<br /><br />Never mind the first two items on the menu (they were good, too!:>) This review is about the Chipotle sauce.<br /><br />Now, I'd planned to use it on the steak tips, but decided to try a sweet/hot combo with the sweet potato fries. It was GREAT!  Just the right amount of heat, and cheese flavor which brought out the sweetness of the fries.<br /><br />To complete this review, I scrambled a few eggs, added drained, diced tomato, and some CHIPOTLE sauce. Again, great results.<br /><br />This sauce seems to take on a new flavor depending what you pair it with.  My next plan is to try it on chicken wraps.<br /><br />I'm sure it will be just as good as with the two recipes I've tried so far.<br /><br />Quick and convenient, it's worth a try!"
Fast shipping! Loved the product! I made crawfish etouffe and it was a big hit.  Thank you again for offering this product online.
"I tried these as I had already ordered the regular Snyder's pretzels.  They are very good and very hot.!  If you don't like ""hot stuff"" they are probably not for you."
"These are delicious. I will buy them again and again. They are not for everyone, but if you like wasabi peas, you will love these. The flavoring works great with the taste of almonds."
"My dog is an 11 year old pitbull and has had a sensitive stomach, reoccurring chronic ear infections, and was always licking her paws since she was a puppy. She would get up to walk around and immediately throw up for no reason. This would happen sometimes several times a day. Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more. If your dog has any of the same symptoms my dog had, you should definitely give this food a try. It might not be a fix for every dog but it doesnt hurt to try. It worked for my dog!"
Alessi Fig Vinegar has helped me stick to my strictly vegan program as it makes the required tons of green salads more palatable.  I could not do without it and have actually converted others to using it.
"This is coffee in a pod, so one can not compare it with fresh-ground coffee.  However, for a pod it is very tasty.  Sustainability is just as important as convenience, so this Wolfgang Puck fair-trade organic pod is a great option."
"My family loves these chips.  We bought a huge box of them for my son's bar mitzvah and they were a hit at the party.  The company makes a great product and they ship very quickly.  You can buy small bags or larger quantities.  Order them and you will find that not only isn't one chip enough, one bag isn't enough.  Also the price on Amazon is amazing.  Enjoy!"
"After doing ALOT of research I decided to purchase this Coconut Oil. I'm happy that I did. Thus far, i'm very happy with the purchase. Just a word of advice. If you are going to ingest the Coconut Oil, go to 'Youtube' and do a Search for 'Green Regimen'. This is a Green Smoothie video blog and I put my Coconut Oil in these Smoothies. It's working out GREATLY. Good Luck!!!"
"For years, for all of my waffles and pancakes, I bought this in specialty stores until even they stopped selling it in deference to Classic Fare Belgian Waffle Mix, which, to me, has no flavor.  When I finally found this, I pounced but hated having to buy so much.  But at least I now have it.  Certainly keeps me from having to continue to make my own.  Took a bit more than a week to come because the snowstorm slowed or stopped all commerce.  I do recommend the product because I really like it."
"I ordered regular Calm, and received Calm Plus Calcium.  These are different products. They sent the wrong product, but made good on their advertising by paying for return postage and sending the right product.  My daughter swears by this product's health claims."
I was a bit leary about ordering these chips but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did because I think they are good and you get alot in a bag for it being low in calories. I definitely will order again.
"I make protein shakes for breakfast and peanut butter and banana isy fave!!! However, peanut butter has 190 calories in 2 tbsp's!!!! Pb2 only has about 45 and you only need 1 tbsp to taste it. Sooooo in love with this product!!"
"My standard for a good cup would be Green Mountains Extra Bold Expresso which has been hard to find for around sixty cents or less a serving so I tried this brand after my friend gave me a cup at the office. My batch was a lot weaker. Not sure if the coffee content was less than my friends batch, but I ended up packing my own Expresso coffee in the K-cup which filled the bill.<br /><br />George S.<br />Oceanside NY"
"These really do clean my dogs teeth.  I have used them for years.  Three months ago they cost 20.35 from Amazon, now they are 24.99.  Get real."
"My german shepherd puppy loves this food.  It is very soft, so it mixes with her dry food easily.  The ingredients are fantastic so I know she is eating quality food."
This is a really great ginger powder. Tried other brands and were put off because of the quality? Try this one! You'll love it. It's very potent and hot and that's exactly what ginger lovers like me look for. It's also cheaper than buying at a natural store. You can't beat the potency or quality.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!
"I thought I would try it out-- good price and pretty good reviews, but it's not for me. I crave a nice strong cup of English Breakfast in the morning but this one wasn't to my liking. If brewed too long it had a really bad flavor, but if I brewed it less, not enough or an off-putting flavor. I'm going to try something different."
This coffee is probably the best tasting K cup out there and is at an affordable price. A favorite of the whole family. Does not require sweetener! Highly recommended.
"Out of the several brands of canned refried beans I have tried, this is my least favorite.  They become more palatable if one adds granulated garlic and finely diced onions."
"I agree that the price on this is a bit high, but our dog loves it and still goes crazy whenever it's meal time.  She didn't do well with many of the so-called organic products because they still contain a lot of low quality grains/starches.  Even better, there's less dog waste to clean up too because the product doesn't have useless fillers."
"Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that."
"These are the best wafers I have EVER tasted. I have a sweet tooth and traveled the world (so I have tried many sweets) but nothing compares to these wafers.<br />Also there is one other flavour Amazon does not seem to sell and that is the coconut wafers. Absolutely unbelievable taste and this is an understatement. It has the perfect combination of sweetness, flavor, size and once you start eating it you cannot stop.<br /><br />My favorite are Tiramisu, Lemon, Hazelnut and Coconut. The rest are fantastic too but I have my own I like the best. Italian products - cannot improve on perfect.<br /><br />Watch your waist line though  :P"
"We'd gotten these beans before, and they're excellent quality with fine taste, particularly for the cost per pound.<br /><br />However, for some unknown reason, the most recent order just chews my wife's stomach up. She also says they taste acidic to her. I drink my coffee with milk, so they taste fine to me and and I've had no problems, but I have a mostly cast-iron stomach anyway.<br /><br />So they're sitting on the shelf right now and we're drinking other kinds of coffee that don't give my wife nausea, pain, or heartburn.<br /><br />If you have a sensitive stomach, be careful. If you don't, give 'em a try."
"I adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like MSG and partially-hydrogenated oil. Most importantly, this chowder tastes MOUTH-WATERING GOOD and is bursting with flavor. I use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper, and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes. If you have not already, definitely give it a try."
"O MY GOSH!! this bite size lemon wafer is so tasty.  We enjoy almost everything lemon and these wafers do not disappoint.<br /><br />If we must inject one concern, it is some of the nutrition info & some ingredients(1st three(3) highest content in product)for such a small serving size. SEE BELOW!!!!!!!!  A serious guilty pleasure because a serving is just eight(8)bite size(true to description)wafers.  It is so hard to eat just eight(8)because wafer is tiny and taste GOOD!!.  You decide!!!!!<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving size - 8 cookies, Servings per container: about 4, Calories: 150, Calories from fat 70, Total fat: 8g, Sat fat:6 g, sodium: 30 mg, carbohydrate: 19g, sugar: 9 g, protein: 1 g<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />wheat flour, coconut oil, glucose syrup, sugar, whey powder(milk), dextrose, soy flour, barley malt extract, powered lemon juice 2% in the cream, salt, raising agents(sodium hydrogen carbonate, disodium disphosphate), emulsifier soy lecithins, Bourbon vanilla pods, lemon essential oil, spices.  May contain hazelnute, almonds, and oats.<br /><br />Product of Austria.  No colouring and no preservatives.  Keep cool and dry."
"Mayonnaise is something I usually associate with salads, (read boring rubbish here, in my opinion). However, I have been surprised just how much it is used in Japanese food.<br /><br />Although you can use it with normal salads, I have also enjoyed it very much with takoyaki, (octopus dumplings in a ball shape). It also mixes well with other sauces, such as with Japanese barbeque and so on. Even dipping things like chips, (health food, really!), for a snack works.<br /><br />It is a bit different to other types, but it is very nice with a pleasant and creamy taste to it. Recommended!"
These treats are great for training or if you don't want your dog to have too many calories in their treats. I was buying these at the local pet store and the bags were small and almost as expensive as these 1lb. packs.<br />My dog loves them and will gladly do a trick or two to get her Zuke's.
"You've just located the most healthy, tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today! As a long time user, I can tell you that Amazon offers the best possible price for this item.  I use it for everything:<br /><br />a flavoring for plain rice, as a broth for stir frying (instead of oil), as a base for complicated stews and soups.  If you find it a bit too salty, just add more water.  It has no mysterious chemical additives. It is perfect for heart patients, diabetics, vegans, and folks who just like a fast soup treat."
"I had this on my shelf unopened for several months, picked up on a whim and forgotten until snowstorm food became boring. By itself on lettuce, arugula, green beans, sprinkled on the Rancho Gordo heirloom beans. Makes a simple salad or veggie dish a refreshing experience. Like most quality foods, you do not need as much and you are satisfied after eating them. I am a quality over quantity cook.<br /><br />I will be stocking up!"
"Stash Moroccan mint is my favorite, but this makes a nice change.  IT's got the same mellow mint as the Moroccan mint, but it's also got lime flavor.  It's not like drinking a mojito- but with a fresh slice of lime and some sugar, it's pretty darned good.  I drink it how, but the other reviewer suggested it over ice.  That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot."
"I used My-Kap for the first time today. It works great.  I read where people have asked about being worried that more holes would be punched in the bottom of the k-cup, but you can just place the k-cup back in the holder and gently turn it until it pops back into the original hole from the first use.  They are a bit over priced in my opinion."
"I had gotten Valrhona cocoa powder from a spice shop it is what I was used to from culinary school but I was looking for a better bargain when I was asked to make a wedding cake.  First off it was very difficult to determine whether this is a Dutched cocoa (it is).  When I got the product, I noticed that it is much lighter in color and flavor than the Valrhona.  I still received a lot of complements on my cake but I was disappointed with the light brown color and less rich flavor than the rich deep brown color and flavor of my test run cake made using Valrhona."
"You can read all the reviews for coconut oil, so there's no need to say it again, but this product has improved my life and the lives of my pets many times, many ways. I have tried several brands, and the Nutiva brand is my favorite for flavor, cost and effectivness.  I love it!  I would recommend this product for everyone, as it offers benefits for every type of problem, and for improvements in energy levels, weight loss, better skin and hair, fighting infections....the list is endless. Bravo Nutiva for offering a product that is reasonably priced of the highest quality, and bravo Amazon for offering this superior product at such a good price point."
"If you like dark coffee but don't want bitter, try Tully's French Roast.  This blend will give you a good kick in the morning without ruining the experience with a bad finish."
Have not tried them yet but it looks like an economical way of reusing the little cups. When I have finished my supply of coffee in the cups they came in I will try them.
"CedarHouse liquid smoke is fantastic.  My husband uses this for his jerky and used this liquid smoke and a dehydrator.  The jerky was full of flavor without the need to put the meat in a BBQ smoker."""
These are the exact same licorice mints on sale from other stores at a higher price. There is no accounting for taste -- but if you like these (and I do) this is a good place to buy them.
"This tea is wonderful and soothing, and even more soothing to get it shipped to the house!  I have found it hard to find decaffeinated tea in the grocery store, so this is much easier."
"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you."
"I don't generally crave candy or sweets that often, but if I have a weakness, it's sour lemon-flavored candy.  Here's the problem: I can never find one that satisfies me.<br /><br />Until now!  I have bought all sorts of different brands and types of sour lemon candies, in a bit of a ""search for the Holy Grail"" quest, and I believe I've found it.  These are absolutely great from start to finish.  They are sour all the way through, not like other candies that are coated with sour sugar, which gives you about 15 seconds of sour, and then are super-sweet the rest of the way.<br /><br />Everything about these is great, they're not too big and not too small.  And there's a bonus waiting for you in the middle:  A section of extra-sour lemony goodness that'll make ya pucker a little.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these aren't annoying sour, like Warheads (which again, only are sour on the outside), but they are certainly have more kick than, say, your average lemon drop by Brach's or similar products.<br /><br />I recently got my order of 2 lbs. of these, which will last me a while, but I will certainly be re-ordering these again when I run out.  I've shared these with other lemon-loving friends of mine and they have all agreed on the quality.<br /><br />The only con:  They are slightly pricey, but I feel like I got my money's worth so I would absolutely buy these again."
"Timothy's Midnight Magic coffee is the best K-cup coffee I've had.  It's great for people who drink espresso, and it has a wonderfully rich flavor."
Tried to give these treats to two different dogs.  Both did not like it and would not eat it.
Stephen's Hot Chocolate is the best hot chocolate in the world I won't drink any other hot chocolate. The French Vanilla Is my personal favorite.
"The flavoring is very good, not harsh at all and very easy to drink. However I can go down to my local grocery and get it at $1.50  a bottle, still making it much cheaper for a 12 pack there."
I LOVED these delicious little crunchy treats until I checked the sodium content!<br />I still loved snacking on them BUT I can't for my health's sake.  I gave most of the little delicious treats away away to friends without the sodium caution I have to watch.<br /><br />Oh my....they are good!
"I bought it since it's the only organic green I found. But when I read the label, it says: ""produced in a facility that processes milk, soy and wheat"". My son is allergic to milk and I thought I got something nice for. NO. Have to throw them instead. So be ware, if your kids is allergic to milk or soy or wheat, don't buy this product."
"I stumbled across these on Amazon, and since I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the usual 50 cent K-Cup, I figured I would give these a try - Am I glad I did!!<br /><br />For me at least, one of the issues with the Keurig K-Cup is that most make a cup of coffee that is too weak, especially if you want a larger cup.  This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried ""heavy whipping cream"", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag. When my tea ran out, I started dropping my Fog Lifter cups in these bags, works great.  Both type of bags (the tea ones and the original ones that these K-Cups come in), have a small one way valve to get all the air out.  Super find, super buy"
"After loosing well over 50 lbs on Weight Watchers, and being a cookie lover, I found that snackwells offer a good choice for a cookie craving.  I like to buy them in bulk, and prepackaged so there is no question as to how many I have eaten.  Amazon makes it very easy to buy in bulk, as my grocery store no longer sells them in bulk."
"I did genuinely get a subscription to these bars. you get a full case, and its cheaper than if you were to buy at the grocery store. pretty awesome."
"My wife and I were a bit freaked when Starbucks announced it was no longer being sold in Tassimo (well, you can still buy them at historic prices as their supply must be near zero).  But Maxwell House French Roast more than amply fills the void where Starbuck's House blend used to occupy.  Good, rich, robust, strong cup of coffee!  And it's only costing us about .30/cup compared to Starbuck's original price of about .75/cup"
"I ordered this product so that I could send it on to some soldiers in Afghanistan. The product came on time and as ordered. Great job, and thanks!"
"I guess this is a personal opinion, but I don't particulary like the taste of this. It's one of those ""healthy treats trying to taste good"" type of deal... and this is coming from a health freak. There's better things to try to satisfy a sweet-tooth, like raw organic cashew nut butter mixed with a little raw organic honey!"
"I recently ordered this product and can say that I am extremely pleased with the results. The taste is good, albeit strong; I recommend taking it with a generous portion of water. The creatine in it makes it easy to get your daily requirement and perhaps the most note-able ingredient in this is the endo-thermogens. I noticed that the rate at which I sweated had increased significantly and I was very hungry after my workout (I'm pretty sure that that is a good thing). As for the energy, I am sure that a caffeine product would give me more energy, but I would rather not become dependent upon stimulants such as that. With that in mind, I can say that I have more energy when working out to do more reps. I have seen significant strength gains in the three weeks I have spent using this product; my squat has gone up more than 50 pounds, deadlift about 20, bench about 10, and Preacher Curls an amazing 20 pounds!! Finally, I have noticed better pumps since starting it. Overall, I can say that I would definitely buy this product another time, and for the price you get quite a good amount of it. My only complaint is that on the second day during which I used it, I experienced some minor digestive problems; although it caused me little discomfort."
"I bought these for gifts, so I can't speak on the quality of the tea. However, I will say of the 4 I ordered, 3 of the tins had minor scuff marks or dents/dings, and one had rust on the outside. I kept it because there was no time to order another. I will say, price wise, these are half the price of the best price I could find on a similar item from a retail bath store..."
"I've had this everyday since I received this, I've had it.  It is great with a squeeze of lemon and with cannelini beans and onions.  Great for meze and for cooked meals too.  I had it last night with petite peas, marinara, crushed red peppers, and cavatelli.  A little pecorino romano...mmm...a glass of The Other...that's good food."
"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet."
"I'm not really a bottled water expert, but this stuff was good.  I like the 1.5 Liter size.  It's large, but not uncontrollable.  As far as the water, I found it to be really good, just like any other bottled water."
I always like to keep a box of energy bar in the office. I tried many different brands and larabar is one of the brands I like best. Once I feel like snacking or munching on something I go a grab a energy bar. The taste of this energy is great. The best thing about it is that it's much healthier then lot of the other energy bars.
"There's nothing objectional about this canned coffee.  But there's nothing to enjoy about it.  ""Why Bother"" is the dominant feeling I get if I think about drinking another can."
"My dog is a bit of a jerk. She won't eat a lot of foods, and we've narrowed it down to basically Purnia products. But as she ages, we had to switch to a bit of a healthier choice for food. All of them she turned her head down at. Except for Beneful. I obviously cannot speak to how it takes, but the texture and variety of shapes looks as appealing as dog food can. My dog seems to enjoy it, whereas before she required gravy or some wet food to get her meal down, she can eat this without it. She seems to go to do her business more regularly, and her movements are more solid and seem healthier."
"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***"
"I understand that the product does not guarantee increase in milk production, that is why I can't complain that it did not or helped in any way. It has a very strong herbal fragrance, which my coworkers weren't crazy about. So, if you have a sensitive nose, you will probably have a hard time consuming it."
"Just smelling this bottle makes my toes curl in strawberry-induced euphoric pleasure. &lt;3<br />This is really sugary though, and the strawberry flavor isn't as strong as it's smell. That makes me a sad person.<br /><br />I think Teisseire would sell better if they expanded to a fruit-perfume business. Yes..."
"First, these should be called Mac - Coconut bars, as Coconut is the #2 ingredient and Mango is #3.  Second, lots of people don't like coconut.  I happen to be allergic to it.  Word to Amazon that if you want happy customers to make things like this more prominent.  Thanks."
"I love these Bars, I would actually give them a 5 stars, however the ones I got from Amazon, they were almost half baked, and they stick to your teeth. I am not sure if the batch they send me was bad, or what..The ones I buy from the stores are much better, same company?"
The popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. They are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. Great for dieters. Fits in with a low calorie diet. Definitely would recommend trying at least once.
"Hormel has came up with another shelf stable product. Of course to make it last over a year on the shelf it has to have lots of preservitive ingredients. I sampled one and found they are very salty and tastless. I bought these thinking they would sell in my little store (I sell mostly to senior citizens) being convienant for Senior Citizens to prepare a quick dinner. I was wrong. They are still on the shelf, and I will probably wind up trying to get rid of them at a loss or give away."
"As others reviewers have mentioned, these really stink.  However, the dog seems to like them and the odor is good for training.  Be careful if you bring these to the dog park.  You'll quickly develop a flock of fans!"
"I found this roast a bit bitter and too dark to be Colombian.  It also tasted oily, something that the regular Colombian from Folger's is not.  I was a little disappointed.  Now that the price for this three-pack has doubled since May 2010 it's even less appealing.<br /><br />If I want a bold, dark roast I'll brew some French roast.  If I want a medium dark roast I'll have regular Folger's Colombian and not this blend.<br /><br />Bummer."
"After reading the reviews, I thought I might give this tea a try, and I am glad I did.  I love iced tea, but I have always made it with tea bags.  This is a whole leaf tea and my idea was to brew it in my coffee maker.  I tried it and it worked very well.  Just dop in a filter and a couple of table spoons of tea and presto, perfect tea.  It has a good flavor and color, perfect for iced tea."
"I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day."
"I bought this bag along with another nut milk bag to compare them. This bag busted open at the seams after using it twice. The other bag I purchased was made of thin mesh material. It is still going strong after dozens of uses. This bag might work great for sprouting beans, but I would not recommend it for nut milk."
"I discovered this in a little out-of-the-way store for a very good price and decided to try it.  Soooooo glad that I did!  I love this stuff so much I went back and purchased all that they had ($1.25 a tube!)along with the Napoleon pesto in a tube for the same price.  These products are so handy and very yummy!  For a quick appetizer for unexpected company, I will toast some french bread... smear it with EVOO, the garlic paste, the pesto.  Add some sliced tomatoes and basil leaves if handy and top off with some shredded cheese you have on hand... parmesan, asiago, etc.  Broil for a few minutes.  Takes all of 2 minutes to prepare and another couple to broil and you are done!  I am delighted to find that Amazon carries it as it has become a major staple in my pantry.  I gave one to my sister and she ate half of it before she got home...kept putting it on her finger and eating it.... we DO love our garlic!"
"I've tried many types of pasta for my gluten-free diet.  This is the only spaghetti I've found that tastes and feels like ""normal"" pasta.  Even my non-celiac family members are satisfied with this pasta -- which means I don't have to fix two pots of spaghetti anymore!"
"Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. They taste just like chocolate pudding."
"I was raised on these, and now my kids love them!  We usually just heat them in the microwave.  They are good with soup, spaghetti-o's, dinner, lunch, etc.  I like them cold, sliced on a salad or in a sandwitch with lettuce, tomato, etc.  There is no meat in these, so you don't need to cook them.  They can also be used in most ways hot dogs can, except I don't think these taste that good boiled.  You can grill them, cut them into baked beans, roll them in Pillsbury Crescent rolls and bake, etc.  They are very versatile and a good source of protein that my kids will eat!"
"I really like the flovor of the Gin Gins. I bought some at a discount store just to try, then ordered by bulk from Amazon....sharp, spicy flavor....I am addicted."
I did not like these beans and won't be purchasing them again.  They were bland (even after adding salt and jalapeno peppers).  They also had a weird aftertaste.
"Really smooth and mild. Great for the older folks that come to visit that do not want a ""rough"" cup of coffee."
"I use this product with my french press and moka expresso maker. Both taste amazing. The coffee is smooth with rich flavor, and there is no bitterness at all! I think with good preservation, it can continue to be so. Very nice product."
"Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the ""bad stuff"" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality. Moreover, in cutting out the fat, almost every snack adds artificial sweeteners, fillers, preservatives, or fat substitutes, nearly all of which can be health concerns for consumers. (For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips. Even better, the BBQ flavor is really great in these chips, ensuring that your snack is really satisfying and truly filling your cravings. I love the fact that more salty snack options are appearing on the market, and I hope that Kettle continues its trend of producing simple, healthy, and absolutely tasty products. I guarantee that chip lovers will not be disappointed by this yummy offering..."
"We enjoy our soda stream alot.<br />But the syrups you get from them all have a bitter after taste, which is from using the Splendia.<br />Currently looking for better syrups."
"I am a huge iced coffee/hot coffee/everything coffee fan... but this iced coffee has a very ""fake"" taste. I was disappointed by the lack of real coffee flavor. If you like whipped cream and syrups in your iced coffee, this may work for you. I will stick to the hot Donut Shop flavors!"
"I found that Grandma's Peanut Butter cookies actually taste like peanut butter. I tried another brand and all I tasted was flour and shortening, no peanut flavor at all. My ideal cookie, though, would also contain bits of peanuts in the cookie."
"When perusing the cereal aisle, there are a LOT of choices these days. Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!"
HEIDE INTRODUCED HEIDE GUMMI BEARS IN 1982 . WITHOUT DOUBT THEY ARE THE BEST TASTING JUICE ADDED GUMMI BEAR MADE . HEIDE WAS PURCHASED BY HERSHEY IN 1995 WHO SOLD THEM TO FARLEY SATHER. HEIDE HAD BETTER DISTRIBUTION THEN THAN TODAY. EVERY RETAILER SHOULD HAVE GUMMIS ON THEIR COUNTER AS THEY ARE HEALTHY AND HAVE AMAZING FLAVOR.GOOD FOR KIDS. MANY SMALL BEARS IN EACH PACKAGE-SHARE!
"I didn't care for this blend because for a extra bold, it had a weak taste.  Its hard to explain but a bold and extra bold has a dark, rich taste to it, and this blend was disappointing.  I was just missing that bold flavor.  It tasted like McDonald's coffee that has been sitting for an hour.  The smell was also weak."
"After allowing my Tassimo to collect dust for about three years, I brought it back to life and this coffee selection was my first choice.  It smells great while being brewed and has a great taste.  For me, I add a little ice and milk for iced coffee from time to time and that tastes great as well with this blend.  Maxwell and the Tassimo make a great combination."
I have tried several Molecular Gastronomy Starter kits this one is by far the best out there for the money.
"For those who don't know what meat meal is, it's everything that has protein. e.g. road kill, other peoples dogs and cats that's been euthanize.  I should had payed more attention to the product description.  That's really my fault.  Guess it really is a dog eat dog world when it comes to pet food."
"I saw these in store and picked one up to try, I didn't see any obvious suggested age on the packaging so I thought they would be a healthy finger food for my toddler but they turned out to be really hard (even after soaking in milk for a minute or more they were still hard!). I don't think these are suitable for kids without molars to grind them down OR toddlers who are good at mashing things up with their gums. They are a size of about a small grape so perfect as a chocking hazard. So before buying the twelve pack try one from stores like whole foods."
Something different for a change of pace. Nice texture and taste. Soft and chewy. Great product.
"These taste BETTER than traditional brownies in my opinion, not as heavy and no where near the grease (because there is none!) So quick & easy to make, and my 5-year old loves to help mix the batter.  House smells awesome for hours after baking :)"
"Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini<br />The Appletini has a taste and smell reminiscent of the green apple Jolly Rancher candy, but not as sweet. It tastes almost like a real apple martini, except it isn't dry of course. Out of the three different Crystal Light mocktails I have sampled (Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini), the Appletini is my favorite followed by Margarita, and then Mojito.<br />Each packet is mixed with approximately 2 quarts of water, and it mixes very easily. The liquid pours out in clear green color, and was a perfect complement with my meals or even by itself.<br />Overall: 5/5 stars"
"We have been using Better than Milk Vanilla for some time and we really like the taste.  You can adjust the consistancy by changing the water to milk ratio.  It is always better to mix it up a day before using as the product will totally disolve by then.  Our only complaint is that the product is hard to mix, disolve into the water.  It takes a lot of hard shaking (my wife can't do it) to get the milk to disolve.  You can get it pretty well mixed when making it and finish the next day."
"We bought these because the whole/half Macadamia nut products from Mauna Loa were not available at that time from Amazon.  Adding a little sea salt, they taste just as good, and as a side benefit, the cost is a lot less.  But about the same per ounce as the 24 oz. whole Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macadamias with Sea Salt from Costco, when they have them in stock.)<br /><br />The Amazon ""Product Features"" say these are lightly salted, but that's not true, as you can see from the ""Nutritional Information"" the sodium content is 0 mg."
"I love this ginger ale. Beats any other ginger ale I've ever tried. It has a nice spiciness to it and I appreciate the natural ingredients and that it is sweetened with the perfect amount of cane sugar--not overly sweet at all. Perfect size for 70 cals, what a treat!"
The coffee is strong and not bitter.  Also it is priced right.  I believe some of the revenue from this product goes to help the needy.
"My dog loved them!  They're the perfect size for an 8 lb. (almost) dog. My dog has had his jaw wired, so is unable to eat anything hard or chewy, and these worked out just great for him."
"Product was not available at any local stores,  and cost here was comparable to buying local.  Extremely happy to find one of my favorite products."
"It is great to be able to have this hot chocolate delivered right to my door. It is not available in our local food stores in the barrel size. It is ""fat free"" and also has lower sugar content, ideal for diabetics."
This product is just what my chrildren and their friends wanted. I can assure you that it won't last long. I'm sure that I will be ordering again.
"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again."
"Our 5½ year old Carolina Dog (if you don't know what they are - Google them - they're fascinating!) absolutely loves these.  He's very polite, never whining or insisting for ""just one more"" of anything - until now.  From the first one, he almost refused to just eat one.  They're small, handy, and almost smell good enough to eat for humans (if you like things like Hickory Farms smoked sausage).  And the ingredients are excellent - not just a bunch of grain fillers.  We won't feed our dog (or previous dogs) ""junk"" snacks.  Will we get these again?  You bet!  I've never seen any of our dogs go for a ""treat"" like ours has with these.  Our reviews only get 5 stars if they're truly superior - and this easily rates the full 5."
"Love the taste, but a 'squeeze' is hard to measure. A quick squeeze, a full squeeze, a short squeeze, a long squeeze?<br /><br />I bought MiO to flavor the occasional water bottle while hiking. I'm glad I tried it at home first. The directions state one 'squeeze' ( ½ teaspoon) per 8 oz. Even if you can perfect your ½ teaspoon squeeze (or carry a ½ teaspoon with you), another size glass or bottle adds difficulty. I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others. For my hiking and other more solitary uses, I'll go with the longer shelf life of individual serving powdered mixes for variety."
"This gum has an interesting, vibrant peppermint flavor. I liked it as it wasn't overpowering, but it was still nicely minty. It also had a nice ""mouth feel"" not being too hard to too soft.<br /><br />I didn't notice anything out of the ginseng part. But then again, I chew quite a bit of peppermint gum, so I got it for the sugar-free peppermint part, not the ginseng part.<br /><br />Comes in a nice package that will protect the gum, but still has a slightly modern look. One quibble- it comes in packs of nine, not a dozen as is more common.<br /><br />Chewing sugar-free gum between and after meals is very good for dental hygiene.  Not as good as brushing, sure, but it's a handy way to help keep your teeth and breath fresh."
"Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with ¾ tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house."
"Excelent tasting, with little sugar.<br /><br />I am a diet control diabetic and I find this bar<br /><br />an excelent snack. Comes in many flavors..."
"Excellent product, price, ease of ordering and speed of delivery (Super Saver Shipping).  I've ordered this many times and will continue to do so."
This Is the Best sauce ever .  Use it alot over the holidays.  My family loved it. Please don't run out of this sauce.
"I love K-Cups coffee.  They are easy and one always has a FRESH cup of coffee in less than a minute.  However, coffee this way can be quite expensive.  I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone."
"I rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta, but every once in a while, I eat some of this as a treat.  Almost as good as the pastas that I ate while in Italy!  Just make sure you don't over cook."
"This is not our regular formula, but I do purchase this from time to time, when I have coupons. We had such a bad experience with the ""Gentle"" version of this formula that I was skeptical to try this. But I was very pleasantly surprised by this ""Protect"" version. No constipation, no throwing up, no spitting the bottle out - just lots of good BMs, happy tummies, and empty bottles. I would definitely recommend this, especially since it has the probiotics in it."
"I brought this as a gift, and they could not stop complimenting on it. Large quanity, Large variety, and most importantly Great tasting."
"I read some glowing reviews on blogs of these bars and decided to try this one as it was considered the ""best tasting"" by many.<br /><br />The outer chocolatre itself is good, but the ""caramel truffle"" had a quite unpleasant taste that I did not like at all. After two bites it ended in the garbage. Oh well...<br /><br />For now I'll stick to Lindt 85% Cacao bars which are cheap and meet my needs of a very low sugar chocolate treat."
"Stash Green Chai tea is very tasty, especially when it's mixed with some milk and honey.  Even better, it has the perfect amount of caffeine for me--just enough to wake me up without making me sweaty and jittery like coffee does.<br /><br />The individually-wrapped, foil-packaged tea bags are convenient, even if that much packaging does seem like overkill.  The packaging allows me to take a couple of tea bags with me wherever I go, just in case I get stuck in a boring meeting with no other beverage options except for nasty office coffee or plain hot water. . . Yes, I'm too cheap to go to Starbucks!"
I love this tea!  My favorite part is that the tea bags are NOT individually wrapped and don't have a string.  I use this tea in my Iced Tea Maker (by Mr Coffee) and it works perfectly because I don't have to unwrap all the bags.
"I first found these crackers at a Jason's Deli restaurant, and have been searching for them online.  They are wonderful tasting crackers.  I signed up for the subscribe and save and look forward to receiving them every other month."
"I bought this brand because my favorite brand was sold out and I thought I would try something new.  What a mistake.  This ""peanut butter"" is not entirely peanuts!  Its peanuts mixed with oil.  So what if its Organic.  If I want Organic peanut butter, I want it made out of peanuts.  I got crunchy, because I love the nuts in crunchy peanut butter.  But this is really smooth, slightly peanut flavored oil with a few nuts mixed in.<br />Dont waste your money.  This stuff is gross!  Gross!  Gross!  I will never purchase it again."
"I like my ginger with a nice strong flavor, which these consistently have.  But...the quality is just too sugary for me.  It is like eating a sugar cube. I have had others bought online that are much less crumbly in the mouth and don't have a sugary, gritty feel.  Try others before this one.  my opinion only; everyone has a preference."
"I'm reviewing the Organic Chicken and Egg Noodles soup.  I'm puzzled by the reviews that rave about the soup -- the only thing I can think of is that perhaps they are reviewing different kinds.  This particular soup is not worth the money.  You will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken.  The egg noodles are ""okay.""  You'll get lots of water and celery, so if you like that, then this is for you.  The flavor is good, but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store.  I'd say save your money."
"These Energy Plus candies are really tasty.  They taste like a hard caramel which eventually gives way to a soft honey center.  They have a modest amount of vitamins in each drop: 33% of your daily recommended value of two of your B vitamins and also C.  I don't notice any vitamin flavor, which is nice.<br /><br />The sugar content is pretty moderate (5 gm), mostly because you are spending a long time sucking on a small portion.<br /><br />I enjoy having these around during my work day.  I find that small hard candies are a nice little treat and energy boost throughout the day (for long days doing computer work, in my case).<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Very tasty.<br />- Moderate sugar and calories (10 minutes of enjoyment for 5 gm sugar and 20 calories).<br />- B vitamins give me an energy boost.<br />- Natural ingredients:  Sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, butter, natural flavors, B + C vitamins.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- The gooey center is a personal preference.. Sometimes I wish these were solid so they would last longer and not be quite so sweet at the end."
"I think Kirkland is better than even Splenda! I can't think of anything else to describe it any better! Thank you!  Carol H, Seattle"
"Weight Watchers has recently changed its Blueberry Muffin.  It now is worth only 4 pts. but tastes horrible.  In the picture that I ordered from , it showed boxes that were marked as being worth 5 pts.--those were the good ones.  When my package arrived, it was the ones that were only worth 4 pts.  I threw them in the trash!!! (all six boxes of them).  Sounds like false advertising to me."
"This is the best flavored tea I have tasted.  It is so smooth like drinking hot chocolate, because it is decafinated I use a regular tea bag with it and sweet and low.  I originally bought this product at Target but they no longer carry it nor do any of the supermarkets in my area."
Makes the best-tasting meatballs....just like my Grandmother made!  So easy and foolproof.  They always make a hit when I serve them.....highly recommend them!
"Purchased 50 pack (with a subscription only $17+ dollars)I have a six month renewal of same, can't beat the price ($10 at Walmart for 18) we also have PRIME shipping which is free and 2 day delivery."
"I added it to stir fry veggies but found no difference in taste. What a waste of bucks! I will never try it again, that's for sure."
"These are great cookies, that go great with coffee, tea, or hot cocoa. Very light and crispy, and with a sweet cinnamon taste."
I wish I had come to the Amazon site before purchasing this product at my local Wegman's. The 'Product Of China' was printed so small it was easy to overlook. I am a little shocked that Wegman's (a local chain store known for quality) was selling these 'treats' in a big display. The half open package is going in the trash and unopened bag is going back to Wegman's for a refund and a piece of my mind.
"Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point. What is important is how fresh the coffee is. I found that each cup had the same freshness so that's a nod to consistency. As for my own personal taste preferences, I drank Folgers Classic Roast for years and since that isn't available in K cup, I've been drinking the Caribou Coffee blend as a replacement. It tastes fine to me and the caffeine keeps me going all day.  I haven't had any problems with using the Caribou Coffee K cup either. When company comes, this is one coffee I don't share :)"
"Unlike every other roasted cashews I've seen, these have exactly two ingredients:  cashews and sea salt.  No oils at all.  They taste fantastic, without any of that slightly oily finish you get on ones roasted in oil"
"I bought this as a gift for a friend. She loved it especially because she loves the original Hershey's kisses. It just looks like a nice small gift and can combines well with anything. Personally, I would rather not receive this gift as it's pretty hard to eat. Either you have to saw at it (which makes a mess) or you just gnaw on it (not attractive). If there's a practical way to consume this piece of chocolate I have not found it."
"I was looking for a healthy, great tasting snack / protein bar low in sugar - this is it.  I eat 5-6 small meals per day and I occasionally substitute one of these bars for a mid-morning snack or after a workout when it's more convenient than a protein shake.  I purchased 3 boxes after the initial sample and after a few months I'm still not tired of the flavor.  My only recommendation is that the bar should be bigger; it's only 40g in total containing 7G protein, 4g sugar, 0G cholesterol and 5G of fiber."
One of my two cats LOVES this and gobbles it down.  The other only likes fancy feast unfortunately.  I love the ingredients and the smell.  It looks just like a can of chicken that any human could eat!  The label says it all--feeding your cat weruva can increase your cat's lives from nine to ten.  Thank you weruva and amazon for providing this fabulous cat food at affordable prices.  Puuurrs!
my kids were thrilled to have this kind of treat gluten free and tasty.  It has become a favorite in our family.3
"Great bars, delicious, easy to order and would def. order again. Light bar and better nutrition than others, low fat."
A+  I bought this product to use with my new 4 0z. Popcorn machine.  The flavor is absolutely delicious!  I agree with the other reviews that I've read...it tasted just like theater popcorn!  There were a few old maids left that didn't pop but I will buy more when my supply runs out.
"I didn't order it from amazon but it is in a local sushi bar i go to. It is highly carbonated and great tasting, not only that, its fun to open and drinking it is kind of a game, enjoy!"
This cappuccino tastes as good as any I have ever bought from a coffee shop.  I love the french vanilla.
"We love this balsamic. Clearly well aged, it has residual flavors of port and oak. Definitely a nice top to a quick chop salad, or lightly glazed on a steak with a pungent blue (like Bayley Hazen or Stilton)."
"I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead."
"While this was brewing, I was excited.  It smelled like a bonafide donut shop in my kitchen.  Was I really going to be able to drink a chocolate donut without the calories?  Not so much.  It has a distinct chemical taste to it that even creamer and sugar cannot fix.  I actually gave it away to a friend that likes it for some unknown reason."
"My wife likes flavored coffee and this is, by far, her favorite. Great taste. Medium brew. Excellent value too. We order this brew regularly. Guests enjoy this coffee as wel."
":: English Toffee Flavored Liquid Stevia ::<br /><br />Amazing how intensely rich this is!<br /><br />It totally tastes like sweet english toffee. How thay accomplish so much flavor in these zero cal little droplets, that's a voodoo mystery to me. My one complaint is that they don't give any hints of their tricks to get the english toffee flavor. I know that stevia is already magic in itself for its sweetness power, but wondered about how they managed to get the strong english toffee swing in there. On package label, all they have to say, basically, is ""Natuarl flavors"". Unfortunately staying more secretive than I'd have preferred. But I can forgive them that one decision. Since overall: this stuff is a great treat, while leaving your conscience clean on matters of substances in the body.<br /><br />Ultimate Summertime Cappuccino:<br /><br />  - Good quality roast coffee, chilled<br />  - Soy milk (frothed, if frother handy)<br />  - Liquid stevia. English toffee flavor for total indulgence!<br />  - Serve over ice"
"I have no idea whether this aids your digestion in any way or not.  I doubt it, actually.  But this is a tasty, high energy snack.  It's easy to eat too much, actually, due to the great mixture of flavors.  Would be great for hiking and camping.<br /><br />Mine seemed fresh, was shipped promptly, and arrived in good condition."
This product was just fine - as advertised. Arrived as promised. We eat a lot of pocorn but this will last for a long time. Pops up good!!
"I've gotten the 3 pack a couple times now, going on my 3rd.  It's pretty good coffee.  Each bag so far has been very fresh and they smell like pure bliss as almost chocolatey aromas hit your nose when you open the bags.  Each bag is very consistent too which is hard to find with coffee sometimes."
"a friend recommended me to this item, he bought the same item at Gelson's, but since the closest Gelson's a bit<br />of a stretch i just decided to order here on Amazon, i've just become accustom to ordering HERE, it's so easy and<br />simple to do, but OK, back to , Dave's Pasta Sauce, i ordered 3 different version's of Dave's, sauce's, so far the very<br />first one i opened the Garlic and Sweet Basil, was just incredible,  obviously my friend steered me Right, i can't wait<br />to jump into the other 2 sauces i have, highly recommended,...don't need to add anything, it's that simple !!!!!!!"
"Have bought this from the folks who prepare it and I must say, this is the absolute best item I have ever tasted. They make this at a farm in Benson, AZ and it tastes like heaven. Highly recommend it for everything...I tend to slice up apples and dip them. Have tried it on toast as well."
"I've been looking for a decent instant coffee, and since I like Greek coffee, decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.  I normally take my coffee black, but this doesn't taste quite right to me without a little sugar."
"This stevia sweetened, natural soda has a really great crisp, clean flavor and is very refreshing because it's not too sweet.  But it loses fizz way too quickly.  If you leave it in the opened can longer than about an hour, it goes competely flat.  It also loses fizz quickly when poured warm over ice.  Please fix the fizz issue, Blue Sky, and we'll buy more."
"I have been using this curry paste for several years now, and it makes a great dish. Although it doesn't beat eating Indian out, its the best paste I have used for at home dishes. Even though this is a ""hot"" paste, I would consider it mild."
"I hate drinking my coffee black.  These white chocolate mocha singles are easy to keep in my desk at work, they don't need refrigerated unless opened.  I use 1/2 of a tub to a cup of coffee, any more and it's too sweet for me. Until I got the combination right (1/2 tub, 1 packet of Splenda), I didn't care for these. After experimenting some, they are pretty good.  I hope these eventually are offered with dark chocolate instead of white. The more chocolately flavor, the better!"
"I am not the typical sunflower seed eater but recently a friend of mine re-introduced me to them. I love everything hot and spicy but these are impossible to find in the stores so I ordered from Amazon. OMG....these are great!! I also like the Ranch but they are a bit saltier than these so I have to eat them in moderation. These are the perfect little ""snack"" for when you are sitting in front of the tv and don't want the carbs and calories from eating popcorn with butter. With a case of 12, I will be stocked up for a while!!"
"One of my favorites ... Similar to ""Donut Shop Original"".<br /><br />Here is list of my favorites starting with the boldest/strongest.<br /><br />Emeril's Easy Bold<br />Newman's Own<br />This one Fair Trade Colombian Select<br />Donut Shop Original<br />Nantucket<br />Daybreak from Caribou"
"I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them."
"I first tried these cookies while visiting family in Panama.  They were available at the local grocery stores.  When I came back to the U.S. I couldn't find them locally but thank goodness for AMZAZON, I found them and at an affordable price.  I order a carton of eight packages and share them with friends.  They are a delightfully light and fresh tasting treat that soon become nearly addictive.  I have tried some of Loacker's other flavors but the lemon is my all time favorite.  I am tempted to subscribe to them!!"
"Stay away from this product if you want to control your calorie intake, by taking supposedly healthier dried vegetable chips. Found the nutrition fact -- 450 calories per oz. It triples what you would find in other dried veggie chips."
"My daughter loved these. I committed to not giving her wheat in the first year, that was hard to do! At the time I was buying these there were no wheat products in the ingredients. (be aware that companies change their recipes all the time. If no wheat is your goal too be sure to double check the ingredients before purchase) These little puffs are great melt in baby mouth travel food. And the dog liked them, so I rarely ever found them on the floor. :D"
Ahhhhh It tastes so good. I'll definately have to order some more once I run out it's so good. Buffalo Bills knows how to make jerky for sure
"I've been using a Senseo coffee maker for 2 years. Last year, fewer of my local stores have carried any Senseo coffee pods. Fortunatly, I am able to purchase my dark roast and decaf on Amazon through automated shipping. Once a month I get my delicous dark roast and every 3 months I get my decaf. I save time and money and don't have to worry if the supermarkets or gourmet shops even have have my Senseo in stock."
Wonderful raisons!  Thanks!  Very plump and fresh - all 15 lbs. - much better than the grocery.  Will order again next year.
"My 6 mo. old large breed puppy really likes these. Its definitely better than a regular rawhide and apparently safer for puppies too. So better value, lasts longer, and safer for your dog. Worth buying."
I am very happy with my purchase of this product. It was a gift for a friend who loves plants.. He absolutely loved it! It arrived in great condition and everything has been smooth sailing.
"I used to not like Coconut water.  When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.  Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.  If I could afford it, I would only need this one drink for life and I'd be happy."
It took my 3 minature dachshunds about 5 minutes to eat the bone.  I was hoping that the bone would be more of a challenge to eat!
"This was my first time rolling fondant, and I had no trouble using this product.  Some that I've tasted in the past might as well have been made from glue, but this one had a pretty decent (though sugary, obviously) taste.  After a small amount of kneading it rolled out as smoothly as I could have hoped and covered my cake beautifully."
yummy yummy yummy in my tummy yummy! this stuff is so awesome its making me sing dora and i hate dora! it a perfect size with perfect taste
"Muffins with out the mess! Easy portable on the go snack!Kids love them,and adults do too! Quaker is a brand you can trust."
Rockstar Zero is great for when you need an extra boost without the jitters and the sugar. Purchasing a case of Rockstar through Amazon saved me time and money. Rockstar Zero is hard to find and is also expensive. This is the best deal by far.
"Some very delicious french roast in these here green bags. In combination with my Aeropress I couldn't be happier. Every shipment I have received of these beans has been fresh, aromatic, and oily. Nothing but praise for this consistently delicious bean. If you are hunting around for a nice organic roast, you could do a lot worse than diving into a bag of Jeremiah's Pick French Roast."
I mixed these with plain yogurt and frozen blueberries for my boston terrier's kong and he LOVED it. He kept bringing it to me wanting it refilled. Love that they are wheat free as we think he might be allergic or at least sensitive to wheat.
"I am very sorry to say this tasted to me the way I imagine ""rear end"" would taste. I tried refrigerating them to make it more palatable. For some reason there was a very strong bran-like taste as the most dominant flavor, with sweet and chocolate as the secondary and tertiary flavors in that order. I assume it was from the brown rice. I agree with another reviewer that they are very sweet, though since I cooked them in mini cupcake form it was not a significant problem for me. I tried for several weeks (including refrigerating and freezing) to try and finish them without wasting them, but I finally gave up. I was so worried I gave away my other untried products (carrot cake mix etc.) from this company. I didn't dare try the rest, as brown rice was listed as a primary ingredient again."
"I've been purchasing Bear Naked Fruit and Nut Granola for a few years now. I've tried sooo many different kinds, including making my own. I would recommend this to ANYONE who appreciates good granola and wants a good quality product. It's very filling and goes great with milk or sprinkled on top of yogurt. I've even sprinkled it over my pancakes while they're cooking. The pecans and almonds in it are my favorite!"
What can I say.  Its dog food and the dog cobbles it up. It is easy to order and the super saving shipping is great.
"arrived in excellent condition, on time,and is a rather exotic addition to my pantry.  will use in lemonade, lemon based baked goods."
"As a previous reviewer has stated this product is one of the only products that is not competitively priced on Amazon as compared to store prices. The item sells for $22.50 in my nearby Walmart which comes to $135 which is much cheaper than what Amazon is currently selling for.<br />However, i have found that diapers are a good deal on Amazon especially because TX charges sales tax on them.<br /><br />- Updated 10/7/2010<br />Price of the item has come down to approx $21/can making this a great deal to buy from Amazon. I have already ordered it twice and the formula has reached me undamaged and promptly(the cans comes nicely packed together in plastic and cardboard). We have twins so i will be ordering every other week if the price remains competitive."
The most awesome cookies on the planet. We need a treat that is not full of sugar and Nanas fits the bill for us.
"Regretfully the Crazy Critter ""Fox"" lost the fight against the ultimate shredder ... my Doberman.  He managed to grind through the material with his back teeth (like they do with a bone) and removed the squeekers from the head and tail.  Lets see if the Raccoon puts up a better fight.  :-)"
If you want a new cracker or a change from bread this has a great taste. Great price online for this product.
These are the BEST!!! Linzer Cookies I've ever had!...so delicious that Scotts Cakes has a lifetime customer here!........so fresh and tasty that I could not stop eating them...fresh ingredients and excellent price and the Super Fast Shipping makes them a Winner!.......5 Stars definitely.
"Hard to find in stores, although our Target usually has it.  We feel it tastes like movie popcorn - so mysterious.  A cereal everyone likes, without gallons of sugar.  Tasty!"
"Makes a reasonably good cup of coffee.Lacks the smoothness of some brands, but those who like a strong brew may like this"
"Everyone knows what a Tic Tac is, but let me tell you something; if you like orange tic tac's, you're going to LOVE wild cherry tic tacs!  Very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour.  Do yourself a favor and try some."
This cereal is sooo good and I love that Natures Path makes ALL their products with non-GMO's unlike other so-called organic brands.  Thank you!
"Really liked the 10 flavor sour mix from Jelly Belly, but couldn't seem to find them locally anymore.  Now they are selling the sour mix as a 5 flavor mix.  Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together."
"I was considering a purchase to try this out after reading so many positive reviews and reading that it is also dairy and soy free, HOWEVER, I called my local Whole Foods to see if they carried this and was told they did and it was $5.69 per loaf.  This - - with S&H - - comes to $7.70 per loaf.  NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ!<br /><br />WF also told me they carry Udi's Hamburger buns in a 4-pak for $4.69 per pk, again MUCH cheaper than AMZ's offerings.<br />NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ!<br /><br />Why is it that any time there is a special need, it is used to justify outrageous prices, even on items thar are cheaper to make/produce than the regular ones - - like Tuna with just tuna, water or oil and salt @ $2.++ or more per can, as opposed to the nonsense with vegetable broth, etc. for a dollar or less per can?<br /><br />If we refuse to buy their products at these outrageous prices and let these venture niche products sit on the shelf, they might reconsider their outrageous prices.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049OQJXA"">Udi's Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread (1 Case)</a><br /><br />(Are you listening AMZ????)"
"I have a  background in Alternative Medicine and also as a Personal Trainer. Drinking plenty of good quality water is vital to our health and I make sure I drink a minimum of 2 quarts of water a day.<br /><br />Over the last several months since I first met Mr Trivedi, I have been drinking from 1 -4 bottles of Trivedi Water every day. I am delighted that it has become available on Amazon and can now be delivered directly to my door!<br /><br />The things I have noticed are remarkable.<br />It has helped with my digestion. My tummy feels lighter. When I have applied it to small cuts on my fingers or minor abrasions it has healed them up in a day or 2. When I have poured it onto my plants they seem to come back to life with more vigor. Drinking it on a daily basis I feel fantastic and ""energized"" and if ever I am fatigued it seems to take stress and fatigue out of my system. I've applied it to my eyes a couple of times when they felt irritated and within minutes the irritation and redness began disappearing.<br /><br />I also notice that it seems to hydrate my body more so than any other water and I drink a lot of good quality 8.5 - 9.5 pH alkaline water. This water is wonderful.<br />Start drinking some and see for yourself!"
Got this for my sister for her birthday. She loved it! It is especially good with a soft cheese and bread.
Vermints are my new favorite treat.  This flavor has a moderate to strong cinnamin flavor but isn't overly hot - like an altoid.  Love that they are all natural and made with organic sugar!
"My dog is picky. We have never been able to train with treats, because she just wasn't that into them. We picked up Zuke's and can't get over how crazy she is for them.<br />They have great natural ingredients, including Vitamins, Omegas and Flax. No artificial colors, flavors or by products. They do have chicken but are made in the USA. I was surprised how many dog chicken treats are made in China."
Soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one...it is one of the best meat/veg dinners we have found!
"This is a very tasty cereal, but I find it a bit too sweet for my liking. The Os look similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52"">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>, but they taste more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPOEF8"">Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch</a>. In terms of sugar content Crunchy Nut is comparable to Honey Nut Cheerios (about 10 g each) so if you like that amount of sugar in your cereal then the choice between these two will come down to taste. The little pieces of nuts that are embedded in each O are hardly noticeable, both visually and in terms of the overall taste. It turns out that these are technically speaking not really nuts, but rather peanuts. They mostly have an effect in terms of the overall flavor - the combination of corn/oats and peanut pieces is probably responsible for the peanut-buttery taste. The Os are indeed very crunchy, and they are among the crunchiest cereals that I have ever tried. They don't lose this crunchiness easily even after a minute or two of soaking in milk. Crunchy Nut Os also make a very tasty and convenient snack. I have also tried them with blueberries and the fruity flavor comes as a nice contrast to all the sugariness of this cereal. Overall, this is a very nice cereal but it's nothing spectacular."
this was perfect for our road trips! not wanting to stop for snacks alot just pick up some jerky! yum!
"Our family LOVES this take on a diet tea...esp. because my husband is borderline diabetic and needs to change his drink preferences. This product is increasingly hard to find, so we hope that the Snapple people will offer it as a regular flavor."
"I would love to buy in bulk but I need to know what flavors are in a mixed pack; more specifically whether it contains both caffeinated and non-caffeinated.  I have already experimented and found that caffeinated isn't going to work for me, so I don't want to risk buying a 24 pack with a dozen caffeinated gels. I don't see this information in the copy."
"Kraft Mac and Cheese has always been my go-to quick mac and cheese. Though there may be some subtle taste difference between this and the regular, I can't taste it and neither could my husband. There is only 1/2 serving of veggies per cup, but getting an extra half serving of veggies in your mac and cheese isn't such a bad deal, really (and if you mix in some peas or green beans, then you've got yourself a bit of a meal). (I think the real question here is if we should wonder if the federal regulations for saying something has a serving of vegetables/fruit have become too lax lately.)<br /><br />I'd definitely buy it again. I'm currently pregnant, so any place I can sneak in an extra vegetable serving (especially since so many normal foods don't appeal to me now) is good. And while I don't think this is the way to get your kids to eat their veggies, again it's not a bad way to get some extra in there."
"Decaf teas in American are very weak and just do not brew up well.  This Yorkshire tea is the one I love to bring back home each time I am in the British Isles.  I was delighted to discover I could order them also from Amazon.  They've made a great gift to my older Irish relatives who love a strong cup of tea, but can not handle the caffeine anymore."
"I know this is supposed to be for men with prostate problems, but the bloke at the health store recommended I try these on my Husky mix to minimize shedding and give her a glossy coat. We've used 2 bottles so far and her coat gets better and better. I spear one in the mornings and squeeze the contents into her food. It has a pleasant flavor and she doesn't seem to mind it in the least. She saw the vet today who said this is the best her coat has ever looked. Highly recommend. Wonder if it will do anything for my hair?:)"
"I like that this is vegan but it really is rather bland. But no worries. I add some mushrooms, some chopped peppers, and my fave hot sauce and it is wonderfully delicious. There is much you can do with this as your base. Nothing is as comforting as a bowl of hot ramen soup. I have tried the miso one too and it is also pretty awesome."
I have always loved this product. It taste great but the shipping cost is too expensive. It is alot cheaper going to the store and buying it that way you wont have to pay for shipping.
"There are lots of postings out there stating that so called ""Cactus Honey"" is not honey form the bees but actually guave juice which is pretty disappointing and deceptive. Would appreciate someone can clarify this."
"I first bought another brand of coconut butter and found it to my liking in every way. Hoping that all brands will not be so different from each other, I tried Kevala, and was disappointed to find its texture too coarse and dry, as if dried juiced out coconut meat was processed by blender. It does not have the silkiness and softness of coconut flesh as in the other brand. So much for trying another brand; I will stick to the first one I bought."
"I bought 3 of there nut milk bags and and the seems all tore after one use, they sent out 2 replacements (when i bought 3) and they did the same thing. Bad customer service.<br />They do not support there products."
"These taste great are are nicely packaged. They made perfect Christmas gifts and would be a great gift for any occasion. I am not a big fan of dark chocolate, but these are not bitter at all. The chocolate goes perfect with the liquor filling."
This soda is AMAZING!!!!! you have got to get your hands on it! It tastes like real candy (sweatarts) and once you take one sip you have to drink the entire bottle! Then you have to come back to Amazon and order more!!!!! Loved it!
"I have yet to find a superior dry cat food. I prefer to feed my cat a raw diet, but sometimes it isn't possible. An apartment doesn't have a place for an extra freezer so unfortunately a raw diet isn't feasible. This food is the closest to a raw diet you can get in a dry kibble. NO GRAIN and all meat proteins, exactly how cats want it. And like other reviewers commented, cats LOVE it. My cat always runs hopefully to his CORE storage bin when I start to open it and cries and begs until it is on his dish. My cat's coat is glossy, thick, healthy and barely sheds. His eyes are clear and bright. He has tons of energy and every year his vet is impressed with how healthy he is. No digestive problems, and no kidney problems that are so common in cats fed grain cat food.<br />I strongly recommend this cat food!"
The product arrived on time and was in good shape. No melted chocolate. Saved me some money and gave me the best candy on the block for Halloween.
"If ou don't have the patience or care how your tea tastes, these capsules will work fine.  However, you can get the same effect by putting a tea bag in your Keurig.  PG Tips bags make a nice stout cup even in a Keurig.  Me?  I favor boiling water and steeping for five minutes in a pot.  Wife and son are fine with the Keurig brew."
"First the product came with a peculiar oder, like a perfume. It did have a sweetning effect on my drinks. However, after about a week, the packets began to harden, perhaps from absorbing moisture. Now the product is worthless as I cannot even get it out of the paper packages."
"My dogs (English Springer Spaniels) get a chew every morning after their breakfast. But I always make sure that it is a specific kind of chew and CET Chews meet that requirement.  The dogs like the taste and eagerly attack this chew while cleaning their teeth in the same mode.<br />The chews I purchased are a nice size for medium to large dogs and if you are looking for a good dental chew, then this product comes highly recommended.<br />I will surely purchase this again for my dogs."
"I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach."
"Soda is one of my big weaknesses.  But lately I've been on a diet and realized that I had to cut out all the sweet stuff, including soda.  I've always had a hard time finding a substitute drink that satisfied me (I hate diet sodas and drinks), until I came across the superfruit punch.  I like how it is mildly sweet, had less calories than a regular soda and is very refreshing.  I also like how this drink does not make me feel more thirsty.  It's a great option for people looking for a bit of sweetness in their lives, without the guilt of soda."
I used to purchase my Blacken seasoning at a high end<br />grocer... it was pretty expensive. Sadly he stopped<br />carrying it.. Looking in regular retailers I was dissapointed<br />in the size and price and source of similar products. When<br />I saw Amazon was carrying this large quantity for a reasonable<br />price I was thrilled...<br />I used it oonce... the flavot is horrible... don't waste your<br />money..
"I recently purchased a 6 pack of Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb Seasoning Blend and couldn't be happier!  I tried this product when I saw it new in the store and loved it - but it has become harder to find since so many competitors are offering similar products to the Mrs. Dash line now.  This particular blend is my favorite - I don't need to keep onions in the pantry any more since the onion flavor is just what I like.  The price was a little better than the usual price in the store, and now I don't have to worry about not being able to find it - I'm so glad I found this offer on Amazon!"
I would not purchase this coffee again. Although drinkable- it needs a lot of creamer to drown out the bitterness.
If you like a dark bold flavor this is the one for you.  Starbucks Sumatra coffee is a deep rich flavor that bold coffee drinkers will love.
I can be picky about what water I drink and Smart Water happens to be one brand that I really enjoy. This price is pretty good for what you get.
I love cheesecake. It has always been one of my favorite indulgences. My favorite out of these has got to be Snickerdoodle. They are fast and easy and delicious.
My husband makes salsa from these tomatoes.  The fire roasted specs add alot to the flavor.  I've bought Muir Glen for years and never had a problem.  Cases of cans from Amazon tend to arrive with at least a few dented though.
I was thrilled to get this product. I had looked in several grocery stores with no success. It is a great low fat/low carb dressing. It tastes great as well. I appreciate having Amazon where I can usually find what I am looking for.
"Great product for those of us who like pies and thought they would never be able to eat them again!  This product makes a great flaky crust.  Measure the ingredients carefully to make sure you are not adding too much butter, etc.  Add the water a little at a time.  The crusts can be difficult to roll out if they are too wet.  I usually make all four crusts at one time and freeze the extras.  I've found that the crusts are better when baked before adding the pie filling.  I honestly don't think that anyone would be able to tell that this is not a traditional pie crust."
"I'm sure they were fine, my grand-nephew to whom I sent them for Xmas didn't bother to let me know if they arrived or not, but I am sure they were fine.  Thank you.  I know they were delivered in a timely manner. Happy New Year."
"Love these in salad, smoky flavor replaces high fat bacon bits and the texture has replaced the raisins I used before choosing to cut back calories.  The regular ones are good too, but my favorites are the smoked."
"I was excited to purchase BPA free canned beans from a reputable company, Eden Foods, who I must admit I think I have a brand preference towards, because I appreciate the effort they put into setting high standards for their products and finding growers who can provide them with that. While I do want to eventually switch to using dried beans because I think that its less packaging and better price versus the canned, I am busy sometimes and find that to have some canned beans in the pantry on stock has been very helpful. The kidney beans in the can are nice big beans, and taste delicious.<br /><br />Kidney beans are great cold out of the can in salads with kale, red onion, avocado, and sprouts and I love them in soups! (But shortly before the soup is ready as you dont want them to get too mushy) I was happy about my purchase and will continue to buy Eden Kidney Beans, whether it be canned or dried."
"This soup made me physically ill. Not a pleasant texture or taste. Actually, it was so bad that I haven't been able to look at split pea soup the same way ever since. I'm not using hyperbole, I don't think I'll ever be able to eat split pea soup again."
"This is great food for dogs! My dogs usually weren't too enthusiastic about dry food, but they eat this stuff without any problems. I love that it is very healthy for them and grain-free with no undesirable ingredients. I supplement their food with salmon oil, so I'm happy to feed them this product, which has a reduced amount of fat. I also mix this dry food with other premium dry food or premium can food sometimes. I really enjoy providing my dogs with a variety of highly-palatable food that is good for them. One of my dogs had skin/allergy problems, and the healthy diet with reduced grains and increased omega oils has completely healed her skin and made her coat softer. This Wellness CORE Grain-free Dry Dog Food, Reduced Fat Recipe, is the one premium dry dog food that I mix with everything my dogs eat (with added salmon oil most of the time, although I did test them to see if they would eat it without the salmon oil, and they did). I highly recommend this wonderful product. A+++++"
This has wonderful flavor--quite spicy but deliciously rich.  Not as hard to chew as some other jerkys.  Would highly recommend.
"This stuff sounded too good to be true, but I tried it anyhow, and WOW am I glad that I did! I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe."
"These are a tasty little treat to have every once in awhile.  It is hard to find grab and go snacks when trying to eat gluten free and paleo.  These are little high on the sugar side (all from fruit, no added sugar) but these are great if you aren't all that concerned with that."
"I thought that (1)package of cocoa was enough to receive a good chocolate taste, and the marshmallows gave an additional sweetness, for a nice cup of hot cocoa."
"I think the price point is perfect to begin with.  It does have a strong smell but it does say ""caffeine"".  It goes on smooth and soaks in easy, no greasy & does not clog pores or hurt eyes.  I also like the fact that all the ingredients are familiar to me.  I recommend it."
"Compared to the grocery store, its more than 50% off.  So what you have to mix it up, don't be a sissy. ;)"
"A delightful new taste in each package.  I love nut snacks, so ordered this as a gift for me!  All are just scrumptious and addictive!  So went back to order more, but price had gone way up since Xmas..darn.  What else can one say??  Grab them if you can and ENJOY.........."
"I am a white, white Maltese. Before Mommy started giving me the Pro-Treat Beef Liver, freeze dried, my tears were black and stained my face. With my enjoying one treat per day, my beautiful white face is so beautiful.  I eat only natural, non colored food and drink spring water. But Mommy says the treats were the icing on the cake. AND, I love them too."
"I had to return this item. The peanuts were not marshmallow at all, but hard as rocks. I doubt it would be humanly possible to bite and/or chew these peanuts. They were all stuck together in the package and there was residue all over the inside of the bag. I'm not sure if they are super old or the bag was not sealed properly. The bag I received was from sweetgourmet.com. First item I have ever had to return to Amazon. We are prime too so we are buying on here a few times a week"
"Great almost expired bread,<br /><br />if only it would arrive with a little longer expiration date.<br /><br />SUGGESTION FOR YOU ALL: ONLY BUY ONE PACKAGE!<br /><br />The trouble is, I like to order several packages, and for some reason Amazon is sending out the bread with only very litte time till it expires.<br /><br />This style bread is supposed to hold for years, and is good to keep in stock for emergencies like hurricanes here in FL, or would be, if it would arrive from Amazon even half fresh!<br /><br />This time I got the bread with expiration date 01/2011 and 02/2011 I ordered in December 2010<br /><br />The expiration date, when it leaves from factory, and arrives to wholesale, surely is more than 2 weeks, probably has 1-2 years if not 5 years on it!<br /><br />I am getting the feeling you are buying some old expired wholesale bread cheap!<br /><br />I am hoping to order this bread in the future with at least 3, rather 6 months stamped expiring date on the package!<br /><br />this is SECOND TIME AMAZON is sending me OLD bread = bread that expires in 1-2 weeks<br />NOT HAPPY! It is only so much crisp bread a person can eat in a week or two<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Bad Bad deal!"
This is my favorite coconut oil for the following reasons...<br /><br />it is delightfully fragrant<br />the smooth texture<br />tastes like it should...coconutty :)<br />fries and cooks and bakes like a charm<br />delectable hand cream<br /><br />My only complaint is that one side (approx. 1 cup) was empty. I hope not to find that problem in future purchases.
My 7 month old golden retriever enjoys these treats! They have helped with training and she basically inhales these when I give them to her.
This pasta tastes like regular pasta. I eat along with my husbad who has to eat gluten free.
"I love this tea.. It was recomended to me by my Dr. to help during pregnancy.. Doesn't taste too bad with some honey, and makes me feel more relaxed."
"I believe this product is of equal quality of some the Italian imported Semolina flours. I am one who does NOT use egg nor white flour to mix in my pasta dough and I find this semolina to be extremely pliable. Not to mention the price here! I love the Italian-imported flours but it becomes way too costly because of the shipping. The fact that Amazon is offering FOUR BAGS of this flour for just over $12 is a steal!!! I live in New York, and when you want a high quality product, you usually end up having to go to a foo-foo upscale gourmet store where you'll end up paying an arm & a leg. I found a 1 lb bag of semolina for roughly $6.00...absurdity! I think this is one of the items where I'll take advantage of the re-order feature because it's simply more economically effective considering I don't want to purchase manufactured pasta anymore. Can't say enough about the quality of this flour...really all I use in my dough is semolina, water, salt and a tbsp of olive oil- makes perfectly flavorful, delicious pasta!!"
I love this Lentil soup. I was thrilled to see it available on Amazon.com. It can be difficult to find in the grocery store.<br />The price is terrific on Amazon!
My husband is hooked on these mints and the cinnamon flavor is hard to find in stores. Was great to purchase enough to last him a while.
"""BUFFY"" LOOKS FORWARD TO HER ""TOY"" EVERY AFTERNOON.  MY BIGGEST FEAR IS RUNNING OUT OF REFILLS BEFORE I CAN ORDER AND RECEIVE MORE."
This rice was quick to fix and the flavor was remarkable. Add to that the fact that the rice is organic only adds to the excellence of the product. LOVED IT!!
"I never write reviews.  Don't care to spend the time.<br /><br />But for these mints????<br /><br />I am a cinnamon freak!  I can't get enough of any cinnamon candy no matter how hot, sweet, or hard they can be.  These are by far the best cinnamon mints that exist.<br /><br />Enough said..."
"Even though I opted out of recieving ""email reminders"" to leave feedback/reviews I just received one from this company, so here's my review:<br /><br />I've already left a review for the SodaStream machine, and it is not complimentary due to the monopoly on the CO2.  Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax."
"Royal Oak is the very best at this moment.  There are a dozen other brands that I have tried and, speaking as a former Virginian, this one is at the summit.  They are so large, so crunchy, and so tasty that you will insist on EATING THEM ONE AT A TIME.  The Royal Oak container is still a 40-ounce can, which was once the industry standard.  Many competitors have slipped to 36 ounces or even 32.  Be careful when you select others.  You may not be buying the number of peanuts you expected.  Don't accept any peanuts that were canned over six months ago, as they could be stale.  I am not connected with this company in any way, other than as a customer."
"I love this mix and I use it for everything. I like baking with it better than with wheat flour.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I sure wish they would fix the zipper on the 4lb bags. Drives me nuts. I can never get them to close properly."
"I love Cashews, but this product SUCKED! It had too much Pepper. I washed them off and put them in the toaster oven to freshen them up. Now they are semi descent."
"This cereal is a great way to start your day.  Just by itself, I will admit, it is a little bland.  Here is how I eat it every day.  1 bowl with two teaspoons of splenda, some cinnamon, and unsweetened vanilla almond breeze almond milk (half the calories of milk, can be found at Trader Joe's or whole foods).  Wonderful!"
I love the taste and consistency of this bar. And the added calcium is a plus. But I try not to eat it too often because it has 12 grams of fat and the saturated fat is 25% of daily value. And 2g of protein is a bummer.
"A friend of mine raved about this tea and I love Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, so I decided to try it. Now I have six boxes of a tea I don't like as much as Bigelow.  It is too candy-like for my taste; I like a bit more tea flavor. So I would definitely recommend trying it before you buy 6 boxes."

"Our family loves these pop tarts and we were glad to find them as the grocery stores will no longer carry them.  That said, at least three of the pop tart boxes were crushed upon delivery.  Makes them hard to toast and eat.  I am not sure who I can tell to make sure they are handled better next time."
"This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite."
"Love this product and since I had a hard time finding it, was so happy to see it on Amazon!  It is a easy meal that is full of flavor and the meat gets extremly tender and delicious!  I'll be ordering more when I run out!"
"I was buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYDXVE"">Enfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG"">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not ""leak"" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8"">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3"" X 4""</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.<br /><br />These options are the best value for your money. You have a new baby, you have PLENTY of other things to spend your money on, the list never ends babies suck you dry, so don't waste the money on these if you don't have to. Hope this helps."
"Delicious, fragrant tea.  This is the best chai tea I've ever tasted and it's very inexpensive (as far as this kind of tea goes).  I used to buy it in local stores but it's been unavailable the last year. I can't live without it and was glad to find it on Amazon."
"The Green Mountain Co. has a great assortment of different coffees and teas, and many are my favorites.  This variety box has many good ones, but there were about half that are in the stronger, dark roast category, such as the dark roast and french roast. I find these a bit stronger than I like, so I make a 12 oz. mug using two sixes. Overall a good product, I would just prefer a few more of the light and medium roasts like Donut Shop."
"Over the years I've tried every energy and protein bar out there but these are the best tasting I've ever had especially the chocolate ones. I have to hide them from my kids who think they are candy bars, delicious."
"I discovered you can use ketchup or any other condiment - bbq sauce, mayo, mustard, etc. for a great alternative to french fries."
Love the vanilla taste. Tastes natural and not like any of the other splenda options available at the super market.<br />Will definitely buy again.
"Revisited this review and just wanted to say you need this in a hot area.  Mine sprouted and I tried to move them from inside the house to outside and they wilted and died.  The product is fine and works but these peppers are very hard to grow.  I did get another to grow but need very high temps 85F and very little water.  To much kills them aswell as they will rot.  The peppers are hotter than most.  They are very edible but they are very different from most you may be used to.  For one they smell very smokey almost BO like.  Yet they taste fruity at first and a slow rolling mack truck sneaks up and hits ya.<br /><br />  The heat eating by itself is pretty intense.  Not like the morons on youtube but it will make ya sweat and if on an empty stomach it could make ya ill for a bit.  Other than that just a buyer beware that these are very hard to grow,"
"I got these as a Christmas present, all I can say is that they are beautiful, delicious! One piece counts as a dessert for me, its so magical, so wow different! Each bite is a piece of magnificent decadent edible art!"
I always wanted to make the stuffed pancakes and this batter works great.  Very light and delicious.  I even use it for waffles and it works great.
"This peach tea honestly tastes like it was flavored with peach-scented soap.  The tea itself is probably fine, but the flavoring that they used is overpowering and barely resembles peach flavor.  After I opened the package, a cheap, artificial peach scent filled the entire room, which was not bad in itself, but the soapy taste made this tea completely unacceptable.  It sounds cruel to say this, but the flavor of this tea is closer to peach shampoo than peach tea."
"I tried this when I was in Southern California and cannot find it anywhere in northern California.  I like it because it is poultry and has natural ingredients with no preservatives.  I can eat it instead of a protein bar, I can take it camping, it doubles as ""emergency earthquake supplies"".  AND it's not full of fat or sugar.  I find the price a little high, but i make sure to have the bag last for several days."
I bought the AeroGarden in hopes of starting my own indoor garden since I live in a highrise apartment and off the ground.  I also get the morning sun so growing plants on my balcony is hard to do.  I searched the internet in hopes of a indoor garden for myself and I came accross Amazon.com they had on their site the AeroGarden.  I purchased the AeroGarden and within a few days it arrived and wow!! I'm still impressed with it I put it together the same day I got it wich was March 31/11.  within the first 5 days I saw seedlings.  On April 22/11 I transplanted my plants into a flower pots.  I will purchase another 7 pod black AeroGarden again soon. I had a bit of a problem with setting the timer other than that it was eay to assemble.  I highly recommend the AeroGarden to anyone who wants to start their own indoor Garden.  The AeroGarden is the right thing to own it's the size of a meduim sized plant and it sits on a end table. I bought the Gourmet Herb seeds and I found that the Dill and Mint took the longest to grow but they did come through ok and now they are bigger then the other plants. I'm so happy that I got this AeroGarden it's the best investment I had ever made.
"This is very tasty beef jerky, but a little too expensive. If the price was lower i would order this on a regular basis."
I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup
I have purchased this vanilla in a smaller quantity from a retail cooking store many times. This is a much better value and I use the vanilla in all my baking. YUM!
very good ..very yummy... just  wish  jalapeno potato came in super share bags !!!!  that would be super awesome !
Arrived in a well packed box with modern square glass vase.  These gorgeous roses lasted more than a week.  I would definitely buy again.
"I am sorry to say these cookies did not taste at all like sugar cookies. They were actually salty, and not nice and chewy. The only good thing is that they arrived in one piece, no crumbs. However it did not deliver on the taste. Iw ill no0t be ordering from Scott's items again."
I am pretty fussy when it comes to pie crust and it may not be moms recipe but it comes pretty close. For a mix it is darn good. Great for a quick pie.
"I have to LOL a bit at the ""How do you rate this item?"" question for this review.  How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that."
"I started using Lawry's Enchilada Sauce seasonings packets years ago when we lived in CA. When we moved to MN 20 years ago I was able to find it in stores here but in the last couple of years it has been unavailable. I have requested the stores start carring it again, to no avail. I was so excited to learn I could order it through Amazon and did. One hint, I sift out all the dried onion flakes before I add the remaining spices to the tomato paste. I prefer to sprinkle fresh green onion over the homemade cheese covered Enchiladas or Chili Rellenos along with a couple of dollops of sour cream and 2 or 3 olives.<br /><br />Wonderful!"
"Product has the fewest steps in preparation, rolls out the easiest, is the crispiest and best tasting.  Have tried two other products of this tyoe and Namaste GF pizza mix rocks!"
"This is very good coffee. I don't like strong coffee, this is nice and mild, a great breakfast blend. I use cream in it and it is just great. Will buy again."
This coffee is great. I was referred to it by a friend and I decided to try it. Rich flavor and a great price. Can't beat it.
"- This granola is okay; not great, not awful.<br />- The texture is nice.<br />- A bit too sweet for my taste, almost sickeningly so.<br />- The paper thin almond slivers are used quite sparingly.<br />- The prevalent taste is coconut.<br />- It gets rather boring after a while since there is not enough variance in ingredients to make each bite a bit different (as with a fruit & nut granola, for example, where each bite may have a different type of fruit and/or nut to give it some variety) so every bite is exactly like the previous one.<br />- I mixed it with some Bear Naked F&N which improved it"
Ordered this to use as handouts for a presentation. Was great for that. The packages are small. Most have 5-6 bears in them though a couple had only 3-4. Also my tub of 72 actually only contained 69 packages.
"I bought 238 Barbara's Bakery Low Fat Traditional Blueberry Bars, 12-Ounce Boxes for my pet green iguana.  Unfortunately, he died as a result from too much grease intake a few weeks before.  So I was stuck with the 238 Boxes.<br /><br />Blueberry is not my favorite but these are really fresh, good and tasty.  They are sweet and taste natural.  Very good product.<br /><br />My neighbor, Halbert, who is part of the fat acceptance movement, invited himself over to eat them since they expire in 3 months.  He clocks in at 560 lbs.  He comes over to watch TV and eat these, imposing himself upon my company, which is annoying.<br /><br />So far, no complaints and he has gas problems, which I found out.  The organic figs help him out I think.  Hopefully he'll finish eating them soon so he can stop bothering me."
"Love this healthy treat for my cat! I actually grind it up into a powder, and mix with water on demand when giving medicine to my cat. I used to give him smelly wet food, but I just couldn't handle gagging 2 times a day...<br /><br />Since I ground it into a fine powder, I did notice some pea-sized bits of hard something, most likely bone. This might not be an issue for a big dog, but for my small, old cat, I have to be sure to pick these pieces out. Just be observant when feeding your pet.<br /><br />I used to buy this product locally, but I found they were selling it for over twice the price per ounce, so this is a GREAT value!"
"As I ordered a 12 pack of O.N.E. Coconut Water, I remember thinking ""Twelve? What on earth am I going to do with 12 of them?"".  An easy way to get potassium was what I was looking for, but when I took my first sip I was hooked!  Not only is this loaded with the potassium I needed for my nightly leg cramps, it has a mild, pleasant flavor. Talk about refreshing; I can't wait for summer now!  There is an instant cooling sensation, a pleasant, smooth mouth-feel, and a thirst quenching ability you wish a soda had.  I've tried other brands, but they come across as ""raw"" or harsh; for me O.N.E. is the V.S.O.P. of coconut waters (to me, that means the best).  My shipment arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect shape.  If you want electrolytes in a delicious, healthy form, this is your stuff. As far as my hesitancy on ordering a twelve pack... there'll be an order for another twelve pack arriving soon!"
"I totally believe that if you eat this product (without adding milk, honey, brown sugar or anything else) that you will lose at least 10% of your body weight after one month.  It has happened to me several times, so I believe it.  It tastes great, and is good for you.  What else do you need/want?"
"I unexpectedly got a box of 100. Obviously didn't check it properly. I do not regret though, as I do enjoy the taste of this tea. It's smell  is another issues. It fades fairly fast, and when you sip tea is satisfying."
"I'm so happy to have found a high quality wet food for my miniature dachshund. Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long."
"Back from vet.  Vet is about 100% sure it was this chew stick that upset my dog.  His digestive tract is inflammed and will have to be on meds. He is not allowed to eat anything today. My vet said that even one is a lot for my size dog (I brought this to the vet with me), but bag said small dog, one per day (dog weighs 20 pounds). He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one.  The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this.  He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these.  AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.  I believe it is the inside of the chew stick that made him ill, as THAT is what he threw up.  It is distinctive and hard to miss!<br /><br />Particularly if you have a SMALL dog, I would be wary of this chew stick.  I'm not saying it would upset ALL small dogs tummies, just that it is hardly mini and if my vet said it was too big for my 20 pound dog.<br /><br />I have read a lot of dogs love this and did fine with it. Unfortunately mine didn't and it seems SOME other dogs (mostly smaller ones) didn't either.<br /><br />Just trying to save dog owners the worry of seeing their dog in distress and a big vet bill."
"Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup. I apologize about that."
"I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic. Also, they do contain eggs."
"Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy is a mixed bag.  I have been cutting my hair very short on my head recently and this product wonderfully moisturizers my scalp and also helps with my hair when it is dry and damaged.  You should use this product very sparingly.  I take just a drop or two and rub my hands together and then apply it over my head.  I then wash my hands right away.  Mineral oil, like many cosmetics ingredients, is suspected to be a bit toxic.  However, mineral oil is a very effective moisturizer."
"A couple of cooking forums I belong to highly recommend these tomatoes.  Since I couldn't find them locally (no surprise), I ordered them here.  After S&H, they were pretty expensive, so we did a 'blind taste test' between these & Progresso brand.  Progresso won!  The San Marzano were good, but not worth the price IMHO."
"The k-cups were all in one box, great packaging. Gloria Jean's hazelnut was delicious.  Definately would purchase this product again."
I sent this to my little sis for her 30th birthday. I wanted to send her something fun.  She loved it!  She was a candy freak when we were kids (and still is sometimes) so this was perfect. Lots of candy and the box it came in was really cute too.
"I bought this food for my already sick cat and he hated it so much he lost 2 more pounds and refused to eat it. This is coming from a cat who'll eat almost anything including spaghetti, yogurt, oatmeal and lettuce. Stay away from this; it really was a bad choice for my cat."
"I bought this grudgingly because my favorite Timothy's Italian Blend was out of stock...... and I was very happily surprised! It's not as ""big""  and winey a brew as my favorite, but was flavorful, had a delicious aroma and was smooth. I tend to like rather potent coffee but I have clients who prefer a little lighter cup..... this will be perfect! I will happily keep buying this coffee. Thanks Wolfgang!"
I was alittle worried when I bought this that it being sugar free would mean a funny after taste.  Boy was I wrong.  I love this stuff!  It is warm and sweet and the hint of caramel is something really special.  I keep it as a special treat for those cool nights.  It's  must try for anyone who needs to or wants less/no sugar and likes hot apple cider!  Now if I only had a fireplace still.
"Interestingly, even when comparing with other sauces, this immediately brought to mind Taco Bell.  I never realized their sauces were so distinctive.<br /><br />With regard to the sauce itself, the consistency is thick, tasting like a mayonnaise base with some BBQ Sauce added and then mixed with some chipotle (minus the seeds). Mildly warm, extremely creamy... certainly not bad... more like comfort food - what you would grab in the middle of the night, not what you would feed to honored guests.<br /><br />So... it fills the bill for standard fare, but would be just as easy to make your own and cut down some of the fat and salt (of which this sauce has a ton of both!!!) and pick up some extra flavor and ""freshness"". Hope this review is helpful.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
"March update: Wife brings me the empty box of tea. ""I only have one more box left. Get more.""<br /><br /> - - - -<br /><br />At Christmas, my wife asked for Earl Gray Tea like she had ... 20 years ago. Stronger Bergamot flavor.<br /><br />Being such a nice guy, I bought her premium earl gray teas. None I tried were strong enough. I tried Twinings, Stash, Bigelow, Tazo, ... nothing had enough flavor. Than, I saw this. This, Stash Double Bergamot. She likes it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what changed over the years but the flavor of most of the earl gray tea is weak."
We bought some in grocery store by accident and all of us love it but price in store is bit high so we googled on line and found the direct sell.
You are reading the review for a reason. The reviews speak for themselves. This stuff is second to none. Buy it. End of story.
Great coffee!  Love all Green Mountain coffee and all the wonderful flavors.  Would and do recommend this coffee to all my friends.
"Pretty good product, fresh and good smell. Decent price with 'subscribe and save'. I'm using my second batch of 3 bottles and still like it."
"Great tasting, versatile, mild. Goes well in soup, stew and stir fry, but it should be added to other things in the meal, rather than served alone. I had hoped the pieces would be larger, which is why I awarded only 4 stars.<br /><br />Eating exceptionally high portions of Hijiki every day can cause problems because of inorganic arsenic. I eat modest amounts less often, and am not concerned."
"As soon as I opened a packet, I was impressed; it actually smelled like a real margarita.  The taste is great too.  I typically favor the lemonade varieties as they aren't too sweet and this one fits right in.  I like limes, so this is perfect.  The margarita flavor is nicely refreshing."
"I love, love,love,love zevia !!! thank god for its existence daily !!! It tastes great, it is good for you, and mother earth too ! Wow Zevia is a refreshing supplement and I will be a life long customer, I hope they come up with a DR Z flavor...hint... hint...<br /><br />Thanks Zevia,<br /><br />Natasha"
"One of the main reasons I used to have for going to Costco was the delicious tomato bisque they used to have. It was a Kirkland-Campbell Tomato Bisque and I would buy it by the dozens. Unfortunately, I can't find it there any more. Checked two stores already, none to be found. So I tried Amazon and the closest match I could find. But it has very little to do with the bisque I loved so much. Now I am stuck with 11 cans I have no use for. Any suggestions?"
This is my choice of this type of products.  I will recommend it to any one.
My twin 12 month old girls love them and they seem wonderful.  Was very dissapointed when I saw they were made in China though.  Don't think I'll buy them any longer because of that.
Make your own jerky and save money.  This product has MSG in it.  It's bad for you and unhealthy.  Just look on youtube how to make it yourself.  You don't need preservatives in your homemade jerky if you eat it within the week.
"Probably the best thing about MIO is its portability and sharability. The problem is that the flavor  may not be outstanding enough for anyone to want to share.<br /><br />I don't particularly care for the phony label ""Water Enhancer"". Adding an artificial color, artificial sweetener, and an unnatural taste that only approximates the flavor created in nature does not seem like an enhancement to me.<br /><br />The MIO is easy to use - flip open the cap, squeeze some MIO into the water for an explosion of color, taste, squeeze again, taste, squeeze again if necessary, continue squeezing and tasting until satisfied, and then clip the lid shut.<br /><br />The inexact nature of the squeeze is a sticking point for me because it's almost impossible to duplicate the exact amount squeezed each time. One could measure half a teaspoon of liquid first but that defeats the design of the product.<br /><br /> I've only tried the Mango/Peach. It has great color but only average taste that tastes slightly artificial. There is a chalky aftertaste after each swallow, but not an obtrusive one.  I much prefer Crystal Light for taste though I also find it tedious to mix just the right amount of product into the water with the CL.<br /><br />Anyone so inclined might find it easy to shoplift such a small handful of a container, but the taste of the product might preclude such shenanigans."
These are straws filled with lemon flavored honey.  I love them.  They taste great and are easy to take with you.  I use them at work- very convenient for quick hot tea without the messy honey.
"let's face it not spending a lot on this caviar. It's going to taste like that. I would not recommend eating this caviar from the jar. It's not that kind of caviar. It is a little fishy, maybe more than other caviar's, but it's actually not a bad product altogether. I would recommend serving or using this caviar with things such as sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or some nicely selected crackers. I have even found a pretty good recipe for a tasty little appetizer using this type of caviar. I recommend it either looking for a good recipe or using extras to mask the extra fishy taste"
"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?"
"What's not to like? Great price, free shipping and comes to your door. My grandsons come often so we go through lots of cereal and this is one both the small kids and big kids enjoy eating."
I love it.<br /><br />But at least 40 per cent of the people I've tried it on have looked bewildered when they get their first swallow.  Even those who claim to like hot and spicy foods.<br /><br />It sure was nice when I lived near a specialty foods market that sometimes carried it.
"The taste is ok but I just can't see myself buying this again.I have been a big Taco Bell fan for years, however this spicy ranchero sauce does nothing for me."
"After reading several reviews and being an avid fan of gummy candy, I decided to give these a shot. I am glad I did! They are definitely delicious. My only complaint is that the bags are too big. You gotta open them with company around, otherwise you will definitely end up eating too many.<br /><br />That being said, you should definitely give these a shot."
"I would think that a company aware of food allergies would make sure to list their ingredients for customers of their products, and my REPEATED requests to AMZ to compel vendors to do so are dismissed and ignored.  So much for sensitivity.  Can anyone please list the ingredients for these?  Then those of us with multiple food allergies and hoping to be able to purchase these will know if they are safe for us.  Thank you."
"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
I bought these all of the time as an alternative to the supermarket fruit snacks.  They are not full of yucky fillers... I even enjoy a little bunny snack treat occasionally :)
I do like Cheerios and I like the honey nut the best.<br /><br />I just cannot believe the price here!  The local stores have this at less than half this price and you don't have to buy 3 boxes of it.
"OK, so it isn't exactly as good as grilled cheese, but melting a slice of cheese on one of these crispy discs in the microwave is close enough for me, plus no need for fattening butter. The ""thins"" are about a quarter-inch thick (maybe a little less), not too thick and not too thin.  They offer a multitude of options for quick GF meals, perfect for someone like me who typically eats several 1-course small meals throughout the day vs. 3 large multi-course ones.  The taste is very mild, relying on whatever you put on them to add 95% of the flavor.  By the way, they are called Corn Thins, but technically they are made out of ""popped corn""; so they are a little puffy, sort of like rice cakes but thinner and crispier.<br />My batch just arrived with an expiration date of October 2010, which is a tight time frame but because these are so versatile, I think I can manage finishing them by then.<br /><br />UPDATE (Feb. 2010) The last two unfinished packages were stale by the end of August.  In spite of the inner foil liners, they didn't make it to the specified EXP date and I ended up throwing those two away.  Because the bulk quantity is so high (6 would make more sense) I'm afraid I won't be buying this again; I just can't finish them in time."
Great snack when your trying to eat healthy but still need to have something salty and tasty. It is a bit pricey but still worth the money.  I would recommend the Sweet and Spicy Chipotle as it is very flavorful and satisfies the craving for sweet and also salty.
"I've had my Keurig for a year, and my only complaint has been the quality of the coffee made:  Not bad, but not nearly strong enough for people who think their coffee should run like molten lava rather than a fast trickling stream (OK, not really sludge, but you get what I mean).  The closest I came to finding a good cup was Dunkin Donuts' Dunkin Dark, but they are pretty expensive from the store.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here, I decided to give Jet Fuel a try.  WHOA!  This is proper coffee that will put hair on your chest, but also tastes DELICIOUS.  Buying in packs of 50 for a family with 3 coffee drinkers (and frequent visitors) also means fewer trips to the store for coffee.<br /><br />Very happy I chose to buy this brand, and now enjoy my morning hassle-free cup of coffee!"
"If your cat's pills are small, use a half a pill pocket.  The treat is smaller so the cat doesn't chew it as much, and he's less likely to run into the bad tasting pill and spit it out."
There was much to read as to labels and ingredients of this sausage kit. We were disappointed to find MSG in the Italian sausage mix or else this would have received five stars. Before buying this product I read all I could find on what was in these packages without success. The casings and the instructions for the casings were easy to understand. They were easy to install on the sausage tube of the grinder. But the Italian sausage mix has MSG.
Super good price and super fast delivery<br /><br />I'm happy and my K-9 companion hs good teeth and breath
"Ah Red Bull, equally fantastic as an energy drink or as a 'mixer' for 'adult beverages,' as my Grandmother used to call them. What can I say that you don't already know? Weather you're looking for an shot of energy or something tasty to blend with vodka and a fresh lime, Red Bull will not disappoint.<br /><br />I find that the low calorie version has about the same flavor as regular, but feels thinner in the mouth. I actually prefer the low cal stuff, and its a staple in my fridge.<br /><br />I should also mention that Red Bull can only truly be appreciated if you've had other 'lesser' energy drinks (rock star comes to mind). Red bull is superior in taste, consistency, and usually has fewer calories. I've tried a good number of energy drinks, and Red Bull is easily the best out there."
"These bars are great - and I am not even particularly fond of cranberries. They are not overly sweet (I can't quite stomach chocolate early in the morning), but provide a good, solid start to the day. They are my favorite breakfast bar right now, and for those who do like cranberries, you will love these."
"I've tried a number of different brands of coconut oil. And so far, this is the best I've tried. I actually started using coconut oil for my skin as I have suffered with very dry skin my entire life. It absorbs quickly and since I love the smell of coconut, it was perfect for me. But don't worry, if you don't love the smell of coconut, it fades pretty quickly. I then started using it as an oil treatment for my hair with fantastic results. Finally, I'm starting to incorporate into my cooking. Needless to say, I am very pleased and will just put this on auto ship!"
"These are great!  I feel like Im eating candy, its hard to believe they are just fruit!  I love them all.  The java lime is a bit sour so if you dont like sour these might not be for you.  The rest are all sweet.  I love these and will buy them again."
Great priced 12 (total 48 envelopes) pack box. Almost half of what we pay in the stores. Excellent for traveling.
"This was a split in the family - my husband and son did not notice a metal taste - but my daughter and I could taste it overwhelmingly! I drink Poland Spring Seltzer lemon flavor etc... from cans so that isn't the issue.  I've had this same soda in bottles and love the taste - especially the grapefruit!  This has much less sugar than regular soda and is organic.  But, did you know it is made by PEPSI??  I didn't until I wrote to the company online to tell them about the metal taste and received an email back from PEPSI. It is a tad deceiving for the IZZE company to claim to be its own entity when it is owned and operated by PEPSI.  Maybe it is like many of these organic companies who were bought out by the big giants - unable to make it on their own...<br />But, the metal taste was so bad we were unable to drink ANY of them!"
"This is very good honey. Rich, creamy, with a floral flavor. You almost get the flavor of honeycomb with out the waxy feel in your mouth. Some honey tastes strong, this honey just has a lot of flavor. I bought this to put in my tea but so far I have just been enjoying it plain."
I bought this coffee for my wife office and they seem to love it.  Good coffee and great sale price.  You can not go wrong with this coffee.
"The ONLY reason I give ZATARAIN'S NEW ORLEANS STYLE JAMBALAYA MIX, 8-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 12), four stars instead of 5 is because one must buy 12 boxes together, here on Amazon.  It's scrumptious rice, but I must agree with another reviewer who said his family got tired of it after ""only"" 3 boxes, and the rest is now sitting on the shelf. Too much of anything -- even something as delicious as this rice -- does get tiring after a while.  Of oourse there are all kinds of customers who buy from Amazon -- some people are lucky enough to have friends, family or neighbours to share the large quantities, and prices, that Amazon puts into it's quantity packages.<br />But others, like myself, have only two -- or only one-- person for whom to buy food.  Thus, I think that BOTH large quantity packaging, (12), and small quantity packaging, (4?), should be made available.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it is truly superb!  It has just the right amount of spice, and just the right kind of spice.  It will not burn your taste-buds as some overly-spicy rice does...nor will it bore your taste-buds, as too-plain rice does.  To quote Goldilocks: ""This one is JUST right!""<br /><br />Totally yummy!  But I don't want to have to eat quite so much!"
I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.
"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Beautiful deep red kidney beans. Great for or added to vegan chili. Tasty on salad with vinaigrette dressing. Ready to eat right from the package. Can be a nutritious snack too. Labeled 'vegan' right on the can. 385 calories, 21g protein per can. Great value, especially for quality organic beans. Highly recommended. Also really like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXH5E"">Natural Value Organic Beans, Pinto, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.

"Maybe if I used two pods, I might get the desired flavor out of a small cup of coffee?  I don't know.  I didn't taste any chocolate or buttercruch...or even coffee for that matter.  To the contrary, all I could taste out of one of these pods was the half pouch of Splenda I used to sweeten it.  Maybe I got an old pod, but I think it's pretty fair to say that I won't be buying these separately.  They are marginally better than the ones you can buy directly from Senseo."
"I love this sauce.  This sauce is made to showcase Guajillo peppers, and it does so very well.  If you are not familiar with Guajillo's, they are similar to Ancho's but with a more chocolatey flavor.<br /><br />It is my favorite in the Bufalo line, and is the original sauce that started it all for that company.  Very highly recommended."
"OK, what did I expect? They're sun ripened, DRIED tomatoes, right?  No. These are really dry and really can't be eaten unless you soak them first. If you don't mind soaking them, they taste just fine."
I have ordered this product many times. I do wish could count for a non shipping fee item like it used to be instead of having it shipped from somewhere else.
"Do not buy these terrible,tiny and extremely salty snacks.  You cannot even call it a snack because they're so little.  Awful taste and salt-laden, save your cash."
"I am so glad I tried this premium dog food at a great price for a small (but not too small) bag to try it. My dog loves it and I feel better about giving her something healthy. Next I will try the canned food. I do wish these companies would offer 6 can deals however instead of just 12 and 24 can deals for ""taste-testing"". Not every dog likes a drastic change from junk foods to higher quality food. Meanwhile, no more Purina ever!"
"I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of ""flavor enhancer"".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free."
"I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the aftertaste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available - 10 years? - because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time. When it comes to cooking, the Splenda is calibrated to be the equivalent of sugar by volume. In other words, a cup of Splenda is used whenever the recipe calls for a cop of sugar."
"I purchased this cat food after careful research on all the different wet cat food available.  I finally decided this was the best even though it was on the high side of expensive.  I never considered that ALL of my 4 adult cats and 3 kittens would refuse to touch it. Really???  I have never seen them do that before so I thought to try again on another day.  Nope not a fluke-- they steer clear of this food completely.  I will be donating the remaining 22 cans to the SPCA (where I adopted the three kittens from).  Wasted money?  Maybe, but hopefully the cats in the shelter will eat it."
"These cookies are a bit on the expensive side--with that said, THEY ARE GREAT for dogs with food allergies. My pup is allergic to almost everything. He loves these cookies so much and so far they have been good for his internals. I can't praise these cookies enough.<br /><br />This package arrived at my home in bad condition. The outer box was smashed and someone had taped it together. The monzies cookie box was also smashed and the bag inside the cookie box was torn. The cookies were loose inside the box. I contacted Amazon and in 2 days, they had a replacement box of cookies in the mail to me. Can't go wrong with these folks either.<br /><br />All around, this was an OK experience."
"I LOVE my CLICK in the morning... I buy both and I have both on subscription orders through Amazon --I can't run out!  My day just doesn't start out right unless I ""click"" first!  I have been drinking the Mocha flavor for the past year and couldn't wait for the vanilla to be released, I just knew I was going to love it.  I was right, it's yummy! I love it more than the mocha flavor, it seems smoother and it doesn't have as strong of coffee taste to it either.  I love the smell of the vanilla when you open the canister, but thankfully it does NOT have an overpowering sweet vanilla taste to it.  I actually prefer my Click Vanilla Latte to the ""[...]"" v. latte--it's great.  I am so thankful for both Click products, it helps me get my daily protein requirements each day, it has helped me reach my weight loss goals, and it gives me a little kick of energy in the afternoons when I need it and I don't know what I would do without it to start my mornings.  Do yourself a favor and Click!<br /><br />p.s. I wish Amazon sold the ""CLICK"" shaker cup --it's my favorite shaker cup too but I don't want to pay the S & H to get another one -that makes it too expensive!  Although if I lost mine I would probably break down and buy it anyway..."
"Delicious flavor. I eat it with a salad right from the pouch. No canned taste, no extra fluid, just good tuna. Would recommend."
I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.
I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.
"I use this on Mexican dishes, rice, beans, etc.  I am a huge fan of Habanero sauces and this green sauce takes the cake.  I haven't found anything similar in quality or spiciness.  Highly recommend if it if you enjoy a nice hot green sauce."
"I bought these when I was looking for low point snacks as I have been doing Weight Watchers.  I eat the cinnamon apples when I want something crunchy.  When I want chewy and a little sweeter, I eat the dried pears.  While many times I do eat 2 packages for a snack, I still buy the .64 ounce bags since I have to get up and go get a second bag giving myself time to decide if I really still am hungry.  While it is true that some pieces have core and/or seed on them, I find it easy to cut that off or eat around it.  This is a great diet food and I like that it is organic."
"I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste."
"This product was recommended to me by my cat's veterinarian.  The product really works with my cat.  It's not obvious when you order, but there are two sizes of pill pockets, and this is the smaller size (size of the pocket, not just quantity).  It works for what I need to give my cat, but may not work for some pills, so I advise buyers to pay attention to this."
"This product takes getting used to.  Only after using about 3 K-cups did I start liking it.  However, I wouldn't buy this many again."
"For the No Sugar Added version, this stuff tastes good. You also don't need to use a 1/3 cup like the old CBTL version of this powder, only a few tablespoons. However, no matter how hot your liquid, it is really hard to get it all to dissolve. I have ""whisked"" it and still wound up with clumps at the bottom of the coffee."
I sent this back to the dealer because they sent me chocolate chip not spearmint.  I am still waiting for my exchanged.
"As you can tell from my user name, I'm a bit of a coffee lover and have been for years however, I despise crummy coffee, instant coffee, coffee fillers, artifical flavorings etc...I like rich, dark arabica coffee served strong and black.<br /><br />Typically I grind my own (organic) beans using a vintage mill and french press but there are times when it's not possible to make a decent cup of coffee. This fits the bill perfectly. A nice balance, not weak but not overpowering, solid arabic rather than the inferior robusta and all the convenience. Kosher (important) and relatively free from preservatives etc... I wish there was an organic option but aside from that, I was very impressed by the flavor."
"Good product, but I do not feel the energizing effects as I did when I had some in Ecuador.  Should be stronger."
"When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie"
I bought thinking it was capuccino but it is way too sweet for my taste. And diabetics should'nt have that much sugar. No more for me.
"I'll start by saying that my dog, a 6m old Bloodhound, loves to chew, devourer is more accurate, on these bones.  However, she can be a bit picky about her bones but the 8 inch Smokehouse bones she absolutely loves!  There's lots of meat on the bone and they keep her busy few a couple hours.  The bones are very greasy so be prepared to have some place for you dog to chew these.  I typically put her in her kennel until she gets it down to the nub. Outside would be best but still too cold for that.  I keep a bag on hand at all times!"
"WE love these crackers and have ordered them before. However this time it took forever for them to arrive ...and when they did, they were all broken (smashed )... they were like bread crumbs !!!! Not good.<br /> The Crackers ( when intact) are amazing !"
"I have a Jack Russell Terrier who loves these dog treats...he is a very finicky eater, but he can't wait for one of these treats.  The sweet potatoe is nice and chewy and it's wrapped in a duck jerky that he loves.  I'm so glad I finally found something he will eat."
I really like this product. I grow orchids and scale is a problem. This product breaks the cycle and no more bugs. I highly recommend this product.
I love this tea. It is a little strong but it has a different taste but I love it.
"i should have tried this flavor before buying bulk here.  my daughter loves puffs in general and she really liked the sweet potato ones we got before this one.  but the apple cinnamon flavor is a little too 'artificial' and strong. instead of grabbing them by the handful, she doesn't seem too interested to eat these.."
These are great!  Our dog needed to take medicine 2X/day for a month.  Getting her to take the pills was hard until these pill pockets.  We simply put the medicine in the pocket and she ate it right up!  They are the best!
"If there good enough for the King of Sweden (as the box indicates)they are good enough for me. They also have other flavors, all good and the price is right."
"The product description used metric measurements, not mainline American inches measurements.  Thus I ended up getting the wrong size and wanting to exchange the product.  I discovered the shipping and restocking charges were more than the cost of the original order.  Not at all pleased with the transaction.  Owner did not seem to care about whether I was happy or not.  He just said he's always had a great rating and I must be the problem.  I wasn't looking to set blame on anyone, I was looking to make things right.  I threw the product away and vowed to never knowingly do business with this company again."
"I am the buyer for a 20-person department.  The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one.  I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz.<br />""Fogchaser"" sums it up pretty well.  This will clear your head and get you ready to roll.<br />I also love that there is less packaging.  I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation.  (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.  I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher.  But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma."
I just tried the Youndoo seasoning and like it ALOT. I like it as a dipping sauce for my Mandu's. I added a little bit in my bulgogi and decreased the amount of soy sauce and the taste was phenomenal! Love it!
Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
"I can't get my 10 month old to eat any ""dinner"" type baby food.  I thought this would be different, but it's not.  Baby doesn't like it, so it's no good to me.  Not sure what I am going to do with the other 15 packs."
First class food for my pups.  Fair price and about as convienient as is comes.  Definitely the way to purchase your pet food.
It does not state that these bars need to be refrigerated.  All of them got moldy in a short period of time.
"YUM, YUM, YUM!!!<br /><br />It's the same that we used to get at local A&P stores."
"I am definitely a chocolate lover, and fond of granola as a cereal so thought I'd try a bag of this, even though it isn't necessarily meant as a cereal. I think it would be a bit hard to eat as a snack, as the granola is fairly crumbly and not in large chunks. The chocolate as well is separate from the granola so hard to just eat from the bag. As a cereal, it tastes amazing! I probably would have liked a little *less* chocolate just so I didn't feel so much like I was eating candy, but I can't fault the taste at all, it really had a great blend of granola crunch, a bit of sweetness, and that semi-sweet chocolate taste that blended perfectly. Definitely not something I would eat everyday, but for a mid-day snack with milk, I really loved it."
"My husband and I really like this gum. It's one of the flavors we enjoy (also like  Green Tea, Spearmint and fruit which tastes kind of like juicy fruit gum). We chew this after meals and I like that it satisfies my sweet tooth while preventing decay at the same time!"
"Upon opening the package, you get an immediate pleasing scent of the ginger: this would be a great air freshener for a room at moderate levels.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, the tea tasted just terrible - the ginger and honey / lemon combination are more than just intense, they are so overpowering over the top of each other vs. complimentary, I just couldn't take it past three sips.  There is also a strong taste of something like cayenne pepper that burns the heck out of the back of your throat: in addition to having a bad taste, the cayenne reminds you of it long after you're done with that last swallow."
"After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them."
"This dry kibble was the third try in our quest to find a balanced kibble for our Bernese Moutnain Dog. There is plenty of technical information about what to feed your dog and, nearly overwhelmed, we entered the pet food market with an idea of feeding a quality kibble, but chose to avoid high-end designer food, high protein (>26%), bi-products, wheat, soy, and corn. We decided that whole grains, fruits, and vegitables would be an acceptable source of carbohydrates but wanted the ratio to be 40% or less (hard to do when you avoid high protien foods). We also believe chicken is the easiest protein source for our dog to digest. Lastly, we wanted to be near 24% Protien and 14% Fat. Keep in mind that our review below is based on our pet, and every pet will react to food differently.<br /><br />We fed Precise, which was only a great puppy food. We fed Canadae, which resulted in loose stool, gas and a pretty lethargic pet. We did some more research and decided to try Nature's Variety, the result was shocking! Our BMD had ZERO gastric upset during transition and became energetic again. Nature's Variety has produced nearly half the stools, which are small compact and virtually odorless. He has NO gas and his coat is shiny and feels conditioned. People are noticing the change and we couldnt be happier. Add this to the fact that Amazon will ship it to my door with free super saver shipping! Oh, one last thing: The 15lb bags have a decent zipper to lock out air.<br /><br />Thank you for this quality food at a reasonable price."
"Jack Links is really good one of the bests and its actually real meat haha,I dont have to pay for it I get it for free because my dads company sells it and he gets free stuff from them all the time but if I didnt get it for free I would pay full price for it!"
"We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.  I would not have thought that ""salt and pepper"" would have been so incredibly heavy on the pepper.  Our mouths were burning and it wasn't a good burn!  We will continue to buy Popchips but never the salt and pepper variety again."
This is probably an excellent food.  But my cats just didn't seem excited by it.  Even the feral colony that I care for seemed unimpressed.
This coffee is wonderful. Turkish Coffee has a way of getting you all the flavor possible out of the beans and Natashas Cairo does not disappoint. I've tried some of the more mainstream Turkish Coffee's but Natashas is a step or two above the rest. If you like this try Natashas' Berber blend.
These were good except for the fact that they showed up as a solid block of chocolate instead of individual nuts.
oh boy!  I literally just got back from Pet Smart.. paid 9.99 for these.  Next time...I'll order them.
"I've been drinking Stash tea for years,once you try it,nothing else will do! I'm really pleased to be able to purchase Stash tea at Amazon"
"When I first started using Clear products for my hair, I noticed a distinct difference in the health of my hair. After about two months of usage, other people have started noticing and commenting as well that my hair seems healthier. That is important to keep in mind as I review this specific product.<br /><br />I have very fine hair. Any little thing will weigh it down. In fact, that's the one complaint I had about the first Clear product I reviewed (Strong Lengths) - I lost what little volume I had. I didn't want to lose the benefits of the sleek, shiny healthiness I found with Strong Lengths from Clear, so I tried the Strong Lengths shampoo and the Volumizing Root Boost conditioner together before switching to the volumizing shampoo. To be honest, I didn't seem much of a difference with that combination.<br /><br />Next, I switched to using both the volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I did see a difference in the volume of my hair, but it also became more fly-away and less sleek. That has made it a little harder to manage, especially with my new short cut. (I made the switch two weeks after I got my hair cut.)<br /><br />I really don't like to use other volumizing solutions other than a little hair spray. But, I think I would prefer those over the results I get from this volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I'm glad to have the set. I'm glad to have tried it. And, if I still had long hair I might even like it. But, with my current hair cut, I doubt I'll go out and buy this product. I have no qualms, however, about sticking to the Clear brand."
"I have been buying these Canidae treats for a while now for my dogs.  I feed them the same formula Canidae kibble and canned food, so these treats fit in well with their diet - no worry about upset tummies.  They smell kind of nice too, almost like cinnamon.  There is usually a good amount of crumbs at the bottom of the bag which I just sprinkle in their food bowls at dinner time.  I'll continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them."
"I've never had ""raw"" carob powder before, so I thought I would try this out. It's not bad. Since it is not roasted, it has a very mild flavor, and is less chocolate-like than the roasted Carob. So if you use Carob as a chocolate-substitute, you would probably find that this product is not what you want. But if you can appreciate Carob as a separate individual food, then it's worth a try. I thought the price was a bit high, though."
"Newman's Own Organic Ginger Snaps are loaded with ginger.  Both candied and ground ginger give these small hard cookies a real kick.  Taste is a mixture of wheat flower, sugar and molasses.  The ginger kick arrives late and mostly as an after taste.  For someone who likes ginger, this is a good thing.  Children may find this too overpowering and not care for these.  Nice to have on hand for a late night snack with a cold glass of milk for dunking."
We don't like plain iced tea but love Earl Grey Iced tea.  Love being able to order in large quantities since it takes several bags for each pitcher of tea.
"Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review. This coffee is much improved with the addition of cream. However, I got a very noticable hazlenut flavor from the coffee."
These are the best nuts ever and the value is best with the 6 pack.
"My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.  Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house!  Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!  It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar.  My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results."
This particular coffee is a bit strong for my taste. It was worth a try and you certainly get good amount of coffee for the money.
"I have been looking for a gluten good tasting gluten free cereal and now I have finally found it!!  It is not too sweet, has a great flavor."
"The BEST caffeine blast at the office when you don't want to drink coffee all day. No coffee breath, good for you and yummy!"
"I was looking for Mag Citrate in a fast-acting form that didn't taste terrible, and I found it in this product. I have a history of HypoMag including severe muscle spasms and prolonged charlie horses. I haven't had one charlie horse since starting on the mag...I am so thankful! Magnesium is a natural muscle relaxer and a vital mineral for bone and muscle health. I wish it was a little more affordable (because I have to use more of it than the average person) but I do plan to buy it again whenever possible."
"I really like the 5 hr Energy because it has no caffeine, no sugar and it works.  I like the fact that it has vitamins in it.  It helps get me over the last few hours of work when I start feeling sluggish."
"i usually order organic but did these by accident. still good ,everything is good from bob's."
"These were fine treats. I love that they are made in the USA. Despite their small size, the only problem is they are too hard for my 8 pound and 12 pound dogs to chew. Maybe if they came in a small chip form, it would be better for smaller dogs. Will look to see what other products this company has since it is American and not from CHINA!"
it is too sweet. It made me throw up. I love Korean gochujang but I don't like Annie Chun's gochunjang. Im so disappointed
"I can't believe it is sugar free!  Excellent!  Creamy... unbelievably good!  They sent me the wrong flavor....mint, but I like it."
"If I had paid the price that they are asking now plus shipping, I would have been disappointed. There is not enough good solid candy and the box is smaller than shown. However, it is a great idea, especially for older couples who really don't need anything, b/c they get a trip down memory lane. The rep. from the actual store was helpful in explaining that what I purchased was paid for by Amazon, when my pkg. did not arrive. And, Amazon customer service was excellent!! Buying it a lower price from Amazon and prime shipping made it a good gift!"
"I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.<br /><br />It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy."
I think PG tips are my favorite black tea. Its such a delicious tea. No wonder its Englands number one brand.
"This product came to my door from Amazon and when tasted it had small clumps in it, definitely something was wrong.  The product was within date, so I called Labrada and talked to their costumer service.  They told me that it was nothing to be alarmed, that it was due to the protein coming into contact with cold temperature, and it was probably caused during shipping.<br /><br />Labrada immediately shipped me out a brand new box and the new box was perfect.<br /><br />It's really nice when a company provides great customer service.  I was worried because I bought it off Amazon instead of a retail store, but they said that was fine and they would still honor their product."
"These protein bars are absolutely amazing.  I could eat these all day they are so tasty.  The best thing about them is that they have a WHEY protein blend and not a SOY protein blend, which makes them a more complete protein. Would I rather be eating chicken breasts...?  Yes, but when I am on the go, these are amazing!"
"David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Wasabi"" jelly beans will remind you of that wasabi paste or sauce that you find in sushi bars and is essential to Japanese cuisine.  These jelly beans won't clear your sinuses like the actual wasabi, but it will definitely remind you of wasabi.  I like different flavors like this because they're unusual and will get the attention of your guests if you put them out at a party.<br /><br />If you enjoy unusual flavors this flavor also comes in a mix called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a> that has other unusual flavors such as Chipotle, Thai Chili, Habenero and others.  These beans will wake up your taste buds!"
"My wife and I were looking for a cracker that would work with our Weight Watchers program. This one is our favorite. Large enough to handle any spread, cheese or meat. We first found these at Costco but when they ran out searched until we found them on Amazon. A great celebration when they arrived."
"Pros:<br />-  Packaging keeps portions noticeably fresher than cans.<br />-  Portions are (for my cats) ideal servings.  They are not large cats, but not kittens either.  Each pack seems to be just the right amount.  I no longer have opened, half full, cans of food sitting around that sometimes go to waste.<br />-  Dispensing into the bowl is a much more clean process than with cans.<br />-  Variety of flavors in each box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  Despite the Pros, I had to give it 3 stars because both of my cats (and a catfood eating dog, don't ask) will only eat the pouches that contain tuna.  That means 1/2 of the pouches seem to end up going to waste. I can remedy this by purchasing differently, but felt it was important since 3/3 pets agreed at my house.<br />-  If your cat is large, the portions will most likely be too small.<br /><br />Tip: Shake the pouch by holding it at the top before opening the top.  This pushes all of the juice down to the bottom of the pouch.  There is a chance when you rip it open that you'll get catfood juice on your hands if you don't."
"When my local co-op stopped carrying this product in bulk, I was nearly in despair.  In my opinion, this is the very best refried bean product you can ask for.  I often mix the prepared product with TVP, ground meat or sausage (""real"" or vegan) and salsa for a very tasty pseudo-Mex-curry type dish served over rice or tortillas.  The only draw-back is the sodium content, but I can live with it.<br /><br />This arrived in 3 individual plastic bags in one cardboard shipping box.  I'm very pleased and I hope Amazon keeps this configuration available."
I an a Starbucks loyal fan.<br />But this is just as dark and strong and on of it all...affordable!!!
Great product for the price.  They stayed fresh for a while and tasted very good!  I love that we can get the cheddar blast in a large container.
"Tofu burger is a yummy tasting way to add something extra to the tofu.  It adds flavor and texture to your tofu, which is quite pleasing to the palet.  The product easily mixes into the tofu.  Even using this product, I still add a little extra dried onion and garlic, or all spice.  However, I perfer things on the hot and spicey side."
"I have no clue why I hated beets as a kid and avoided them on the salad bar as an adult. I'm adding more veggies to my diet, broadening my horizon so beets were tried again. I like them, they're great plain or with a vinagarette and orange sections. In the past month I've ordered cut beets and now whole beets. These yummy little morsels are tastier than the cut ones to me. Like Sailor I've begun eating them out of the chilled can. I'm happy I've revisited beets."
"Didn't like this product very much. The first time I purchased the product, the seal was broken and everything was leaking out but the company did replace the product free of charge which made me feel better about the purchase. I don't think it is a bad product, but it just was not what I really was looking for."
Made my dog throw up immediately after eating.We tried the Bison Freeze dried.I threw it out the same day.Seems like too much garlic in it.
"As a first generation American I have visited family in Ireland for many years. I have always enjoyed Irish sausages daily while there, with Chef's Brown sauce of course, and a cup of Barry's gold tea. The amazing thing is now, thanks to the internet, I can have all three anytime I want. I have ordered Galtee's and Donnelly's before, but no brand, and I truly mean no brand, can compare to Tommy Maloney's. Throw them in a baking pan with a touch of olive oil in a 320' oven, turning frequenty, and you will get the most lovely, perfecty browned and tasty Irish sausage... just like they serve in Ireland. Morning or night, they never disappoint. Add a cup of strong Barry's Gold tea and you'll be transported instantly. Order Tommy Maloney's with confidence.<br />A McGovern from Cavan!"
Perfect cup of tea. The best tea I have had since leaving the UK to live in the US. Worth the effort to use leaves instead of a bag. It's become our daily drinker.
"When I drank from the first bottle, I wasn't really impressed, and thought it must have been hype. However, a few days later I drank some more and it seemed better.  It's refreshing, has no taste whatsoever, and is smooth.  Of course it is water, but it doesn't have that plastic taste some get from the plastic bottles.  I can't say anything as to its health claims, but it is good, and I would purchase in the future."
I was delighted to be able to buy this product that was pure and no sweeters added to it. It was exactly what I was looking for...a healthy drink! Very fast shipment also! I enjoy adding it to water....lasts longer.
THESE ARE GREAT. MY KIDS LOVE THEM AND THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME LOOKING AT THE ANIMALS. PLUS THEY ARE A MUCH HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER COOKIES! BUYING FROM AMAZON IS 1.00 CHEAPER THAN THE GROCERY STORE. I EVEN LIKE THEM. THE BAG DOESN'T STAY AROUND FOR TOO LONG THOUGH.
Why do some reviewers seem to expect Italian coffee house products in each and every product made for K-Cups?  This is a Very Nice Cappuccino / French Vanilla flavored drink.  It is well above what you find in some gas stations - and not as good as in some others.  Just because you get it in a gas station does not make it bad - go to Italy and find out.  This makes a very acceptable cup using the middle or lowest setting.  Remember - less is stronger.<br /><br />60 cal (40 fat)  --  4.5g fat sat  --  9 carb  --  5g sugar  --  0g fiber
I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed...its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular.
"This taffy is sweet enough, I would like a little more intensity in the flavors.  I was hoping for a tooth-friendly salt water taffy experience.  I'd be lying if I said it reminded me of salt water taffy.  However, my sons think it's pretty good and since they are the ones eating it, I'll give it their rating which is 4 stars.  For me, it's more of a 2.5 stars."
"I love this canned mocha! It is very chocolatey & I like the can size. It is a real pick me up this time of year. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.  But I agree with the 1st reviewer, there could be a bit less sugar."
Came in a large cake round.  A little goes a long way.  I love it hot or cold.  Has a  great taste to it as well.  I will purchase again.
Love these snacks. and the individual packages makes it easier to take on the go for a quick snack. I'm sure it amazing for school kids. But I loe it at work at my desk! :)
"Increasing food allergies have made it necessary to give up a lot of my childhood favorites. This is a close, but not exact, replica of Cocoa Krispies. The chocolate flavor is just a little bit flat."
"Didn't get to use any because the espresso machine I got didn't work. So I assume it works, but I gave it a 1 because I really don't know."
"I read the reviews before purchasing this item and its true its not as sweet as the company claims. One drop doesn't equal one packet of splendia regardless of which size you buy. It takes two drops to equal one packet even when you use the tiny size bottles.<br /><br />But I don't care!!!! It's awesome. NO CARBS!! I use it in my ice cream maker, in my coffee, cooking etc. I love this product and the price too. Plus, if you go to their Facebook page they have a 30% coupon which I used."
"MY BOY LOVED THEM..HE KEPT ON COMING BACK FOR MORE..I JUST WISH THEY HAD THEM IN A LARGER SIZE. MY PET IS A BIG GERMAN SHEPHARD, AND THESE ARE LIKE TINY FOR HIM, THAT HE GOES THRU THE BAG WITHIN 3-4 DAYS...HE LOVED THEM....THANK YOU...."
I've been hoping to find gluten free instant oatmeal and Glutenfreeda's Instant Oatmeal is the perfect answer.  It tastes and feels like non-GF instant oatmeal and it cooks like non-GF oatmeal. I am so pleased. I hardly ever ate oatmeal any more because other GF oatmeals took too long to prepare.  To have the option of buying it in large quantities in order to keep the cost down really sold me.  I'll be a repeat customer many times over.
"I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can break through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the ""jug"" is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been broken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn't fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy."
"I purchased the Organic Agave Nectar, but there are no ingredients on the package. I don't know if there is anything in there that is good for me, or at least not bad for me. I tried to find out the ingredients on the Honey Tree website, but there are no ingredients listed there either. The only contact information is for people who want to sell the product in their stores. The Domino brand that I bought last time has one ingredient listed and that is agave nectar. I know there must be some agave in the product, but how much?? Now I'm worried that this might just be 23 ounces of high fructose corn syrup and the rest is agave. It does taste good. That's why I gave it a star. I don't know if I want to consume this product: buyer beware."
"The downfall of these cookies are not the way they taste, but the way they are advertised. From the packaging, I expected a chewy cookie with a soft and, to use Nabisco's word, ""gooey"" chocolate center. Unfortunately, the cookies failed to meet my expectations.<br /><br />The actual cookie part was similar to what I expected. The outer portion tastes just like the normal chewy Chips Ahoy! cookies. However, I would not describe the center as gooey. Instead the chocolate center was closer to the consistency of chocolate that is just beginning to melt.<br /><br />While I would not say these cookies were necessarily bad, I certainly would not pick them over regular chewy Chips Ahoy!"
"My dog is a finicky eater, but with Chef Michael's she actually eats her whole bowl of food everyday which she never used to do, it is made with high quality ingredients, packaged really well and probably the best dog food we've come across so far."
"Order arrived quickly.  Great taste.  I've tried other more expensive brands, and this is my favorite.  Was glad it was shipped in glass jars vs. plastic ones, even though I didn't see that indicated in the item description."
"Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds was better to snack on than to eat as cereal with milk.  The taste is an acquired taste, and after you've eaten a few it starts to taste better.  It never tastes bad, it just tastes a little like cardboard until you get used to it.  All in all, I'd recommend this to people that are very health conscience and like foods like this, but this isn't something I will buy."
"I have 2 little guys and I cut the strips in half.  I tried the ones for small dogs...but they are pressed strips not chews. The dogs didn't care for them and they don't last but a minute.  I tried both the plain ones and the HEXtra Premium with Chlorhexidine.  They like both of them but I think prefer the taste of the ones with Chlorhexidine.  And, they don't cause the problems that the rawhide chews do...I recommend."
"I live out in the country so whenever I can buy in bulk, I do.  I froze what I couldn't use and it still is as good as the day I bought the product."
"My dogs love these treats - especially the Chicken flavor. They are small, but I find them to be perfect for training.  They are small, low in calories and of high quality so I don't feel bad about giving quite a few out when the dogs are working on learning new things or reinforcing good behavior.  The price on Amazon is much better than my local vendor and delivery is always fast.  Highly recommended."
I've had this flavor from the supermarket.  These are NOT supposed to be like bricks.  I threw out 11 of them.  I should've sent them back but I was too lazy.
"This stuff is great. Simple, gets the job done, no excess unnecessary crap. I usually mix it with milk and frozen strawberries and it tastes like perfection. Haven't tried it by itself or with water though, but i would imagine it was good with milk and gross with water."
"A crunchy delicious peanut butter cookie with chunks of chocolate buried throughout. Slightly crumbly but not dry. Perfect for the gluten free diet, kid or kid within. Enjoy"
"I got hooked on Japanese Curry when I was on my mission in Japan.  I love the stuff, but I have always had a hard time finding a place to buy it.  I don't like paying more for the small boxes at the super market, and there aren't any markets that carry this close to me.  I'd looked on Amazon before, but they didn't carry it then.  I hope they continue to carry this Curry now.  I love that they ship it right too me, and it still costs about the same per box as when I would go to the Asian Market back in my home town of Eugene."
Used to get this all the time but can no longer find it in grocery stores. Use it on all poultry and some sea food. Comes in a big can that will last you a while. Need the steak magic next !
"We have used this product for years and drink it almost exclusively. When our local stores quit carrying it, we were fortunate to find it here.  Wonder just how much we have drank over the past 15 years or so? Everyone we offer it to also is surprised at how good it tastes."
I'm new to the tea drinking world so I thought a sampler pack would have a wider flavor range. This sampler all taste pretty much the same.
Perfect training treat for our lab. He loves them and they are tiny so I don't worry about over feeding him.
"I wanted a sugar splurge but I chose these Shortbreads by mistake... Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Glucono Delta-lactone, Artificial Vanillin and Artificial Butter Flavors... Yuck! If Amazon won't take them back, I'll have to throw them out."
"We add tablespoons of this fragrant oil to our morning smoothies. You can saute and fry with this oil, but it is very fragrant, so be careful of what you use it on.  If you are looking for a non fragrant oil, try Tropical Traditions, it is the very best.  I also use the oil as a moisturizer, and to wash my face.  We put some in our pets food, and I have used it to treat ear mites in our cats. I order using subscribe and save, and it is very economical."
"I had high hopes for this mix but ended up being not too happy with it. The sunflower seeds had a bitter flavor that could have been offset by more dried fruit, but there wasn't enough fruit to counterbalance it. Tasted fresh and was a pretty good afternoon snack, but I wish the flavor had been better."
the coffee is shipped in 4 boxes each pod is wrapped for freshness the cup of coffee tastes real good I do not add sugar or cream so I know its a good cup of coffee
"I LOVE this delicious coffee.  It is full-bodied but not bitter or acidic, plus it is wonderfully aromatic.  It's become one of my three favorites k-cups (along with Timothy's Italian Blend and, for those decaf evenings, Gloria Jean's Special Blend Decaf)."
"I don't know what effects I will experience, however, it tastes good.  It arrived promptly, and I received two 32 ounce jars.  I add it  to my coffee each morning, and it gives the coffee a very nice rich flavor.  I use it on my arms, my legs, my feet.  It makes my skin soft, and in particular, my feet feels less dry even after just one application.  I think it is better then the moisturing lotions you find in the stores.  Amazing, that you can eat this stuff and use it for skincare too."
"OK - this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the ""club"" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience."
"Once you get them it's hard to quit! Then again they are fat free.<br /><br />My order came quickly and very fresh vs the overpriced candy stores where they're in a bin and you don't know how long they've been sitting there, or spending almost $2 for 5 ounces. Great deal right now, and with 2 bags, you get free shipping! I got regular gummi bears and cola bottles, and I think my husband ate more of them than I did and he isn't a big gummi fan! He said they were just good, fresh, and had a great flavorful taste, not like any other gummis that are just colored shaped goo."
This is the first time I have seen gluten-free rice krispies. Being gluten-free is not an easy task and some of the foods are almost not palatable so to find something that both looks and tastes good really helps a person with Celiac disease. Loved them.
"I love the south beach s'mores but have not been able to find them so tried these.  They are OK, sort of taste like peanut butter toast but not bad and healthier.  Filling when in a big hurry."
"Nice cup of coffee, enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. Worth a try, and at a good price."
"We use this product to sprinkle over the front lawn to prevent dogs from doing their business.  Quite successful for that purpose.  Oh, and it is tasty if you add it to your food.  LOL!!"
"I found the gum to be very good and knowing that it didn't have aspertame in it was great! The flavor could have lasted a bit longer than it did and I was hoping it would be a little mintier tasting. But considering that there is no other gum that is sugar free and doesn't have aspertame in it that I know of I would buy this gum. I also think that the price is too high, so I will wait till it goes down before I start chewing it regularly."
"Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard.  I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price."
"I ordered these for a ""candy stash"" at work that a few coworkers and I dip into during the day. These are a hit. I prefer suckers to keep me from snacking at my desk during downtime, and these are my new favorites. 3 suckers = 70 calories. Each sucker has 100% Vitamin C, so I can delude myself into thinking my candy is good for me (although, it beats the vending machine choices every time)!<br /><br />The flavors are friggin delicious. I only wish there were more flavors/vitamin pops to choose from. Wish I could take all my vitamins this way."
"I really should have read the dimensions, it is really small and it looks like someone cut a branch off a bush. I hope it stays alive. I had one I bought from a road side vendor that was like this one and it died in a month. I had one from a florist that lived for years. I was hoping for better quality."
"I'm not a huge sweets fan, prefer chips and such normally, but every once in a while, like just about everyone, a sweet tooth bites me and I want something with some sugar in it.<br /><br />Having grown up in a family known for baking (grandmother used to make wedding cakes profesionally), cookies are nothing new.  And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.  A little squishier than I'd normally want, but these are supposed to be gooey after all, so that comes with the territory.<br /><br />And while the picture on the package shows something with just oodles of chocolate in the middle, while I think everyone knows it's a given that the picture is an exaggeration, I have to say it's not exaggerating by MUCH...  There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.<br /><br />But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.<br /><br />Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.<br /><br />They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.<br /><br />If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options."
"All 3 of my dogs-pom, yorkie, rat terrier, love these. I just received my 2nd order. Wish these were on sub. and save."
"This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try."
"The only drawback to receiving only one packet is that it does not include the dietary information that I expected.  It tastes good and, at the same time, I would have liked information to determine if this would fit well with my health plan.  Without this information, I would be reluctant to order more."
"These are good chips! Maybe not as tasty as some other unhealthy chips, but I would definitely buy them again."
"Ok, for me, this needs to be sweetened and mixed with milk (vanilla soymilk or dark chocolate almond milk are awesome), but it's actually not a bad thing having a serving of good (strong but not bitter or burnt-tasting) coffee in the refrigerator ready to grab. I mixed it with the amount and type of milk I wanted, sweetened it as I pleased, and yumminess happened, my way; I like that. There is a lot of coffee out there that tastes nasty to me, but this is the good stuff."
This jerky has been by far the saltiest I have ever had. I actually like salt but to a certain point and this went way beyond it. My favorite jerky was the World Kitchens brand brown sugar but it's no longer available. Unless you really like your food Extra Salty I would stay away. as far as tenderness I'll give it a 7 out of 10.
"I got this for a friend that likes japanese candies. I myself have tried it, and it was a nice treat. First off, this fascinating ramune soda candy is in a small plastic bottle that is reminiscent of a ramune soda drink bottle(minus the marble and glass bottle), and it is about half the size of one as well. The candy is in the shape of pellets and sort of tastes like ramune, but the taste could also be similar to Smarties or Wonka Fun Dip candy sticks in pellet form. Nonetheless a great candy."
"Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.  I drink the first mug straight and the rest I put soy milk powder in.  GOOD STUFF.  Will continue to buy this tea."
"From my 3 cat's point of view these are the best treats they have ever tasted (and they have tasted many types).  The cats keep wanting more and more.  I have to hide the packet.  If your cats like what my cats like, they will love these.  The extra cost is well worth it to see your cats enjoy these treats.  I should have known they would love them because their all time favorite regular dry cat food is The Goodlife Recipe Indoor (made with Real Chicken, Brown Rice & Garden Greens) food."
Great quality service and product every time !! Everyone should try Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuccino cups.  The option for the 3 pack 18 count best fits my lifestyle.
"We recently recieved 2 samples of the 5-Hour Energy and my Husband and my Son inlaw used them the next morning. They had both just gotten off from working night shift, my son in law a 8-10hr shift and my hubby a 12hr shift. They had to work on the car so both took the 5-Hour energy shots and were up all day. Not only did it give them the energy to stay awake and alert enough to fix the car, they also fixed the mower, built on a clubhouse for the kids and cut up a fallen treee in the yard. So in my oppinion the 5-Hour Energy is well worth the cost, and I would buy and use them again. ""I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."""
"I have a Nespresso C100 and use the Ristretto capsules. Ordered these as I like the concept of 'ethical coffee.' Huge disappointment. I find the coffee is weak and not like espresso at all. Plus, the aftertaste has a bitter quality to it. The crema is thin with no richness. Overall, a poor substitute. If you like your Nespresso, you can try these but beware, you are not getting the same product."
"The best cheese curl we've found, but we stopped looking once we found these!  Did not think we could consume a case - but, we've back for more."
"Happy with Dog Food, and our dogs like it too!  The food is made of healthy ingredients and is especially good for one dog of ours who has skin allergies, and there are many ingredients he can't tolerate.  I've found the 26 lb. bag to be the best price.<br /> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SUVR5W"">Wellness Simple Solutions Dog Food, Rice and Salmon Formula, 10-Pound and 8-Ounce Bag</a>"
"When I was a kid, Cadbury (IIRC) made a very dense gummy like roll of candy.  This comes very very close.  The flavors are not too strong which is good and the texture is very firm/dense like very old gummy bears.  I love this chewy texture!!!  For a box for $10 shipped?  WIN!  (wait until it is Amazon Prime eligible)."
I thoroughly enjoy this product.  It mixes well with hardly any residue in the bottom of your cup and has excellent flavor.  A wonderful alternative to coffee!
"The first time I had tuna cooked in the can without added water or oil was a place in Eureka, Ca a few years back...I've never had it since until I found this brand.  This is ONLY tuna, nothing added.  When you open the can (with an easy pull-top), you use all of the tuna and the juices, it's really delicious.  I am a big tuna eater and this is excellent tuna at an affordable price.  Upon opening the can you will notice a whole piece of tuna, never flakes or chuncks, and you can break this tuna 'steak' apart depending on how big of chunks you want, or leave it whole on your plate.  No matter how you use it, it's really good eating.  It's moist and has a big flavor, an excellent choice for your tuna sandwiches or salads.  I stocked up on about 10 orders so my pantry will be full and I can eat this to my heart's content...and what a healthy heart it will be with the high levels of Omega 3!  Low mercury because they use smaller fish.  I hope the price and quality never change. $16.62 for 6 cans."
"The plain RiceSelect couscous is delicious, easy, and quick to prepare.  It is great as a side item or the base of a main course.  So far, I have not found a bad product from RiceSelect."
I saw this kind bar on amazon and bought it to try. I had high expectations that were dashed the minute I tasted the first bite. The mixture of the mango and macadamia do not go well together. I was very disappointed.
"Normally I prefer plain chips, even though I don't eat them often. The chili lime is pretty good, great with some guacamole. These chips are very crisp, with a strong potato flavor, but also have a slightly burnt taste."
This product has helped me break free from the peanut butter habit!!!  It tastes so good!!!  Thank you PB2!  I put it on yogurt and add it to my oatmeal.  It keeps me totally satisfied for hours.  I just ordered my second package with chocolate and regular.  It's a great way to get protein.  Wonderful product!!!
"Our water is medium hard (between 120 and 150 mg/l according to the data from our municipal supplier -- Bolton Point Water System near Ithaca NY -- data is available on the web). It doesn't take long for glassware to get cloudy gray film on it. We were seriously thinking about putting in a water softener to deal with this but decided to give this citric acid a try. Well, running those glasses through the dishwasher just once (with one tablespoon of citric acid and the rest Cascade Complete) took about 75% of the film off and after one more pass it was totally gone. Talk about sparklying glassware --- amazing, just about beyond belief."
"They should really put the origin of the product in the information. It is from Thailand. I was drinking the Jasmine tea from Ito En and noticed it was from Thailand so I switched to this one. Well, what a suprise. It too is from Thailand. No Thanks."
My daughter loves this stuff. Convent to toss into the diaper bag and great for the earthquake kit. When I have this in stock (My wife goes through this stuff pretty quickly) we usually give this to our (now) 3 month old right before her nap or when she's supposed to go to sleep. It's a little thicker than the powder stuff so it fills her tummy pretty well. I have also noticed she doesn't spit up that much when we use this stuff.
"I LOVE these pretzel crisps.  Lots of flavor, low in fat.  Baked, not fried.  I get these for around $3.50 per 7.2 oz bag at my local grocery store, so I'm a little confused by the astronomical prices shown by the current people selling them on Amazon.  They are well worth it if you find them for less than $4 per bag.  YUM!"
"I would like have more of a kick, but it's a lot better than most Keurig and superior to our local Dunkin Donuts fresh brew. Dunkin's K-cup is not in the same ballpark."
"I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great."
"No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book.  So why only two stars?  Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4ARBE"">Sweet N' Spicy</a> flavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again."
"I tried this after having tried many chocolate/raspberry blends. Oh my! this is my favorite, perfect blend of the two flavors in a warm comforting cup. My husband who loves the GM wild blueberry says this is his new favorite! Thank goodness you get 48 cups in the order!! : )"
"What a horrible Disappointment!!! I bought these shells and they all broke into pieces before they were even cooked (in fact they still had a hard gummy texture not even close to done and I do like my pasta al dente,so they really weren't done). A bad product and a waste of money. Do not buy these!!"
"I got these when Amazon was running a very good promotion, so it worked out to something like .60 a bar.  These have a really nice, tangy taste (the cherries) and a really satisfying chewy texture. I like that it's pretty natural and simple ingredients (grounds nuts, cherry, dates etc.), but for my preference, it's a bit too high in fat.  I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat."
"Love this.  Great substitute for shortening.  Keeps baked goods moister, and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables."
"I love Vegeta, it is a must for my cooking.  It's great in soups and all sorts of sauces.  You can even make your own veggie stock out of it.  I would highly recommend it."
"I was very pleased with my order of the Lake Grassmer Sea Salt. The product is terrific, very tasty. But what really impressed me was the wonderful way it was packed by the seller and the very very fast shipping. I would recommend this product and seller to everyone. I will be ordering from them again."
"want to jazz up your meat or vegetables? then this is a must have! sweet yet tangy, a little spice yet just right!"
I love Pamela's products. This product is awesome as so is all her products. I just ordered Pamela's baking mix and bread mix  the other day and it just showed up yesterday and all 6 bags in two separate boxes had two small puncture holes in all the bags in the same spot. The holes had to have been made at Pamela's packaging warehouse because they were packaged in Pamela's shipping boxes. I called amazon and reported it to them and they were very nice and refunded my money.I would have given this product a five star but for the packaging issue from Pamela's i gave it three stars.
"A Texas transplant to Maryland, it has been hard to find good chili mix at the grocery store.  For a brief and wonderful year, my local store carried my favorite, Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili Kit.  Then they restocked with this stuff.  While it appears to be made by the same folks, it's AWFUL.  They've left out the onions, there's almost no cayenne pepper (they say to make it hot add the whole package, I would have needed about a half dozen of their little packages to even touch hot!), and the herbs and spices are all mixed together so there's not real sense of how much of anything you're putting in.  No problem if it's good, but since it's not...  It appears that they've upped the chili powder quotient and backed off on everythign else.  If you like chili, don't bother with this stuff!"
"I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to break by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one.  Another new toy, doomed to failure.  &lt;sigh>  oh well, at least I tried."
"Best combination of price and taste, plus it's organic.  Matcha tea can be very expensive, but this stuff is high quality and a reasonable price.  Two thumbs up, very highly recommended!"
I've worked in a few Coffee houses and this is the worst crap I've come a crossed. It taste like tree bark ...their is no coffee oil left in this CRAP..............JUST buy Folgers before you buy this blue mountain crap coffee..I wish I could get my $$$$$ back don't EVEN BUY>>>>>>>>>>>>> -1 vote
This is a Good product if eaten quickly. the taste was excellent. I was a little surprised at the quickness and totality of the mold that set in.  It is good if you eat all of it in 4 -5 days.
"My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)"
"These meat snacks are fabulous and incredibly healthy.  I first discovered them at my health club in New Hampshire, where they charge $2.50 for one stick, so buying them from Amazon made sense, cutting the cost by a buck.  Try all the flavors - they're all great, and very low in fat with lots of fiber.  Highly recommend."
"This particular brand and blend of Green Mountain coffee is one of the best I have ever tasted or enjoyed.  Its got a nice body, is NOT bitter, and goes down very smoothly.  Would recommend to any coffee drinkers for their morning fix to get moving."
"When you want to really taste the perfect balance of lemon and quinine, this is your beverage.  Also, it is highly carbonated which means that when poured over ice with gin or vodka, it has the perfect amount of bubbles.  Not so highly carbonated you can't drink it straight from the bottle.  Or, as I like to say, ""perfect.""<br /><br />I have had four different brands of bitter lemon and none of the others compare to Fever Tree.<br /><br />Also, I haven't gotten malaria."
I love that my son is learning to feed himself with these healthy snacks that he loves!
"This product is steeped in water to make a tea or drink that is something like a fruit punch.  This 2-lb bag is economical and the flowers (actually a calyx, I think, if you want to be technical) are clean and fresh.  A relative of mine uses the drink for medicinal purposes and has had good results with it.  One caveat:  It stains badly if you spill it so it's best to keep it away from any heirloom tablecloths you may have."
"These are great chips, low in fat, high in potassium. When I had difficulty finding them in Publix, I cheched out Amazon.com. Happy that I did. Not only is it more convenient, but less expensive, also!"
"These were good, but I really couldn't taste the A1 in them.  Tasted similar to the original steak nuggets to me"
Box arrived in great shape. The cookies are easy to make and they taste great!! They were fresh and scrumptious.
"My picky little 5 1/2 lb toy poodle would 'KILL' to get to these treats!!  The chicken wrapped banana and the chicken wrapped sweet potato by Dogswell are pure heaven for her.  If I let her, that is all she would eat!!  I have Amazon just send me both treats on a regular basis.....it's so much easier that way."
This is a great tasting product for 100calories and you actually get quite a few chips in the bag. Salt and vinegar are my favorites. The plain taste like Munchos. Will definitely buy again!
This fly trap is not worth the money.  It doesn't do the job at all.  The ones I bought else where were much better.  Don't buy them.  There are much better ones out there.
"my experience with "" Omaha"" it is very good, the product is excellent, good packing, fresh and delicious, I have sent to relatives in other states and were enchanted. I am very happy!"
Very pleased to finally find a real candy store. Very fast. We'll be back for more soon and thanks again.
"I've been drinking coconut water for years and I've tried them all ONE, Vita Coco, Naked, etc.. Zico was my favorite until this recent change where they added a new ingredient called ""natural flavor"". It use to be be pure coco water but the new ingredient change the taste for me. This was one of the highest reviewed coco waters on Amazon before this change...what a pity...<br />I'm dropping Zico from my auto-ship and going back to something that doesn't have artificial ""natural flavor"" added to what should be pure coco water."
Excellent I needed a dog food without copper as an ingredient and found Newmansbon the Internet. It has proven to be a great choice and my dog had thrived
"Surprisingly mellow coffee with a lingering, embracing aroma that impressed my snobby visitors from England.  I recommend this for your snooty friends."
"I love this one, too.. hard to find any ramens that don't have meat in them.. making these reviews is making me hungry and wanting to order some of these.. lol :o)  Onions are good for you."
"I'm really fond of this chai. I like a lot of chais, but this one is unique with the blend of red and decaf black tea, sweetened with coconut. It forgives a long steep or a wide range of temperatures (though hotter temps bring out better flavor), and I find the blend of flavors quite nice, particularly for such an inexpensive brand of tea.<br /><br />As with most chais, this tea is not at all bitter."
Those are very good for satisfying late night sugar cravings without the guilt. will order more when i finish this pack for sure
"Great, natural product for the dogs.  They think they are eating candy, but really are eating a wholesome snack food."
"The product is well presented very well desgned and the teas are very good and I srongly recommend them, I am sure that you will love them even if you are not a tea lover"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EXMP74"">Knorr/Lipton Rice Sides, Herb & Butter, 5.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br />  A long time ago you had a very very good product that was known as herb & butter rice ( NO SIDES-pasta), and it could be used alone or to be mixed with ground meat, bell peppers,& tomatoes to create unstuffed bell peppers.  Then some one decided to IMPROVE!!? the mix by adding pasta, and it is just not as good, but it is the only way I can get the rice that I like.  PLEASE PLEASE go back to the pastaless rice.  Thanks in advance"
"I was shocked to see this.  Maybe I've misunderstood what they are selling here, but I don't think so.  Locally I can buy a box like this that has 36 1.5 oz bags for $7.80.  I gave this 3 stars because the product is great, but the price is extremely high ($22.97 at posting)."
"This is my go-to drink when I feel like drinking something refreshing on a hot summer day.  I am not a huge fan of strongly flavored tea drinks, but I really enjoy this one because of the mango component.  It achieves a good balance of sweetness and tea flavor; one does not overpower the other.  I was worried that this drink might taste too much like their ""Mucho Mango"" beverage (which is far too sweet for me), but was pleasantly surprised when its wasn't nearly as strong.  The price point is unbeatable and the tea is delicious!"
"I have a beagle with bad food allergies, I started a different limited ingredient food and she still had loose stools so I decided to give taste of the wild pacific stream a try. She has no more loose stools and its only been 2 weeks now. This is the first food I tried that helped with that. I can't say how good otherwise because its only been 2 weeks now, but so far so good and I called the company and they do guarantee that it is ethoxyquin free. It is also one of the top foods on dog food analysis. Since she is a beagle and only 25 pounds, I am pleased with the protein amount for a dog her size. The last food she was on was lower protein and some are to high for her size. I made sure this food was ethoxyquin free before I purchased it. She loves it. This is the first time in a year that her stools are formed, and not very loose. I am having her allergy tested in 2 weeks so I will know if its ok for her to stay on this food but so far eliminating grains for her has been great. I won't know the full effect until a few months as far as the itchiness and biting her feet, but so far this is helping her a lot. I will give an update once she is on it longer. I have tried quite a few other limited ingredient foods and allergy formulas and she would vomit and have a ton of itching, but this one she tolerated right away and I weaned her slowly. She is very sensitive to foods."
"Amazing --both  my Senior dog and the new pup loves these. Quality ingredients---will break in half easily for a really small puppy.<br /><br />I've re-ordered more than once--always very fresh ""use by "" dates.<br /><br />QUALITY--"
"Bold tasting coffee, not for someone that dosent like a strong tasting coffee. I have bought this coffee a few time and I really like it."
"The ""Turkey"" snack sticks are very good.<br />I do not normally like meat sticks.<br />I was surprised to find that I liked these.<br />Listed Ingredients does not list MSG and states the casing is gluten free."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013C2L6"">Rocky Mountain Chocolate Tower</a><br /><br />This package arrived today and I am debating telling the sender how bad it was.  Mostly packaging.  The chocolates tasted stale.  A few nuts..."
Thank you so much for sending us this product that our dogs love so much! It was neatly packaged and enjoyed by the dogs the minute we opened the package. The deal is amazing!
"My rottweiler-mix loves these treats!  Each morsel is about the size of your pinky fingernail, so these treats are perfect for training.  It's a struggle to keep my big girl svelte.  I don't have to break the treats in half, and I can give her these treats  without worrying that she'll turn into a sausage.  Because she likes them so much, I never feel like I'm depriving her.  The bag is re-sealable and keeps the treats soft.  If the treats happen to dry out, just put a moist paper towel in the bag, and they will re-absorb the moisture."
Just right to heat up for Chili Dogs or to make queso dip. Love the fact I do not have to pick out the beans as I did with other chili. Find it even mixes well into a pot of Mac n Cheese.<br />Reorder when running low.
"I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!"
"Im not sold on using this as a peanut butter substitute (like for PBJ sandwich or dipping crackers or celery), but it is rock solid for recipes.  I like that I can get full blown peanut butter flavor in recipes (cookies, smoothies, cakes, pie, pancakes, ice cream, etc.) without the 200 calories of actual peanut butter.  The PB2 website has hundreds of recipes to use this with.  I check their site all the time for fun uses of PB2.<br /><br />As for making actual peanut butter (e.g. mixing the powder with water), I did not like it and wont use it for that."
"I've used this item for stunning drink presentations but have routinely been entertaining ""self"" at home.  The syrup's amazing and the flower is edible.  The flower stuns everyone at first but when they taste, they thoroughly enjoy.  I have purchased this a number of times.  Amazon use to carry the larger, 11 oz. jar but I did not see it on this last purchase.  This product's become a staple in my house. I also use the syrup to mix with other items (fruit dips, desserts, ice cream, etc.)"
"I have had problems going to sleep for most of my adult life, so any time I see something that isn't a sleeping pill to try out, I try it.  I was surprised that this stuff actually worked - I've used it a number of times, and it has been consistently effective at helping me fall asleep.  Very happy with this product."
"Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as ""reviews,"" rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a ""this is not a review"" button as opposed to just ""helpful,"" ""not helpful,"" and ""abuse.""  (We can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually HOT.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.  If you think it's a five star salsa with 2 star shipping... the proper rating is FIVE STARS.  Not four, not three, but five.  Save your shipping complaints for the SHIPPER.  It's only fair."
Amazon has put together the perfect coffee at a great price.We find that we can  enjoy our favorite cup of Carabu Blend anytime without breaking our budget.Thanks Amazon !  Duane&Sue
"These macaroons are amazing.  I do not know why the other reviewers said they weren't very sweet.  I think they are plenty sweet and delicious.  If you love coconut, you MUST try these.  Buy them now!"
"I am not one of the super picky coffee people out there.  Before my favorite coffee was from Starbucks, the Caramel Machiato.  But I absolutely LOVE this coffee.  I don't really care that it is instant, because I think it tastes really good.  My favorite thing is that on the medium Keurig setting I do not have to do a thing to it to enjoy it.  No sugar, no cream, no nothing.  Just pop the K-cup in, hit the button and enjoy.  If you are not a really big coffee snob and like sweet flavored coffees you might love this one, I do."
"Sencha is a more pricy green tea, with distinct aroma and smoothness I like.  Well, this tea was a great deal but didn't live up to expectation.  I thought it didn't smell or taste like fresh Sencha.  Onward with my search for affordable but quality Sencha green tea."
"I'll let these crackers speak for themselves (they're the best if you like rice crackers - as far as I can tell, these particular crackers are the ideal platform for high quality cheddar).  Needless to say, this is a great deal - two bucks a box with free shipping.  Can't go wrong here, since I recently saw (and yes, bought) these same crackers at the local grocery store for nearly four bucks.  Buy some, but make sure you leave some for me."
"Some people thing those who like this BBQ sauce must be the devil...I'm not the devil, not even a devil, but I sure love this Cattlemen's Kansas City Classic BBQ sauce.  If you like BBQ sauce with some tang and a great flavor, then this BBQ sauce is a winner for all those devil-may-care people."
"I have been using this product for 6 years on my toy yorkie. Initially it helped him get rid of dry, itchy skin and continued use has kept it away.<br />It also smells great and keeps him clean for a long time, so less bathing is needed which further helps with the dry skin, especially in winter. Many pet shampoo's resemble laundry detergent, but not this one. It's the only shampoo I use, with great results."
It does what it says it will--it holds k-cups and does a fine job of it.  It spins.  That's about all I can say.  It hasn't dropped any coffee that I know of.  It hasn't fallen apart.  Two big plusses in my book.
"Very Stale, i had a leftover jellybean from a previous purchase/seller that i crushed in my finger in comparison with these and they are definatly VERY stale if not fake not to mention most are smushed and look like blue candlewax and sugar. at least they came in 2 days right?"
"Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!"
"Seems to help, I sleep well and if I do wake up I'm not long getting back to sleep.<br />I ordered two boxes and I'm about to buy two more."
"Firstly...I want to qualify that Maxwell House is the only coffee we ever use and we love it. I will also say that these bags are part regular and part instant coffee. If you are not an instant coffee drinker these may not be your first choice. I purchased Maxwell House Coffee Singles,  with continuous  bi-monthly shipments, for a coffee machine we purchased. It was a single serve machine and when it arrived the bags did not work with that specific machine. Amazon was amazing about refunding my purchase instantly and cancelled my monthly delivery program exactly as stated in the agreement. I have shopped with Amazon for years and this is the first time I requested a refund and they handled it seamlessly. Thank you very much.<br />Truly,<br />Vivian"
"These are awesome!  I find them great as a salad topping as well as an afternoon pick me up.  Flavor is sweet, but not too sugary."
"I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos."
This product doesn't have unnecessary things. It is only plant sterols and magnesium stearate in gelatin capsules. It could be cheaper but it's a fair price. It works for me for my prostate problems.
"I have always loved the Garden of Eatin' Chili-Lime chips, but these are a close second.  I also ordered the Nacho (which my kids like, but I can't eat).<br /><br />Anyway, the Guacamole chips are a great snack for long drives, but it is too easy to eat the whole bag full!"
"When i got this coffee,i discovered it was for a single cup machine.I dont have one so i just cut the packets open and used the coffee in my drip machine.It worked just fine.I only used two packets for a half a pot and it was still strong so i think a little more water and it would be fine.The coffee is very good.I felt it was very smooth and had a nice aroma.I didnt realize that the name Marley is the family of Bob Marley.Im a fan so it made it even better.Good stuff,mon,try it."
"Good concept to keep our puppy entertained.  Quality is alright, but we do not leave it out for her, as she can easily chew the plastic apart."
"I recently discovered Popchips and their greatness. So I have been trying them out flavor by flavor. The Chili Lime has is now my favorite. It had previously been the Salt & Pepper. It is def not too spicy, so don't let that scare you. If anything the lime is the highest note of flavor. If you already like Popchips, this is a new great flavor to try. If you have never tried them, then this is a great flavor to start with."
"This offering is very misleading. A 2.2lb bag is NEVER $33.00, and the discount advertised here is WAY overblown. Beware - this is not a large bag (as I thought it was with the price). The ""list price"" and the ""discount"" are very very very very misleading."
"for a store bought product, this is not a bad choice, my cat seems to like it, at least for now...LOL thanks."
I bought this catnip online along with a toy that also came with catnip. Well I tried the catnip that came with the toy and my cat didn't even notice it. Then I pulled out the organc stuff and my cat tried to claw the bag open. This is when I realized organic truly does make a difference.
"In my opinion, this is the best goat cheese made anywhere in the world. It's firm but not too dry and retains the delicate sweetness of goat's milk. I could eat it three meals a day."
"Rice Thins are crunchy and delicious wafers that go perfect with the filling of your choice for a great 'sandwich' alternative to bread. They are also very low in calories, too. Give them a try and you will find they become a staple in your kitchen."
"I have been drinking Melitta Lite for about 5 years.  It is far tastier than any of the other Lite or Half Caffeine Coffees out there.  My preference in coffees is medium to strong brew; my coffee should taste like coffee. Melitta Lite certainly does have the body of a good coffee while being gentler to my tummy and my nerves.<br />Good thing that Amazon sells this in the subscription program, so it is delivered right to my door and I always have some on hand."
"Folger's scores another coup with their awesome French Vanilla ground coffee. The taste is delicious. It keeps a long time in your kitchen cabinet or your freezer, too. If you do choose to keep it in your freezer, however, remember to let it thaw out a few hours before using.<br /><br />The canisters are very well constructed to keep the ground coffee fresh and the safety seal on the top of each unused canister gives you peace of mind. The packaging overall is excellent.<br /><br />But of course it's the coffee that we're really interested in here. The freshness of that distinct French Vanilla flavor strikes your taste buds and makes you really, REALLY want that second cup of coffee. It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning; and of course it's good at any time of the day or night as well.<br /><br />Obviously, coffee contains caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine in any way you might prefer to drink decaffeinated coffee instead of this product. If you have any questions at all about your specific medical situation consult your doctor.<br /><br />There's only one minor disappointment: the label says that this coffee contains ""added natural and artificial flavors."" I wish that Folger's had told us exactly what these ingredients are. That way people could make an even more informed decision about whether or not they would want to drink this coffee. I am taking off one star for this to make this a four star review. I truly believe in ingredient labels that tell what ALL the ingredients are and not just some of them.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is one great French Vanilla coffee. If you love French Vanilla flavored coffee you can't go wrong with the Folger's brand. If you like your coffee even a bit sweeter you can always add sugar or any sugar substitute.<br /><br />Vive la France!"
"We purchase this tea primarily for keeping our fridge well stocked with iced tea year round, and for that it is really quite tasty.  This particular brand/blend really seems to emphasize the fruitiness of the bergamot -- it's oddly reminiscent of lychee, which we rather like.  The ""black""ness, however, is quite mild, so if I'm drinking it hot I brew it a bit longer and it still comes out pretty well."
"These beans are great! I use them to make my own extract, and the flavor is excellent! I would highly recommend these beans for any kind of cooking use."
"We ordered the Almond Apricot, Almond Coconut, and the Mango Macadamia.<br /> We actually liked them in the order listed.<br /> I think we will only order Almond Apricot again.<br />They were good!"
"What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn't that enough?<br /><br />Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology. All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru's just sitting around thinking, ""what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?""<br /><br />This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that's right, ""filed""), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has ""purifying grains"", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says ""body and face"" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars. Improvement idea would be to make an all-in-one product so I don't have to spend longer in the shower or use two products to get clean."
"Just not the normal flavors I am used to getting. The red ones are hot and spicy like the cinnamon candies. So if you like those and like gum this would be perfect for you. The pink, orange, and yellow dont have a great flavor. I really like the green ones."
I got the product I wanted in a nice time plus free samples of similar products!  Thanks! Now if only my boyfriend didn't drink it all...
$42 for a 3 pack???  You can currently get these on the website for America's Largest Retailer in a 2 pack for $18.  The pricing on this coffee has been getting more and more ridiculous over the last two years.
"I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans."
I enjoyed these ginger snaps since they were crunchy with a strong flavor of candied ginger without being harsh. As I chewed them  I felt and tasted the tiny bits of candied ginger.  I describe myself as having a liking for strong and spicy flavors.  Some may find these cookies too spicy but if you can take a bit of heat these ginger snaps will be a  good choice for you. I received them through the Amazon Vine program and would try them again.
"I eagearly opend the box from Amazon, and was disappointed in that I thought they were in the shell...oh well I can give them as gifts..."
"I ordered these after trying a couple other brands (including Hapi).  While I was very unimpressed with the quality and taste of the Hapi brand, these were terrific.  They had lots of wasabi flavor and plenty of crunch.  If you're a fan of wasabi peas, give these a try."
"have been looking in stores locally and could not find anymore, love their marinades use them on fish and chicken now also on fresh vegetables"
My dog loves this toy.  She can go thru a few of these in a day if we let her.  The only problem is that she figured out how to chew them off the toy in about 1 minute.  So we tend to go thru a lot of them.
"Came upon these bad boys in a vending machine, now I am an addict, thanks Herrs. They taste exactly like jalapeno popper, but puffs melt in your mouth. Herrs needs to work on distributors, cant find in store (Ohio), and shipping cost is ridiculus."
While the product is certainly easy to use (once you have figured out the awful instructions) you quickly realize that you can only make food in incredibly small amounts. As any mother knows there is no time for that. It is much simpler and quicker to simply steam your food then use a regular food processor. Please save your money and skip this product!!!!
"UPDATE: BUT 5 stars GO TO AMAZON WHO ISSUED A CREDIT FOR MY LAST ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT! GOOD WORK AND THANK YOU AMAZON, I AM IMPRESSED!!! -Mo<br />..........................................<br /><br />(change from 5 stars to 1) CANCEL THIS PRAISE OF THIS PRODUCT! It DOES contain BPA! -Mo<br />..........................................<br /><br />This is *great* fish; no BPA, no added salt (*I* choose what and if salt is added), I LOVE lots of eatable fish bones (top calcium availability), congratulations Crown Prince and thank you for canning fish I can eat without BPA!"
"These vegetables taste good but you can save the shipping cost and buy Birdseye.  Thre is not much difference between good frozen vegetables from your local mart and this product.  No local store within two or three hundred miles and you want really good vegetables, then order them."
"This fudge TASTED GREAT-but because it had ingredients not listed-corn syrup-I could not eat it so it just sits in my fridge.<br />I do not think it is fair to those if us trying to be careful of what we eat, to be misled-even when Amazon says ""ingredients may be different"". Alot of people avoid corn syrup, and it makes me angry this is probably why it was not listed."
The drink wasn't bad tasting and I did not notice a smell. Gave me energy I am sure because of the caffeine. It doesn't have as much caffeine as some other products out there...some products do not even tell you how much caffeine is their product-At least they are attempting to disclose how much caffeine is in their drink_ that is what I like about it the caffeine is low...I will try it gain like the chews or powder...
"No matter the flavor, my puppy loves Zuke's.  A little pricy, but I like her to have healthier treats.  They are pretty strong smelling, so I can only assume they taste pretty good."
This is a very nice extract. Tastes just like bubblegum when used properly. We use it to flavor meringue kisses and then reversed deep fried them in liquid nitrogen.
"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!"
"Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.  Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too."
"I've run across some old recipes that call for powdered vanilla.  I Googled powdered vanilla and came here 'cause this was the first entry.  Because people have been honest about the fact that this product is NOT powdered vanilla but some cheap-but-costly fake stuff, I'm not only NOT going to buy this, I'm NOT going to buy food items from Amazon.com.  Moving on in my search.  THANK YOU for taking the time to write and saving me from the same disappointment you must have felt."
I have recently noticed that the last few months of Trio snacks received are stale and more brittle than usual. I am told that this product is made in China which concerns me.<br /><br />I cannot find madatory expiration dates on the box which causes me even greater concern. I hope Amazon is reviewing their food products prior to shipping.
I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.
My kitten loves this food.  It was the food that she had when she was at the shelter and my vet carries the Hill Science Diet Line for both dogs and cats.  She rushes to her bowl when she hears the dry kitten food falling into her bowl.
"I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss."
"Without a list of ingredients, I can't buy this product.  There is no way to contact the buyer.  It's kind of scary."
"I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!"
We ordered these berries as accompaniment with Swedish pancakes for a school project World Cultures Fair.  They are similar to red currants with a stiffer skin.  We have never had them before so I cannot compare to other brands.  The delivery of the product was very quick; we thank you.
"These nuts are great and have the best price anywhere. I keep the used containers for storing all sorts of stuff. Laundry detergent, ice melt, coffee, cereal etc. The wide mouth jar lid is easy to spin on and off."
"After pricing out different places to purchase this coffee as a gift, we realized that Amazon was able to provide us with so many K-Cup options but we love Green Mountain it has great flavor for a morning or evening cup. Enjoy!! You will Not be disappointed in this purchase!!"
"I would actually rate this a 3 1/2.  Taste like Bit o' Honey or Mary Jane candy.  Stickier than peanut butter.  I use it on a toasted English muffin.  It is good for this purpose b/c the warmth of the toasted muffin makes this spreadable.  It is not really spreadable enough to use for sandwiches.  I will buy again, but wouldn't buy in bulk."
"I have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however, this is my favorite. Some I've tried are bitter; some are too light; some are too strong; but this one for me is just right! Some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured, the grounds filter out into the needle of the Keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which isn't difficult, just annoying. Never had a problem with these.  Breakfast in Bed k-cups are smooth, not too light and not too strong, right smack in the midddle. No bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day. Enjoy!"
"Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round."
"I like Stevita products and these are no exception. You don't have to worry about the ingredients, because everything is natural and there are no surprises here. The taste is good, albeit a little weak compared to similar ""Aspartame"" flavored products. However, when you do the math, you are paying approximately 70 cents per packet and this doesn't even include the price of the water. If you still want an all-natural drink mix that is less expensive, take a look at the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade. The product link is below.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XG2H94"">True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade Drink Mix, 10-count (Pack of 6)</a>"
"I have always loved these since my childhood. But until recently I have never been able to find them. Thank God for Amazon!Satellite Wafers are great conversation starters also.I just have 1 big problem with them, you can't eat just one!"
I stopped eating oreo cookies about twenty years ago or more. These are very good. All the organics and lack of assorted chemicals like High Fructose Corn Syrup and more make them safe to share with the children.
"These Chocoperfection bars taste so good, you'll never believe they are good for you!  I get these at my local Jimbo's for $3.85each but am hoping they will be available from Amazon soon!  What a delicious way to g35 14grams of fiber!<br /><br />Instead of sugar, Chocoperfection uses erythritol which has 95% fewer calories than sugar, 93% fewer than maltitol, and no effect on insulin levels, and oligofructose, a sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily from chicory (not the same as fructose).<br /><br />These silky-smooth, delicious chocolate bars actually help you lose weight because the high fiber content and the high fiber content also acts as an appetite suppressant.<br /><br />And unlike maltitol-sweetened chocolate, ChocoPerfection bars will never upset your stomach, give you gas, make you bloat, or stall your weight loss.  Chocolate Perfect!<br /><br />On top of all that, Chocoperfection is diabetic-safe and tooth-freindly, too.  What more could you ask of a chocolate bar?<br /><br />What is erythritol?<br /><br />Like xylitol, erythritol is a polyol or sometimes called a sugar-alcohol (although none of them contain sugar or alcohol,) and has some of the cavity-fighting similarities.<br /><br />Xylitol is as sweet as sugar and has about 2/3 the calories.<br /><br />Erythritol, on the other hand, is about 70% as sweet as sugar and and almost zero calories.  Plus it is better tolerated by most people<br /><br />with less gastronomical or laxative reactions.  By the way, XylitolNow sells erythritol in bulk on the main product page.<br /><br />Being only 70% as sweet as sugar, erythritol sometimes needs a little help in the sweetness department. In the case of these bars, that's where oligofrutose comes in.<br /><br />What is oligofructose?<br /><br />Oligofructose<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />Oligofructose, sometimes called Fructooligosaccharide or just  (FOS), is a subgroup of inulin, specifically those fructose polymers with a degree of polymerization (DP) &lt;= 10. Unlike most carbohydrates, it is not digested in the human small intestine and thus has a lower calorific value, whilst contributing to dietary fiber. Oligofructose is on the more soluble side, due to its lower chain length, than the general class of inulins and is therefore commonly used as an additive to yoghurt and other dairy products. It is used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves. Oligofructose is also a prebiotic stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in particular.<br /><br />Food Sources<br />FOS is extracted from fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, barley, wheat, and tomatoes. The Jerusalem Artichoke has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of FOS. (In the case of Chocoperfection, the oligofructose is extracted from chicory root.)<br /><br />Health Benefits<br />FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as ""fast food"" for the probiotic beneficial or ""friendly"" bacteria that naturally populate the gut, increasing their ability to benefit overall Gastrointestinal Tract (GI Tract) health, especially proper digestion. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections.<br /><br />And this from Steggall Nutrition:<br /><br />Oligofructose is a tremendous substrate for bifidus bacteria, stimulating its activity by several hundred percent. This is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract. Short chain fatty acids are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for the growth and maintenance of large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed.<br /><br />The ideal environment for healthy bacteria is quite different to the environment preferred by pathogens and gram negative putrefactive bacteria. Consequently the undesirable bacteria diminish in number as the healthy bacteria proliferate in the presence of oligofructose."
Paella and rissotto makers breath wasy. This product is grown in America and stands up very well against expensive imports. I love it and buy it in 50 lb bags and store excess in small freezer bags and freeze to protect from bugs.
This is a really great tasting cat food I presume because my two cats eat it all up. Great product at a great price. What more could you ask.
"I only bought this because the breeder where I bought my cat said she wouldn't eat anything else. I'm surprised my cat didn't starve to death, because she wouldn't touch this stuff, nor would my other cat. I donated it to the Humane Society."
"The first thing that I noticed is that the jar is LITTLE.  There are 13 servings per jar.  The fragrance is like a good old cherry kid's drink, and the flavor is pretty good.  All stevia products have some aftertaste (IMO), but this is pretty good- I drink it with a lot of ice, and that helps.  I'm not sure I'd drink it daily, but for a nice reprieve from plain water (I can't drink artificial sweeteners, so most sugar-free drinks are out), it's nice.  I like the TrueLemon products better, but for a plain cherry flavor, this is OK.<br /><br />EDIT- 7/22/2012<br /><br />The aftertaste is significant....probably will not reorder.  :("
"I have a four month old st Bernard puppy and have always fed him and my 6 year old German shep hill science.  I did some research and found out how awful that stuff is.  I always thought expensive meant good.  Even my picky gs eats this with no canned dog food or any other incentive.  Of course the puppy will eat anything, and everything, lol,but his coat is beautiful and I have not had any digestion problems.  I love that it is USDA grade meat and no corn.  Corn can kill st bernards.  All this for just a couple bucks more than hills science.  Love the fact that I can feed both dogs same food on the all stages kind."
"The cider is overly sweet and has a weird after taste, I'm guessing from the artificial sugar.  I couldn't really distinguish any apple taste.  A better alternative is Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider.  This was a waste of money for me"
"I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store."
"I served this Essentia water to my family at dinner tonight. My husband says it tastes like water. My son and I did a taste test between the filtered tap water from our fridge and Essentia. Neither of us could tell the difference. My daughter says Essentia has an aftertaste and refused to finish her cup. I'm not sure if she was imagining things or not.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think the flavor distinguishes Essentia from other bottled water. If you are looking for alkaline water that tastes like water, this will work just fine."
"None of that super-sugared [candied] dried fruit or flat tasting candy [e.g., chocolate] chips to mess up a yummy, but healthy snack. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate--the darker the better--but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing. If I want candy, I'll buy the good stuff.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon. My local market no longer carries it."
Excellent price for very good coffee. We enjoy it. It does leave a little fine grounds in the bottom of your though.
"These chips are more expensive in the store, when you can even find them.  I have ordered them from Amazon a few times and have received them in good condition every time.  Amazon has a great return policy if you ever have a problem with the contents on receipt."
"I bought these for my two small dogs. A day after they had them,both acted ""off"" ,they refused to eat their canned dog food(Wellness).The only thing different in their daily schedule was the Petrodex Dental Chews. I read the label,it states ""wash hands after handling"". If there is something so toxic in these chews that I must wash my hands after handling,I sure do not want my dogs chewing and eating them.They are in the garbage.If I could have awarded zero stars,I would have.I am going to stick to the Breath Brushers made by Zuke's. Pricier,but worth it to me."
"I bought this for the girl in my life.  She really enjoyed experimenting with it.  I also bought her an additional sushi book  a few months before that but it didnt cover the same things as the manual did., which elaborates on techniques more fully, and we're happily getting into making our own sushi. I'm sure this in no way prepares you to become a professional sushi chef, but there's definitely some satisfaction in preparing this type of cuisine if you've never made it before. Everything's in the box, including a brief sushi cookbook, the rolling mats, and many of the basic ingredients that are difficult to find in supermarkets. The book could definitely be better, but for a few bucks, it is still worth it."
These little crunches are so addictive! I bought them at Wholefood when they were on sale for $2.50 each at the store. Ever since I could not stop munching on these things. Who knew a little bit of seeds could go such a long way! Wow....
"The flavor is labeled as fruit punch, and it bears a resemblance to Hi-C Fruit Punch, but not as sugary. With the recommended mixture, it tastes like watered-down Hi-C. If you add more, it tastes fruitier without becoming overly sweet. However, it doesn't taste very natural, again like Hi-C. There are no discernible fruit flavors. It's a vague sort of fruitiness, like Vitamin Water Zero.<br /><br />I also tried it with my SodaStream. The carbonation dulls taste buds, so the soda water needs a lot of syrup for full flavor.<br /><br />It claims to be an energy drink, but I didn't notice any boost in my energy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great. For people who dislike plain water, this makes it less boring without overwhelming you with fruit flavors or sugary sweetness. But if you need energy or something sweet, you should buy a can of soda-pop.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: It was suggested to me that it might be okay for masking the off-flavors of cheap vodka. Not really my thing, but feel free to try."
Good product for our pets. These are great for older dogs because they are low in fat & soft to chew. Price is also good
"My son loves these.  Easy, gluten free item to put in his lunch bag"
"This is a great substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome. Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. I like mild best, and teriyaki is my second favorite. Both of these flavors are safe if you avoid spicy stuff like I do. If you like things hot, try some of the other flavors!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!"
"This is my favorite of all of the coffee and chicory products. It is strong, smooth tasting and not bitter. My friends, who are natives of New Orleans, introduced me to CDM coffee 20 years ago. It is difficult to find outside of Louisiana so I am thrilled to be able to purchase it through Amazon. For a real taste of New Orleans, you should try CDM coffee."
This is by far the best chocolate milk i have ever had. Its so freaking GOOD.
"This coffee had all the rich flavor that I expect from a dark roast and minimal bitterness.  I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price."
We adopted an adult mix last year who was in need of love and care.  His coat is now soft and shiny and the amount of waste he produces is significantly down from when he ate other food.  Well worth it to me.
"I like this so much, I signed up for autoshipping every three months.  The 3-bag bulk package is much cheaper than buying the 7-oz. cups.  As a diabetic, I really enjoy having something sweet that does not spike my blood sugar.  I grew up loving black licorice.  (If it is not black, it is not licorice.)  Of course, like everything else sweetened with maltitol, it must be taken in moderation to avoid uncomfortable gas or a laxative effect.  Never eat it on an empty stomach, and be prepared to get this chewy candy stuck in your teeth."
"Okay, General Tso's isnt exactly gourmet, and I know that its probably the #1 dish ordered at chinese take out places by americans who think its the epitomy of chinese cuisine. I will only eat it if its on some buffet and it looks fresh, a coworker of mine that will remain nameless always calls it ""Admiral Chos"" and we laugh at her everytime. ANYWAY, I was making stir fry over rice and needed a new taste and decided to try this bottle of Iron Chef, I mean how could Morimoto steer me wrong? It was actually a good blend of spicy and sweet, it blended well with the chicken and cabbage and onions. I did not make the traditional fried Tso's because lets face it, fried things are bad for you. I cant wait to try the other ""flavors"" of Iron Chef sauces!!"
"I love this oatmeal.  My complaint over the years was the time it took to cook.<br /><br />I solved this with a fancy rice cooker, which actually has a setting for oatmeal.  El perfecto!<br /><br />Ben"
"I admit it.  I just love snack foods.  And amongst my favorite snacks to eat are cookies.  I can't think of a year that I haven't ordered Girl Scout cookies and Oreos are amongst my favorite cookies (especially double stuff Oreos).<br /><br />So I was excited to have the opportunity to try the new ""Peanut Butter Creme Oreo Fudge Cremes"".  While I think that they could shorten the name of these cookies a bit, the bottom line is that they are yummy.<br /><br />The only description on the bag is ""fudge covered chocolate cookies"" so they could probably expand on that a bit.  But basically, it tastes like a single cookie wafer with peanut butter creme stuck to the side and then the whole thing covered in a soft fudge.<br /><br />The bag I received was 11.3 ounces, which is a generous size.  It is also resealable, so not only is it very easy to get at the cookies without a knife, scissors or your teeth, but it's also easy to reseal the bag and keep the cookies fresh.  Of course they probably won't be around long anyway, because you're going to gobble them up.  At least, that's what I expect to do.<br /><br />I really like these cookies.  If this was a Girl Scout cookie, I'm sure they'd sell very well.  I definitely do recommend them.  Just try not to eat the whole bag at once!"
"I'm not opposed to change,but I do oppose change when change wasn't needed in the first place. I am so disappointed in Necco's misguided decision to change their classic Sweethearts conversation hearts. Once a great traditional candy they're now just gross. They changed all the flavors, eliminated the white ones all together (which as luck would have it, were my favorites) and changed the nice crunchy texture to a soft disintegrating mess. Bleck. What a huge mistake. Why change a trusty classic? Why not just make a new candy?"
I had been well experienced with different Brand Names to produce Mangosteen Juice. I do not believe this Dynamic Health Mangosteen Gold is made 100% Pure Organic Mangosteen Juice. I am trying to cancel my order (every other month order).<br />I hope the Company who produce this Juice may double check to ensure this kind of Juice contains almost 100% Mangosteen Juice. Thanks. Shawn.
"Westsoy brand soy milk(in choices of Plain and Vanilla) is one of the only brands so far,that I have found that has an unsweetened choice in other flavors than plain - they even have a chocolate unsweetened but it's hard to find.If you have a Trader Joe's market near you, you may also find their own brand in the unsweetened variety.I try to stay away from sugar and dairy products is a thing of the past for me.I started using this several years ago. I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use ""Lactaid"", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Ingredients are Organic Soymilk(filtered water, whole Organic Soybeans),Natural Vanilla Flavor With Other Natural Flavors. Per serving it supplies 100 calories, 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a slim 32 0z. box, with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a long shelf life, and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. The price is about the same, give a take a few cents, as it is at my neighborhood grocery store...BUT-The shipping is so high, this is one product I would not recommend to buy on line. Maybe Amazon will eventually have a multi-pack site with the free shipping option. If anyone has come across such a site please leave a comment on my review - or if I come across one I will edit with the info-thanks!<br /><br />For dairy free diets, Westsoy is a good, healthy choice.<br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie"
"I bought the large bottle of liquid vanilla bean extract.  It works well, but about the same as other pure vanilla extracts.  The bottle is really generously large.  Next time I will<br />try the paste everyone is so happy with."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>Delicous Fruity Drink. This drink has the carbonated beverage fizz with out all the bad side effects.  My 7 year old daughter loved this drink.  Switch has fruity flavor, but not to sweet or overpowering.  No sugar or preservatives are added to this drink."
This is an excellent and bold decaf.  The flavor really reminds me of Cafe du Monde's coffee in New Orleans' French Marketplace!  It also tastes very nice and bold on the 12 oz. cup Keurig setting!
"Oatmeal is good for you, but I have always hated the taste.  The Maple & Brown Sugar flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal has always been my favorite way to eat it.  I started with the regular version, then moved to the Lower Sugar option, and have finally settled on the Weight Control variety.  The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.  Quaker Instant Oatmeal Weight Control fit my family's needs, but you should make sure you really look at the different products' nutritional information.  You can compare Quaker's products on their website: [...]."
Nice whole grain cereal and my 3 year old son already knows hearts and can say I love you this is his favorite.<br /><br />Would be nice to have this with Subsribe and Save. Maybe not at this time - later at some point would be great.
I will only buy these type of gummi bears.  The Haribo brand has an awesome quality and flavor to them that is uncomparable to all the other gummi bear brands I have had....I love that I can order a 5lb bag and have it delivered to my door!  It is a better deal than buying them at the store.  When certain stores have them on sale for 99 cents I usually stock up but now I don't have to!
"Back when I was a destitute college student, I and a fellow student worked together would share canned soup and rice meals to save money. He was from India, and he had these fantastic spicy pickles that would jazz up our otherwise bland meals.<br /><br />I've searched for those pickles for 20 years and I think I've finally found them--hot mango relish!<br /><br />If you like a little spice, then you will love this relish for making your meals have more kick. It has a lot of chile powder, so it is very similar to a Chinese chile sauce, except that it has chunks of mango fruit as well. Yow! My mouth is still burning! I love it!"
"excellent product. this is the second one i bought in the past 6 years. we use it almost every night. it is very quite,  the auto humidity setting are very basic but works well. we have not found that we need the antibacterial accessory and it holds up to the occasional dishwasher cleaning. i would recommend this product"
"Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue."
"My husband is Kenyan. This is the tea we drank everyday while we lived in Kenya! We have searched and searched for it here. We ended up giving up the search after a year of searching. I came onto Amazon and on a whim just to see if I could something at least close  to this tea. It was such a surprize when I saw this tea at the top of the search results list. I bought this tea as part of a Christmas gift for my husband, he is missing Kenya and his family there very much. I hope this will bring Kenya to him in small way. I really can't wait to see his face when he unwraps it on Christmas! It only took a few days to receive the tea. The package was well packed so there are no dents or breaks in the box. I am very happy with this purchase, and I can't wait to sit and have a cup with my husband like we did every morning in Kenya! :) I very much recommend this tea to any tea drinker. The shping and handling was almost as much as it costs for the tea, but well worth it!!"
"I don't know the deal is here but they are terrible.  I love Cracker Jacks and not just cause there is a prize, especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get.<br /><br />These arrived and the first box I ate seemed very stale, checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so I figured maybe it was that box.  But I'm a few boxes in now and they are all the same it's like chewing on cardboard.  I event went to the local 7-11 to get some to compare and those at 7-11 were 1000 timex better.<br /><br />Since it was so cheap to get them it's not worth the hassle to send them back so I think I'll just give them out for halloween."
"This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot.<br /><br />I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.  I average a couple of lattes a day, and a single bag lasts about 3 months."
"Let's be honest. Nothing will compare to real peanut butter - more specifically, Smuckers All Natural (creamy or crunchy, they both go down smooth). I'll crush a 26oz jar in a week, so obviously I needed a better alternative. Definitely still has a peanuty taste, but... something is missing. I'd still recommend this to anyone who is curious about it. I need to try some of the recipes they have on their website."
I have a mini-schnauzer that cannot have over 10% fat or it will make him very sick. These treats show the maximum fat content to be under that range and he loves them.
"My wife is obsessed with these things so I was willing to pay any price to get them but wow! Price plus shipping is outrageous! These bags are not even a pound (.8 lbs) and each bags comes out to a whopping $10 apiece...that's crazy! A friend of hers was going to surprise her with some of these but when she saw how much they were she couldn't bring her self to pull the trigger.<br /><br />To give Toyhousedeals the benefit of the doubt, these are hard to find on the web and are very expensive if you do find them so that's my reason for giving them 4 stars instead of even lower - although they are still responsible for their high shipping chargers. Bottom line is the product is great and Toyhousedeals performed excellently, it's just about the price.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I have found a solution: Just google ""black outback beans amish"" and you will find the exact some product in a no-name version for less than half the price - even with shipping. You'll find these people great to work with too. Enjoy!"
"God I love Flakes!  One of the best smooth milky melt in your mouth chocolate bars out there!  Gotta have em!  If you've never tried them, trust me on this, you will not be sorry ordering these."
"Great taste. Good crema. Wonderful in iced lattes.  I have been trying many different beans from various roasters, stores etc.  My husband & I both say these are the best of all that we have tried.  Affordable pricing makes them even better."
"I tried the Fog Chaser. It was rich and satisfying. I stored the yet-to-be-used pods in a ziplock bag, and they kept just fine. Used the last one after about 10-12 days - no difference in taste since the first pod from the pack of 12. A great buy, and very competitive with the dark roast K-cups in flavor and depth."
"We like this coffee the best of the many we have tried on Amazon. Normally we buy it at Costco but found it here for about the same price, so ordered it and had it delivered to our door by Amazon! Nice full bodied flavor."
"This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old ""My K-cup"" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says ""some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this ""work around"" for the time being.""  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more ""hole down the middle"" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!"
These are the best gluten and dairy free cookies out there. They are better then many cookies with gluten and dairy. I highly recommend them. My whole family loves them! They are very sweet and chocolaty.
"I've been making and eating rice throughout my entire life of 43 years now.  I've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything I like in my Zojirushi and Cuckoo rice makers.  Recently, I got interested in making authentic Spanish Paellas.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  Real Spanish saffron, Spanish Chorizo, and Spanish Paprika are rare and expensive items even in Los Angeles California.  Rabbit isn't easy to find either.  Nevertheless, I went through with the program and decided to build and authentic Paella.  After watching a plethora of YouTube videos, Pau Gasol on local TV, two episodes of Tyler's Ultimate, and one episode of Good Eats, I felt I had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />One thing the Spaniards stress: You can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure Saffron, (2) Calisparra Bomba from Valencia, (3) real smoky-hot Paprika from Spain, (4) Good extra-virgin olive oil.  You also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel Paella.  These are quite inexpensive.  I got a fully legit one from Valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  I also gathered that I should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />To make a long story short I purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  Chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  They called it the Rolls Royce of Rice.  They said it was unbeatable.  I was more than skeptical.  I have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and I've tried a lot of different types.  They're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />According to the poop-sheets, Bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. It's hard to overcook.  I've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  All of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  All sources said 3:1 when you use Bomba.  Bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />To make a long story short, I made my first authentic Spanish Paella 2 days ago.  It blew my brains out, and I don't say that lightly.  I've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  This was like a revelation from God.  I can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like Alton Brown, Tyler Florence, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  It's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />Bomba is delicious rice.  I've eaten a lot of rice, but this one is making me forget about the rest."
"I really do love Splenda.  With the additional additive of fiber, it can only be better, right?  Well, I tried it, and there is no taste difference.  I wasn't sent running to the bathroom.  Why should I, when there is only one gram?  Many of us have difficulty getting in the fiber that our body needs.  I will choose to purchase Splenda with fiber from now on... Another super product from Splenda."
It's been almost two years since I made the switch from USA teas to this Brit top seller. Wow great strong tea with no bitterness.  No string but I drink British style with milk & sweetner I use a spoon anyway.  I'd even buy it loose if it came that way.  I try to buy this through Amazon in the three pack with free Prime shipping since it appears to be the best price in USA and always fresh.  However it's not always available so when it is buy it.
This is pretty good soy sauce. Our Meijers recently started carrying this. So I wanted to try it. It is much better than kikkoman soy sauce. I have several recipes that give soy sauce as an alternative ingredient. I must say using this in those recipes made it so much better! I also put a squirt in my ramen or udon noodles. YUM!!!! Sooooo gooood.
"Like Lawyer Reader said in an earlier review, these things arrived at room temperature.  Shipping essentially doubles the price of these little fish, so you might assume that they get shipped in a reliable and safe way.  Not so.  It comes in a small box with little insulation and a couple of (melted) ice packs.  I'm going to eat them anyway.  I'll update this review when (if) I survive, but when one orders high-end food products, one expects first-rate handling of the product by the shipper. I'll be looking somewhere else for my next anchovy fix.<br /><br />Update.....<br />Well, I had four of these little things a couple of hours ago.  They are very good, and I'm still alive.  I've had better in restaurants, but these are better than any I've bought in a store or ordered online.  Still, I won't order them again because of the poor shipping practices."
"I bought these in NYC during the great blizzard of 12/26/10, to take with me on Amtrak, as my flight home was canceled.  I shared them with my seat mates, and we all thought they were delicious.  Different from regular Nature Valley granola bars, sort of a cross between a granola bar and a candy bar.  As I was packing up to get off the train (after a 9 hour trip!) I still had one pack of 2 bars left, and heard a woman with a french accent ask the snack bar operator if he had any chocolate left.  He said ""no"", and I handed her my last pack, told her it was as good as a chocolate bar, and left feeling good about sharing something so delicious."
"A very acidic orange juice, 4oz in the morning is all you need. The taste is excellent. I used some in a marinate for catfish fillets, replacing the lemon juice, it was most excellent!"
"I typically only like to drink Timothy's and Emeril's coffees.  I like coffee strong, without bitter aftertaste.  For a decaf, this is great coffee.  It's not as bold as Timothy's Midnight Magic or Rainforest Espresso (my 2 favorite caffeinated coffees), but for an afternoon or evening coffee that won't keep you up all night, its great.  Only downside is that I think it has more caffeine than other weak decaf coffees.  I like it, but it does affect sleep.  On a positive, if you have it in the afternoon/evening, it might give a LITTLE bit of a much needed pick-up, without getting you overcaffienated as can happen if you have too much regular coffee!"
"I was searching for healthy, no-mess snacks for my on-the-go lifestyle. I LOVE the new packaging for so many of the fruits/veggies! No spoon, no spill or drip... and very, very convenient!<br /><br />These taste like flavored applesauce - they have the applesauce texture, but also include veggie puree. Yum!"
I never tasted Zotz before.  I was just looking for some kind of grape candy with a little fizz and ordered these.  They are yummy!!  I keep wishing that Fizzies would produce the grape flavored fizzies again someday but these Grape Zotz will do for now.
"I love espresso in the evening, and good dark American coffee in a french press in the morning. I thought Starbucks was good until I tried Alterra, which is the best for whole beans. I tried about 30 kinds of K cups after buying the machine for something faster.  I learned that the extra bolds are the only ones with much flavor, that the ""espressos' are certainly not espresso, that some are too bitter and almost muddy, and I settled on the Green mountain Sumatran. It was not nearly as full flavored or as good as my french press using Alterra Brazilian bourbon coffee, but in a hurry it was much faster than grinding beans, boiling water, mixing it in the french press, and waiting 5 minutes to push down the plunger and drink the coffee. But recently when I tried to reorder, Amazon was out and I searched for a new K cup coffee. I was scientific, as I read all Amazon reviews on extra bold coffees that received almost unanimous 5 star ratings, ordering 4 of them to try: Tully's Sumatra, Van Houtte Taste of Europe 100% Colombian (I never knew Colombia was in Europe?), Caribou Mahogany, and Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights coffee. I have rated and tried them over and over and they always rank Parisian #1, Mahogany a not too distant #2, Sumatran #3, and Colombian (the lightest one) a distant #4. I then later tried Parisian against my old favorite Green mountain Sumatran, and clearly Parisian is the absoute best. It is still not as good as my french press coffee, but it has good deep flavor without bitterness and I do not feel deprived when I drink it in the morning."
"Awesome, great product. They cost $1.15 each which is about a third what an iced coffee costs at Starbucks. I will always have these on hand."
"The price was great (>$5/lb)...but, next time, I'll prefer to pay more to avoid this coffee (to my takste=, this is more along the lines of dishwater).<br /><br />Given a choice, I'd take Pete's Major Dickinson's very dark, delicious blend.,  Unfortunatelym it's almost 3X the price of this coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll find something in between the two. ...I'll report back when I find it!"
"This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds"
I recommend these !!! Just the right size!! My favorite! Great stocking stuffers! Wonderful for a snack and the size keeps you from eating to many!
These are delicious--crunchy and full of flavor. I wouldn't even try the flavored ones--but that's me. Eat them alone or dip them.
"These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless ""potato sticks"" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the ""sea salt"" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual ""fry""<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally. But there are many other healthy alternatives that taste SO much better."
"We have been geting Pemmican Beef Jerky for years and now they have changed it enough that the texture is off and has an off taste. My husband opened the first bag and threw it out because he thought that it had gone bad. The bad news was that they were all like that. I think the ""New"" was defenitly not for the better. We will not be buying any more of this product."
I love these chips; they are my favorite to dip in French onion dip. They are the best!! They are so much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than at my local grocery store. I highly recommend ordering these chips!!
"These 1.5"" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale."
Received package in a timely manner and in acceptable condition. The rice is excellent and offers a wonderful alternative to white rice.
"I don't know what we did wrong here in NY that we got Starbucks, and Seattle kept Tully's.  This is the best coffee I have ever had!  It doesn't matter which type of coffee you choose (although I am partial to both the Kona and the House Blend), they are all great."
"I can't rave more about this Coconut Oil. I have been using it for years and truly love it. I have searched for other deals as good as this, but have found nothing quite like it for the quality and price. Coconut oil is an amazing addition to your health and wellness regime; I highly recommend it for ALL of it's incredible healing and medicinal properties, besides the fact that it just tastes great! I use it everyday for body oil, cooking, baking, on salads, raw as a supplement, in my hair, as a make-up remover, wound healer, and sooooo much more. There are so many websites that explain the health benefits of this exceptional food source; check it out. This product is the best and I will continue to buy from this brand for years to come...best of all, it delivers within days of ordering with Free shipping right to my door...in Hawaii! Can't beat that. :)"
"The flowers were delivered on-time and my (""sender"") name and other details were not shared to person whom I sent the flowers was ensured ,which is appreciated. Very pleased with the effeciency demonstrated by the vendors promoted through Amazan. Their rating also helps in selecting the vendor. Thanks very much. If possible, enable us to make payment in our countries' currency rather than in dollars. It make the entire puchasing even more hassle free."
"This is the best stevia brand on the market. It's not bitter at all, and will really satisfy those lingering sugar cravings. It dissolves well in beverages, too. A little goes a very long way, so this little bottle will last a long time. Don't suffer through the bitterness of other brands. This is the only stevia I'll buy."
"I've only used this a few of times and it seems to have had an effect.<br /><br />I never had dandruff falling on my clothes but (don't be grossed out here) when I'd scratch my head, I'd have debris under my fingernails.  Since I've been using this, my scalp doesn't itch as much and when I do scratch, there's less dry skin debris.<br />Wow, I sound like Big Foot's sister - HA!!  But that's life.<br /><br />My hair is also soft and not as dry.  SO - less scalp itching because my scalp is cleaner and nicer hair - it WORKS  : - }"
I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again.
"Im not sure.. but think I got some kind of mouth irritation from these candies.. they are superb tasting and seem to be ok..but they have a funny smell and my mouth ,gums, throat and tongue were irritated really bad after a few days of munching on say .. maybe 7 to 10 of these a day.. it could just be a coincidence but Its gone away since I stopped eating them.. Otherwise.. large amount but order more than one so you get your money's worth in shipping.."
"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning."
Love this coffee!  Makes the best 'Latte's'!.<br />I have one (or two) every morning!<br />Does not have that 'flavored' synthetic taste...........<br />Hazelnut is my very favorite and this coffee does it justice.
"I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links."
"I am not a coffee snob, and not very up on the various types of coffee's out there, but I certainly know when something tastes like burnt crap! I recently got a breville coffee maker that came with an assortment of cups. Most of the coffee that came with it were OK, but this Italian Roast stuff was horrible! I took one sip and dumped it. I'm sure there are people who like this taste, but not me. personal preference I guess. If I could give a 0 I would."
"As the title states, I love Steaz green tea (esp. the Peach flavor), however, the last time Amazon sent me my order (from their Subscribe & Save program), the tea had a very bad aftertaste to it. It was metallic tasting and very bitter. It wasn't expired, so I'm not sure what was the problem. I couldn't return the item (since I guess you can't return food and beverages, even if it's defective), so I ended up throwing it all away. It made me mad because I wasted money. Just an FYI - I have had several similar issues with other food items from Amazon, so I'd be careful to order food and beverages from Amazon. I guess the items stay in their warehouses for long periods or something because I've gotten melted gummy bears, stale crackers, and more bad tasting tea (Celestial Seasonings). I am now very cautious and hesitant to order food and beverages from Amazon."
"Searched around for the best price, and because I'm a prime member w/ free shipping, the best total price was here at amazon.  I've used this for several years to coat steaks before grilling (adding blue cheese and grilled Portabella mushrooms on the top), and I can say, a better steak can't be found for me.  With two large containers, though, I've gotta find some more uses for this delicious seasoning...."
"I was so sad when I opened the first can.  It did not taste well to me or my friends.  We are thinking either the garlic is too much or it is the fire roasted taste.  My friends advised me to send my cans back, I decided to donate them to a food pantry.  Hopefully someone else will like them more than me."
No need to make brownies from scratch anymore.  Deep chocolate flavor without being over powering and chewy crusts.<br />Will keep a box on hand.<br /><br />Yummy.
"Actually, if your cats are like mine, they will crave this treat every 10 minutes. I don't know what the secret ingredient is--and I can't vouch for the naturalness of all the ingredients--but these sure seem to enjoy them."
"I come from the land of good tea and coffee and I buy my tea from the States, I think that says enough.<br />Highly recommended tea. Very good taste!"
Now THIS is coffee!! Strong bold flavor with no bitterness. Thank you thank you thank you!
"I had been told that finally the day would come when my own package from amazon would come and today it finally came. What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, & Tuna & Shrimp.  I was sleeping when my person stood with my treat dish poised above my nose.  ""Don't bug me"" I thought as I sleepily eyed what she had in hand....A TREAT!<br /><br />I quickly followed into the kitchen to partake of a delicious entree of Red Snapper.  This totally looks like peoplefood!  I scarfed down a half a can immediately and if there was a pattern at the bottom of my bowl I would have licked that off as well.  That was one clean dish.  I've been told that tomorrow we'll try maybe Yellowfin, which sounds equally good.<br /><br />Likes:  looks like peoplefood, smells good, not overly fishy, and they add vitamins and no wheat gluten....hm, not sure about that one, but apparently wheat gluten isn't good.  Anyway....it is delicious and it is much like my other favorite, ""Sheba"".<br />Dislikes: My people wouldn't just leave me the whole can because they don't think I'll stop eating, but that's really more of a personal issue.<br /><br />Four paws up on this one!"
Not as messy as fresh berries but just as good especially here in the South where they're hard to grow!!!
"These are delicious. I cannot buy them. Because I will eat them. Voraciously.<br /><br />But if you have more self-control than I do, buy and enjoy!"
"There doesn't seem to be a lot of actual chocolate in this product. I would have thought it'd have a dark chocolate taste, but instead it was only vaguely chocolate. Checking the ingredient list it appeared to have a soy based filling with artificial flavors. It reminded me of cheap chocolate candies around the holidays. You might find a milk chocolate easter bunny, but you'll also find a ""chocolate flavored"" easter bunny. These will look the same, but not taste the same. This cereal is like the ""chocolate flavored"" easter bunny.<br /><br />My kids liked it, but for something called ""krave"" that pushes the chocolate angle on the marketing, I was left wanting."
"This extract doesn't smell like roses at all.  It has a very herbal smell, something like lavender but not as pleasant.  I'm very disappointed.  Small bottles of rose essence I bought at an Indian grocery smell much more like roses than this product does.  I don't know if there's a chance that the bottle was mislabeled and really is some other extract, but I won't be able to use this product to flavor things with a rose flavor.  I'll have to stick with rose water and the rose essence I bought at the Indian market."
"Hi,<br />You can hardly find just the double chocolate treats by itself locally and once I found this place, I've ordered several times. Good service and great pricing each time!"
The breakfast cookie is excellent. My grandson came back from a scouting trip and said it was better than the energy bars they were given to eat. Nice blend for any time of day. I pop mine from the freezer into the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. Taste  best warm.
This is a great bargain - a much better deal than I can get at my local pet store. I use these as special treats for my dogs - not an everyday thing but for especially good behavior or when I'm compelled to pamper them.
"But the idea of expecting valid testimony to claims of a ""healthy"" product when all that is offered is an exceedingly small quantity is not reasonable. So, yes...it is a palatable confection. More than that? I've no clue."
"Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :("
"I had my first experience with Big Train Chai, 8 years ago, it was in a christmas basket from an employer. It was so friggin good, that, ever since, I always treat myself to a box of 25 every year. Yup it is that good.. Think I will go make a cup right now !"
"This is such a tasty tea blend!  The flavors combine so nicely; black is actually a very nice complement for the strong mate, as it enhances, but doesn't overpower the flavor.  Very tasty!"
"these are pretty good, there is still the after taste but they will do just fine.. they do handle the pizza craving. Expensive!"
"I love this quinoa. It is delicious and a great source of protein and fiber. I mostly eat it in the morning for a substitute to oatmeal. However, you should definitely watch the price of this item. I received an email from Amazon asking me to come review it, and when I logged on I saw the price was actually double what I paid less than two months ago. I paid $20 total for two of these (8 x 16oz pouches) using the Subscribe and Save option. At this new price, it is more expensive than my local build foods store."
I don't know if it is healthy - but it makes a great Ma Po (or Ma Bo) Tofu.  We use fresh green scallions and cubed firm tofu.  Serve over a bed of rice.  Nothing more needed.
This makes a great cup of coffee and is not too strong. It's the perfect morning brew to get the day started.
"In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of ""good"" where you grimace and rasp ""H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!"", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such! [...]"
My husband wont put ANYTHING else in his coffee- we've loved this stuff since childhood.  The price here is the best I've seen anywhere.
"My local store stopped carrying this item. I tried to use clam juice, and other brand broth and stocks but they didn't compare and were more expensive per oz. I was THRILLED to find this on Amazon and with FREE Super Saver shipping, very easy to add another item. The companies website has outrageous shipping."
"This was a good buy and cheaper than I could get in the store.  It arrived when I expected it to and I didn't have to drive to the store, fight the traffic getting across town, try to find a parking space in front of the pet store, wait in line at the register and lug a big heavy bag home.  How great is that??  My lab loves this food...I've been feeding it to her for about 6 months but she hasn't lost any weight yet...Guess I need to give her more exercise for that to happen...where's that leash......."
This is one of my wife's favorite. Grove Square has another great product to share with Kcup users.  Now we need some specials  to bring the price per unit down.
"Hi-Chew is a favorite in our family.  You can buy directly from Japan if you have to have the wrapper in Japanese; otherwise this is the same great, chewy candy."
These cookies taste great.  I couldn't find any GF sugar cookies at home so I ordered these.  My kids loved them and couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as Keurig coffee goes, you have like, a hundred choices.  If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word ""strong"" or ""dark"" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.  I brew it in the afternoon, and it gives me that last-half-of-the-day pickup.  Give it a try!  At least buy the smallest option available and see what you think.  If you like strong coffee, you won't be disappointed!"
"I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper."
"THIS IS A BOLD DECAF THAT I JUST LOVE , I FORGET THAT THIS  IS DECAF THATS HOW GOOD IT TASTE"
My honey arrived yesterday with no leakage. The honey tastes great! It doesn't have that acidic aftertaste that the honey at my local supermarket does. The price is very competative as well.
"It's the best food my cat has loved for a long time, there's nothing left after I put it down and she craves it, I've a very happy cat!"
"Mine did not work well at all. As another person said, the gopher can push a set trap out of tunnel and not spring the trap because the trigger is not sensative enough. I recommend Maccabee traps. They cost a little more, but I have had a lot better luck. I don't even waste my time setting the easy set traps. Avoid!"
"I use this food for my aging cat who gets a quarter teaspoon of Miralax twice a day.  I mix each dose in half a can of this food and she laps up the gravy.  She rarely eats any of the meat, but this is the only food she'll take the Miralax in.  I can get this cheaper at my local grocery, but they're often out of it.  Sometimes she'll eat prime filet turkey or the chicken and tuna.  But the chicken is her favorite."
Arrived in a timely manner.  Cooks up with very few kernels left over.  A great price and very easy to make.  Cut off the top and squeeze everything in the cooker.  Enjoy.  Not quite theatre style but close.
"The best I can say is that the taste is quite origonal and unique.If you want the best and dont mind paying fot it then this is for you.<br /><br />The bad part is the large cost of the product.But, it is not disappointing in taste."
"The product arrived on time and was well packaged. It's a durable construction, there is enough space for the 54 cups it says it can hold and the product looks great next to my Keurig coffee maker.<br /><br />I ended up buying this design drawer as I think the carousels use up too much space for the number of pods they can hold, and after reading reviews for drawers to put underneath coffee makers I figured that with a drawer underneath my coffee maker there wouldn't be enough space left between the top of my coffee maker and the cupboard to be able to lift the top of the coffee maker open to put new cups in. If I would have had enough space, I would have probably bought the Nifty storage drawer to put underneath my coffee maker. Nevertheless I would recommend this product."
This coconut oil has great taste eaten alone or when cooking. My girls love it when I cook their eggs.
"I purchased this organic yogurt snack for my daughter.she said the snack melt in her mouth quickly ,the different flavor tastes different, she likes the mixed berry most.<br />The only concern is the sugar content is still a bit high ,so I try to limit the amount I give her when  on the go ,at the playground ,recommend other moms  to try."
"The taste is bold, but smooth, good flavor.  Even when used on the large cup brew (10oz), it still has a great taste, not watered down.  I plan on purchasing this again."
"I first sampled this tea at a Japanese Garden in Del Ray Beach Florida...I fell in love with it. I drink at least one pot (18 oz) every afternoon. It is delicious, nourishing, envigorating...I can't give it enough superlatives! If you like Gen Mai Cha, this is the one, bar none."
"This is an o.k. product for wet food for my Chihuahuas & I love the size & price.  The subscription process gives me a lower price & I don't worry about running out.  My dogs are now on a really good dry food for small dogs but the almost 2 years I used this wet one, I was happy."
I can tell a significant difference in the acid level of the coffee. Wonderful flavor and my husband has really noticed a difference in the affect it has on his acid reflux.
"I like this coffee a lot.  Also the Gloria Jean variety pack of five different flavors.  If you like flavored coffee, even occasionally these are very nice; a medium blend."
"I don't like flavored coffee, so when I saw a review that the cinnamon flavor was weak I decided that's worth a try. It is exactly right.... a very subtle cinnamon that is incorporated into the grounds and activates when the coffee is brewed. It is not overpowering and adds just a little extra spice to an all ready good cup of coffee."
"I grew up drinking tea that my mom brought home from Ireland.  Having visited Ireland as a kid, I got addicted to tea, but American tea just isn't strong enough to match the Gold tea my mom liked best.  I think this Barry's tea is now my new favorite.  I've been to England to visit cousins, but they were drinking P.G. Tips.  P.G. Tips was okay until I found Barry's tea.  I like bold coffee and apparently bold tea."
"This brand of green tea no where in taste like the wonderful and refreshing flavor I've tasted in many Asian restaurants.  There is nothing fragrant or enjoyable about this tea...the strange, dull flavor is indescribable.  I'm going back to my Bigelow faves.  What a wasted purchase!"
My dog loves these but I only give her one or two a week because they can be fattening. I also always keep an eye on her when she is eating one. Great product.
"This salmon roe caviar is both affordable and delicious.  Each little pop of salty roe atop a blini or water cracker is devine.  Also good paired with raw quail egg, ponzu, sake, scallion, sea urchin roe and tobiko for an ""uni shooter""...Yummmmm..."
"On the strength of the reviews for this, I decided to give Ambrosia Honey a shot. It's a gamble buying honey, having never tasted it.<br /><br />Luckily, this honey exceeded my expectations. I normally buy locally-produced honey at twice the cost. The depth of flavor is much better with this honey. It's hard to describe, but the flavor is both complex and light. If you're used to cheap grocery store honey, Ambrosia Honey will be a real treat.<br /><br />The price for this 4-pack is what pushes this honey to five-stars. It's an incredible value, considering what good honey costs.<br /><br />The dispensers are well sealed, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, for these to leak in transit."
I bought the two pack with both flavors and I actually found that I like this one way more. It is almost like a peanut butter cup. The only downside is that it is pretty expensive. If there is ever a sale I would definitely stock up.
"I can't give these a 5 because the ingredients show they are very processed.  I'm not sure how healthy they are.<br /><br />But the taste is great - very hot  - like about a nuclear on the Zaxby's scale.  If you like hot wings, you'll like these.  Be prepared to not be able to leave them alone.  When my husband buys a bag, we sit there and eat them until they are gone.  Also, have something to drink handy!"
"The taste just isn't good enough to fit the price.  Overpriced, not healthy enough for that ""organic and good for you!"" price and the taste didn't impress anyone in my family including a slew of teenagers.  It will now sit in my closet. Sticky/chewy/tart/odd flavor is how I'd describe it.  I bought it after reading the good reviews but it's just too strange a taste for us to ever repurchase or to justify that high price."
"Gazebo Room Salad Dressing & Marinade works really well as a good dressing, but don't overlook the opportunity to use it as a marinade on salmon, chicken, or vegetables before putting them on the grill. One note. This item is better if you do not refrigerate it after opening, as it does require some solid shaking prior to use to suspend the flavor elements in the olive oil."
Reality strikes.  I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years !  It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow!
I can no longer buy this in my area so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It is one of my favorite breath mints which I keep in various places around my home as well as in both of my cars.
"i grew up in calif. where see's was born, and it has been a tradition in our family for generations. they are absolute quality! i ordered some last march and they were unusually damaged in shipment. i waited until now, 10 months later, to let them know. i did not expect a refund of course. i couldn't believe it when they offered to send me out new chocolates!! that is 1st class service for a 1st class product. i am in france now and i would rather eat see's than a french chocolate any day of the week."
"I read some other reviews and saw that Dove's Body Wash for men dried up skin, clogged up pores, etc...  But remember, everyone's body chemistry is different.<br /><br />For me, this is the best body wash ever as it fits my chemistry perfectly.  I've used so many different face washes in the past, from Jack's to, Niveas, to Adidas, Old Spice and all of them caused me to break out on my face.<br /><br />Only this product does not cause me to get more pimples.  Yes it does dry my face out a little (but every face wash does that).  To remedy that, I put lotion on my face after I shower.  HOwever, after about 2-3 weeks of putting lotion on, I started to break out again so I took a 1 week break from putting on lotion and my skin was clear again.<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />Basically, if your body chemistry is anything like mine, this will make your pimples disappear.<br /><br />It also smells really good - not too overpowering so that it'll mess with any cologne I put on.  As for how it works as a body wash, well I'm not too picky and I don't see any difference from this product than Old Spice or any other men's wash.  But for washing my face, this thing is absolute magic."
"I live out in the sticks so it's great that I could get sticky ric at all.  Excellent product, let it soak overnight for best results."
Bobbaaayyy!!! My cat loves this stuff and now ignores her regular kibble and wet food in lieu of her treats. She's over 16 years old and at that age it's good to see her get excited over something as simple as a handful of kitty snacks.
"If you are new to Thai tea, this is for you.. The flavor is light than expected.. For authentic strong taste you should get the Thai tea chai thai loose leaves it's way better than this.. I bought 2 boxes of it because the packaging looks nice but I had to use 3 pouches to make it strong and aromatic like the restaurants serve.."
"Been looking for a good tasting cocoa tea for over a year & finally this is it.  I am attempting to be 100% sugar & gluten free so this ""treat"" at night is perfect while I try to make this a life long habit."
"I read many reviews before buying both Jet Fuel and Black Tiger because I really wanted an extra strong k-cup brew. I hate to say this but neither of these brews are stronger than any other ""extra bold"" brews I have tried. If you get this just know that you still need to use a smaller amount of water to make a strong cup of bold tasting coffee. I think the new Starbucks bold brews actually make a stronger cup of coffee."
Such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks.  The arrived quickly.  So easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack.
"This gum has very good flavor, but it only lasts about a minute. However, I can chew this gum for hours without it dissolving like other gums. High quality ingredients, just wish the flavor lasted longer."
"I wanted to make sure my kittens had the best, healthiest food and read many reviews on Felidae and how good it was for kitties.  My cats won't even touch it, and unfortunately I bought two cases of it.  Oh well."
"Very happy with the purchase. This money tree is so cute.....I bought it as a gift for mom, but of course if you're buying as a gift you better have a bigger and better pot. And the shipping was very fast, I got it in only four days."
I highly recommend this! It is the best low carb jam I have tried. It is real fruit and tastes excellent!
"I can no longer purchase this tea in the stores, so this is the only place that I have found it.  Thanks, for carrying it."
"These tasted so good! I was surprised because I have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. I would eat these by choice, not because I have to."
"It was interesting that Eight O'Clock Coffee French Vanilla Whole Bean came came in the door about the same time my old favorite coffee, Folger's French Vanilla Whole Bean was going out (dicontinued). The flavor of this Eight O'Clock Coffee French Vanilla is identical to that of the old Folger's French Vanilla.<br /><br />I also think the Amazon's price is comparable to my nearest grocer which is about 30 miles away. I used to make a monthly trip specifically to pick up 15 to 20 bags of this Eight O'Clock Coffee French Vanilla. Now, with Amazon's free shipping, I save about 1.5 hr driving and the associated fuel costs every month."
"I love sunflower seeds and eat a lot. I try a lot of different brands and flavors. These are the best BBQ flavored seeds. Try them and you will see that I'm right. For other flavors, I recommend different brands so I'm not sold on any brand."
"i used these as a decor on ginger bread.my kids actually picked them off of the bread to eat! so being curious i tryed them,the taste is very good! they liven up ginger bread in decor and taste!"
"The so-called Angry Birds candies are tolerable, except for the black ones. What in the name of hellfire and brimstone was *that*? It was disgusting!!! Tasted like dried bird dropping. OK, let me guess, a New World ""Blackbird""? That would explain a thing or two... The others were, as I said, tolerable. However, I have other favourites in the candy department. Three stars is quite enough for this collection."
This product already contains chocolate and sugar so I just need to chuck it in the ice cream machine or in a gelatin slurry for an easy dessert.<br /><br />This is only a purchase because of the current promotion.
"I'm the first American born into my mother's UK family, so when I say that I was raised on tea, I am not exaggerating. The thing is, unlike coffee, I never have sugar with my tea - just a little bit of milk...drinking it this way makes me more aware of the subtle differences between tea brands and ""flavors.""<br /><br />Even with all the herbal teas available, Earl Grey will always be my favorite tea. The Higgins & Burke Earl Grey has just the right amount of bergamot. When I opened the individual foil-wrapped bag, the orange aroma hit me first...not overpowering, but rather inviting. This was a surprise because I've had some Earl Greys that had so much bergamot, I couldn't detect any other aromas.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth, and I've enjoyed every cup, but the real test was with my mother. She's always complained that many Earl Grey teas at our local store are so weak that she has to saok more than one bag per cup, but she loved Higgins & Burke!!"
"Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson.  After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called ""The Burger"" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam.  When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made.  This is from Skillet's website: ""... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam...""<br /><br />This stuff is great!  It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar.  It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on.  Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato.  This will be a regular item in my house.  I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread."
I must eat gluten & sugar cane & dairy free.  These bars allow me to avoid my allergies and they taste delicious.  I eat at least one every day.
This is one of my favorite k-cup coffees. Bold and assertive but smooth and without bitterness. Unfortunately it's out of stock at Keurig.com where a 24 count box sells for $13.90(for members)and includes free shipping. I considered ordering a box here until discovering the unreasonable price plus shipping of this item from this seller. Buyer beware!
"I am allergic to gluten and love tomato soup. I normally buy the Roasted Red Pepper but when I wnet to order it was out of stock so took a chance and tried this. I tipped the bowl to get the last drop it was that good,  You won't be dissappointed and if you crush fresh basil and top with sour cream and cheese it is a gormet meal."
"Not great tasting if you fix your lasagna using these noodles and plan to eat it within a 60 minute baking time.  However, if you fix your lasagna in the morning it is fabulous after baking that evening for dinner.  Or even better, refrigerate and bake it off the next day.  These noodles save tons of time and taste just as good as the ones you have to pre-boil.  But they only taste just as good if you do not eat them right away.  Then they taste a bit like cardboard.  They do need to absorb some of the sauce and cheese, etc.  You will not be sorry you bought these.  They sure save time.  And, I love being able to buy them at Amazon.com."
These are addictive although you can find a better price at Sam's Club if you don't use the 10 dollar off coupon
"The quality of the Twist was its usual good quality, but they would have survived the transport much better had they been in the plastic tubs, as advertised and as we have been used to getting them while they were still available locally.  The other plus for the plastic container is its value as a container after the Twists are gone."
"Great coffee, very bold and smooth.  It was excellent and the price was the best.  Try different brands all the time and this one will be a repeat..."
"There is one store in town that has honey stingers, and right before all the major bike rides, it sells out of the Honey Stinger Golds.  These boxes keep me from worrying about having enough when I need them.  And honey stingers are so much better than the other energy gels, whose taste & texture don't agree with me."
"I have known about being a celiac for about 5 years and have tried several products.  As we know, baking at home is the safest but, sometimes we want to be like other people and be able to 'grab a snack'.  These cookies are very tasty!  They are crisp, not chewy, which is how I like them!  I highly recomend them!!"
These k-cups are just what my son wanted!  The price was excellent and the flavor is rich.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa.
"I bought these treats because they looked liked they could break into suitable pieces for my pup.  And they did.  Just by hand you could break it down to each leaf of the flower that the treat is shaped to be.  A 7oz bag comes with about 90 treats at ~9 calories each.  I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.  On several occasions my pup's had to cough/clear her throat after feeding her one of these.  But it's not a big deal she loves these treats."
"The lemon flavored wafers ARE really good, but the STRAWBERRY are BEST!<br />I'm going to ask Amazon.com to get them on the subscribe & save program.<br />J."
"These things grow like crazy.  I planted my gardens (one gourmet herbs, one holiday herbs) three months ago and I have trouble keeping up with the amount of growth.  I use a lot of parsley and thyme so I'm delighted there is so much, but the excess of some of the others is going to the freezer. . . more chervil than I've ever seen.  The plants are healthy and clean with no bugs like outside gardens.  What a blessing.<br /><br />Yes, the lights are the very white daylight bulbs, but in my den, it adds nice lighting where I wouldn't otherwise have any and I rarely use the overhead light anymore so the electricity is a wash for me.  The pump in one garden made noise at first, but I read the FAQs on the website, which said it was likely that nutrients had gotten into the pump.  I jiggled the pump a bit and the problem went away.  Since then I put the nutrients at the front of the water well and have had no further problems.  Some people complain about the dripping sound but if you keep the water level up you don't hear it.<br /><br />I tried for years to grow fresh herbs indoors during the winter and was never really successful until now.  The units are very easy to care for and you can't beat the prolific harvest.  Now, if only they'd let me choose the individual herbs to grow instead of offering just the combination sets.  I may have to try planting my own seeds as they have kits that allow you to do that.  I'm looking forward to free salads all summer when it comes time to replant. Great product."
These are every bit as good as the other two reviewers stated. Awesome butter cookies!!! There's a lot of butter taste in these cookies and they're not overly sweet. Just right! I'll be buying again when the 12 pack runs out. Amazon please make sure you keep these in stock on a continuing basis!
Thank you for your excellent product. I hope to buy more in the near future. This product is very good for my mind and body. Thank you again.
"*****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****"
"I really like this soup although I have to lower my 5 star rating to 2 stars.  The last time I paid $15.63 and today I received an E-Mail advertisement for $20.74, a 33% price increase.  By the way, Bob's Red Mill Soup Bean Seasoning increased a whopping 48% up to $47.55.  When you get an E-Mail about one of your favorite products that Amazon tracks, don't just assume they're passing on a price bargain!<br />UPDATE:  Two days later after my original post the price has now decreased by $1.33 to $19.41.  I'm a seasoned Amazon customer who is generally very satisfied.  Although after following the price fluctuations I kind of feel like I'm involved in the stock market."
Use distilled water and boil water just to the point that it starts to boil.  Pour approximately 6 oz of water over teabag and let steep for 4 minutes.  One teaspoon sugar makes my perfect cup of tea.
"Keeps K cups neat and shows everyone the variety. No sifting through boxes to decide what you want. Definitely worth it, made well too."
The orange spice tea is fabulous.  It needs no sweetening and it is like having a treat!
"Read the label carefully, it's instant coffee, not the ground coffee as the other brands, no filter inside, and had partially hydrogenated oil in it, I returned it as hydrogenated oil is harmful and the coffee itself is kind of gas station quality."
"I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer."
The episodes after Michael Scott Paper Company forms.  I bought them as a joke gift for a huge fan and they were perfect and roughly as dangerously addictive as you might imagine. :)
"The taste is one of the better tasting Larabars I've had. It has a slight sour taste because of the dried fruit pieces, but it's less noticeable then some of the others. All and all it's pretty good. Definitely filling."
"You get a better deal for these if you order a subscription on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three seven month old kittens who devour Fancy Feast almost instantaneously, the moment I serve them a can."
"Easy to mix with water, tastes great. Unique in that you can make little PB truffles with it by reducing the water used! Cool!"
"I like strong coffee that doesn't taste like dishwater. This is the one for me. It actually rivals my home brew choices of Starbuck's Espresso and Gold Coast beans. I bought this one for me, because my coworkers like their coffee a bit on the lighter side. This is so good ... I need to get one of these brewers for my house so I can drink it on the weekends!"
"These are my favorite cookie.  Crunchy and then melt in your mouth, with little pieces of ginger.  I take a box to the office and it's gone by end of day.  Try 'em!"
"I have tried all the GF gravies and have found this to be the best.I use it a lot over rice with a tad of GF soy sauce, mushrooms, some veggies,ground meat, chicken etc. I've added sour cream for stroganoff  and swedish meatballs.Great for stir fry,meatloaf,in the crockpot for pot roast or stew. A big plus is that it is organic , not loaded with all the chemicals most package food contain."
"My cats seem to enjoy this food as much as their erstwhile favorite, Wellness wet food.  They are pretty fussy so I am pleased.  I also like the fact that the the ingredients seem to be nourishing (no by-products) although since some reviewers have mentioned a possibly dangerous ingredient, I think I will do a little more research before ordering this again."
"You might as well eat the box it came in.  If it weren't for the almonds, it would have no taste at all.<br />It's too fine to eat dry as a snack, and too solid to eat with cold milk as a cereal.<br />I imagine it would be a decent substitute for granola in a fruit and yogurt parfait, but I haven't tried it that way yet.<br />But remember, it's HEALTHY."
"Dynasty Wasabi Mayonnaise makes a boring sandwich exciting, It's like a church lady who turns into Lady GaGa. Very spicy, tasty, mysterious, and perfect.  I love it!"
"If you don't mind the inevitable increased cancer risk and/or poisoning from these Chinese-manufactured dog products, then these might work for you.  But if you care about your dog, you would do well to avoid ANY edible dog product made in China, period.  There should be a large warning label for Chinese pet products.  It's full of chemical additives that will slowly kill your pets.  Please google this and find out the facts."
"My shipment did not arrive on the date that I expected BUT these people sent me a very apologetic email and offered to make it right for me.  I was so impressed with their customer service that I declined their offer to give me something to change my initial review.  Their explanation for the delivery delay was totally satisfactory to me and I would not hesitate to order from them in the future.  By the way, the product was exactly what I expected and I could not be happier."
"I'm not sure how this monkfruit thing works, and I keep feeling like there must be some trick.... but so far I love this sweetener. It's excellent in tea, on cereal, and on fruit. If anything, it seems to make me feel good. (It is used as a medicine by the Chinese.)<br /><br />My only real gripe is that I can't compost or recycle the foil-lined packets... but that's really not a deal breaker. :)"
This is a great no salt seasoning. unlike other no salt seasoning this does not have a bland taste. I use it for BBQ and baking chicken. The seasoning does not have an overpowering taste nor does it have that funny after taste you get with some no salt seasoning. You can actually smell the garlic and other spices when you open the container. If you are in the market for a good no salt seasoning I highly recommend this.
"As I wrote before, many cans were dented as in careless handling. Also the broth after opening two cans and pouring it in pan looked very dark as in beef broth.  Could the compsny had made a mistake and put the wrong label on the cans?  I cannot use the beef broth.  I have not heard from the company as yet. What are they going to so about this? I cannot send them back as the box has been taken away on trash day.<br /><br />Mildred Smith"
i have been drinking this tea for years and it is the least bitter green tea I have ever tried.  There are 50 bags in a box instead of the usual 24 other teas supply.  Excellent value for the money.
"I love Tahitian vanilla! They are so good that I have just ordered my second batch (and 1 bean is enough to make a 12"" layer cake fragrant)"
Good roast beef from a CAN. I bought this product as a quickie when I did not feel like cooking. I eat smaller meals and I think you could serve three people if you all include 'taters' and a salad! Can be heated in the microwave or on the stove top.
"I love this water.  It's the only water I drink.  I don't like the bland taste of regular water, but I realize we need to drink as much water as possible.  Metromint tastes great and finally enabled me to enjoy drinking water.  HOWEVER, for the first time I bought Metromint from somewhere other than Whole Foods at Amazon and the seller made their own water with a mint taste and poured it into old Metromint bottles.  I couldn't believe it!  Someone actually made their own water with mint and went through the trouble of putting it into old Metromint bottles and sold them on Amazon.  Fortunately I got my money back but beware!!!"
"We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat."
"The milk is as fresh as the one I pick up at the store, that is the reason why I was hestitated to order online however it turned out very good.  The price is good in comparation you pick it up @ the store and it delivers @ your front door.  I would recommend this product to a friend."
AMAZING!  I love this stuff!  Uncovers glowing beautiful skin everytime!  I use it once a week for a real 'treat' pick me up.  Fabulous product!!!
"When they arrive and are fresh, you can't beat them. When they arrive and are obviously old and out of date, you want to beat them just to avoid cracking a tooth. I am thinking about getting away from this product due to inconsistency with Amazon delivery and freshness.<br /><br />I would say: Buyer Beware"
"I love this product! I actually discovered it back in college as it was what my favorite coffee cart lady used in her ""white caps"". It is smooth and has a light flavor. It is sweet enough that you don't need any extra sugar and I like to add just a dash of cream, too. There is no such thing as real ""white chocolate"" so people who are expecting a heavy chocolate flavor might do best to stick with the regular brown stuff. No, it is not great for you, but I cannot imagine anyone that thinks most of the coffee drinks found in your favorite shops are ""good for you"". They are a treat and are meant to be enjoyed as such."
"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys."
"...money wise, in any case. They're much cheaper than in any stores in our area. The only drawback is cleaning them off and breaking off the stems. It might take a while. Otherwise, no complaints. They're delicious after soaking them for about 20 minutes in cold water. I love them in gravies and over potatoes and pasta."
"This is a very tasty, high quality cake. I couldn't be happier with the taste, texture, moistness, ect. I'm sure I will buy this again in the future.<br /><br />The only down side is that they cover it with plastic wrap for shipping and it pulls up on the frosting when removed and it sort of ruins the appearance of the cake.<br /><br />Over all very satisfied."
"This juice is a miracle in and of itself.  It is not a cure all.  My wife used to take high blood pressure medicine, but she no longer needs to.  She doesn't have trouble with heart burn or acid reflux since drinking this juice.  I used to have severe pain in my upper right side (probably gall bladder) every time I would eat--that doesn't happen anymore.  We have both noticed increased energy and we don't get sick as much as we used to.  We are very thankful for the people who told us about XANGO!!"
"I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but purchased this flavor for my husband. He is normally a ""bold"" taste coffee drinker, but says that this is now his favorite. He says it is not too strong and it's not too weak. It's just a nice ""medium"" blend of flavor. Because he was such a bold coffee drinker prior, I stocked up. I keep trying to get him to drink the bold stock and he only says: ""Do we have any more of that Caribou?"". Well, looks like I'll be ordering much more of his new favorite coffee soon!"
"I was happy to see the list of ingredients here listing the peas and broccoli before the pears, thinking that as in package ingredients the larger ingredients are listed first. But after ordering I see on the package ingredient list that, yes, pears are the majority of the ingredients. Common but misleading the way this prodcut description was written."
"Wasn't sure how easy this product would be to locate, was so happy to find it at Amazon. This is a delicious product great for smoothies or sandwiches, the taste is amazingly smooth and peanutty great texture. I would highly recommend it for people like myself that is watching their calories and salt and sugar intake. Amazon is an excellent resource for hard to find products and their service is outstanding."
"Or, as it says on the package Ramyun.<br /><br />Really right spicy. With both a (high salt and MSG) broth package and a dried vegetable packet.  The mushrooms in the packet never cook to my desired doneness, but they are edible.<br /><br />It may say how eccentric I can be that I think these are great for breakfast.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they were on sale when I bought them, and are not available at all just now.  And I'm down to only one package left."
"The Choco Peanut Butter Earnest Eats bars were delicious! I was not able to find this variety at my local store. Amazon to the rescue! My family eats these as either snacks or light meals. At 230 calories, it doesn't ruin my diet either. The bars are soft and chewy with chocolate chips throughout."
"I have used this product before and it is excellent.  Unfortunately, when this shipment arrived the seal on the item was broken and some of the product had already been squirted out of the container into the lid.  I can't use it and according to Amazon's policies (pressurized container) I can't return it.  I can't even request a replacement to be sent - very unimpressed with Amazon."
"I wish you could find more recipes for this product. Translating it over to other recipes, you have to play with the leavening a bit. But when following the recipes written for the product..they turn out great! The chocolate chip cookies are really good. I doubled the recipe and baked in 15x11 pan. Perfect."
"If your grandmother ever told you that if you swallow your gum it will never be digested and it will stay in your body forever, she was wrong, at least when it comes to Steviadent Gum. All natural, nothing artificial, and nothing to feel bad about. And to top it all off, this is really tasty gum! Better than what you can get at the super market in terms of flavor and consistency. Do yourself a favor and try it."
"When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the ""beef and liver"" chunks in the future."
"This Fig Balsamic Vinegar is just wonderful! It is thicker then other balsamic vinegars, but it mixes well with olive oil to make a great dipping sauce. I would highly recommend this. The fig flavor is slightly sweet with a tangy finish."
"If you enjoy a delicate flavor, a crunchy bite, and superb taste, Jules Destrooper cookies will be your choice.  My favorite are the ""butter crisps"", second favorite, ""almond thins"".  Haven't tasted any others but if they are representative, the rest must be incredible!  Butter Crisp Cookies are absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />Difficult to find in local stores where I live so have to order on line now.  Received quickly from Amazon.com.  100% satisfied with service and especially the product! Try 'em, you'll LOVE 'em."
"It's a great, healthy snack to keep around! It's crunchy and not too sweet. Also, if you keep them in a ziplock bag, they retain its crunchiness very well."
"This is a great dog food product - healthy, organic and great for sensitive tummies!<br /><br />Our Lhasa Apso is nine years old, is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach. We started feeding him Newman's Own Organics dog food about 4 years ago and are really, really satified with this product. He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally. I am a Prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping. I will certainly order it again when we get close to running out.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!!"
"as the rest...  Have been taking the product for over 3 weeks.  Didn't notice any improvement or change in anything, and it tastes AWFUL>"
I am super happy with this product. I am currently deployed to afghanistan and I am a very big health foods person. Any one who has deployed knows the chow hall is not so healthy and frankly not to good of food. The price of this product was amazing as well as I got it in 7 days. I will def order again and I have already recommended this product as well as amazon to multiple people here. Love it
"I have not ordered yet, my question is, from the description, it is 24 bags at 0.8 ounces. How does this equal 192 ounces in total weight?"
"Believe it or not, I don't really like chips, I don't dislike them, but if I see them at a party, I usually won't have any, I prefer pretzels.  I thought that I would give these a try anyways.  They are really good.  Very light, not greasy at all.  I don't like sweet potatoes, but I like the flavor in these chips.  I would encourage all of you and my friends to give them a try.  You'll like em."
"i live in the south and must be honest when i say that this tea is much better than even the local restaurants can make.  it is sweet without being overly syrupie.  i did find out that i have to stir it a little more than i would a regular cup of tea that is warm.  but, that is probably to be expected.  it is good!"
"Grape Hi-chew is THE best candy ever made!<br />It has the taste of concord grapes.<br />It doesn't stick to your teeth, and<br />it isn't as hard as a rock. It is very sweet<br />and tastes like real grapes.<br />This is my favorite Hi-chew.<br />Buy this candy!"
"I picked these up on a whim at the grocery store a couple years ago & was so glad I did! I'm becoming a fan of Barilla products. Their Tortellini with Cheese and Spinach is a family favorite. I haven't been able to find it on the store shelves in my area for quite a few months. I'm happy to see I can purchase it online. We like to serve these with spaghetti sauce. My daughter & I have enjoyed them cold in a chef salad, & I've even eaten leftovers cold right out of the refrigerator.<br /><br />Serving Size - 2/3 cup dry pasta<br />Calories 240<br />Total Fat 8g; Saturated Fat 2.5g; Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 35mg<br />Sodium 310 13%<br />Total Carbohydrates 32g<br />Dietary Fiber 3g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein 8g<br />Vitamin A 2%; Calcium 8%; Iron 4%<br /><br />Ingredients: Semolina, ricotta cheese, egg, sunflower oil, bread crumbs, emmentaler cheese, natural flavor, cheese powder, spinach, oat fiber, whey protein concentrate, salt, potato flakes, contains wheat, egg, & milk ingredients"
"I eat these plain, an ounce at a time, to get my salty-crunchy fix while on WeightWatchers. I think they're pretty darn healthy, and pretty unique. It's not drowning in salt, just enough sea salt to bring out the natural flavors. Honestly they're so good I can't bear to cover them up in any sort of salsa or dip and can't think of any that would both compliment and stay subtle - then again I'm not a huge fan of chips with dips. Just plain chips for me!"
"The first reason why I had even purchased this drink was because of a friend, of a friend, I saw their post on a blog telling people how this drink was ""so good and refreshing,"" that I, myself, wanted to give it a try. They say that you'll never know if something is good or not, till you try for yourself.<br /><br />Amazon took awhile to ship and it was delivered on a day I didn't expect it to, so that worked out nicely. Packing of the drinks was questionable, but I've bought things from Amazon before so that was no real big deal to me. So that was 1 Star.<br /><br />When I first took a sip, I noticed a difference it had from many other ""energy"" drinks I've had before. Lightly carbonated, is a big understatement to me. It felt more like a juice that would always be cold, because the way it has been carbonated made it feel that way. So I don't really consider it to be an energy drink at all. 2 Stars there, tasted better than expected and for 12 bottles, it is a bit pricey but to me, not a big deal considering if this is what I'm paying for, then I'll stop with those other cruddy drinks for these.<br /><br />The last star, over the period of maybe 2 weeks I had finished all 12 bottles and gave some to my younger siblings to try. None of them told me of anything described on the label to have happened to them, but they loved the taste of it. In my opinion, Bliss has the best taste so far and I have tried Sonic as well, and I wouldn't recommend that one. Maybe after the first few days or so, I did notice feeling calmer, energy-wise I did feel like I had more energy to do things that I wanted to around the house and at school. But not by a lot.<br /><br />Reason for not giving that last star. The drink is good, better than I had expected to be, and the price of $2.50 per drink isn't so bad at all. This is considering that most energy drinks now cost in the range of $1.25 to $2.25. So for a little extra, you get something better and isn't hidden in a can where you can't see what is actually in there, plus tastes great.<br /><br />Recently I've just purchased Neuro Sun and Neuro Sleep, so I'll probably end up writing reviews for both of those as well.<br /><br />All in all, Neuro Bliss, in my opinion, definitely is worth the money. But don't go into buying this drink expecting too much out of it, that way when you do try it, it'll end up being better than you what you could have expected it to be. Maybe it'll even surprise you."
"I will definitely have to work on tweaking the amount used.<br />The directions IMO had you using too much, it also left an aftertaste.<br />In my house we are not regular soda drinkers and have been using more sparking water.<br />My kids did not like this flavor, I may try mixing it with something else to try and balance the too strong taste."
"Excellent, truly delicious ....very fresh tasting as well.<br />I will only buy this brand of sauce now.  Give it a try, you'll love it"
"This isn't the one I had ten years ago (brand forgotten). It is nearly OK.<br />Strong after taste , flavor is  fake.<br /><br />If anyone reading this knows what brand is great, please post so I can try out. The original one I tried was incredible, thus my fruitless search for perfection."
"We received a bag of this about a year ago as part of an indian-food gift.  After a year of eating it and loving it, there was no choice but to get more when the original bag ran out.  It's easy to cook, very tasty to eat (just plain with some butter and salt), never gets clumpy, and lasts forever."
"For me the tea has light taste, I drink it once a day for about 2 months, hoping to have better hair and nails (after seeing it on Dr.Oz). So far, I haven't seen the result, yet, but I'm hopeful."
"Good;, healthy snack for those parents seeking alternatives for the junk food their kids think they want."
My grandchildren loves these. I was very surprise amount of packs that was in this box. Soft & tasteful. I recommend this product and plan to purchase them again. The product was shipped and arrived earlier than expected.
It is not easy finding sugar free product with xylital.  These caramels are great tasting - wish they more products with xylitol.  I would not recommend their taffys.
"This is very yummy with a smooth and creamy texture and a subtle hint of pumpkin.  To ensure froth, we first add the power, then about 1/3 water to mix it into paste and finally finish off with the rest of the water and stir.  It's well-liked by my entire household.  The only thing I worry is the amount of sugar but it's not too bad of an indulgence."
"We are currently enjoying the fuhgeddaboutit dark roast & it's excellent! We're not quite coffee snobs, but we're WELL past Starbucks & corporate coffee. I'm always hesitant to try something other than our favorites from our local roaster here in Kansas City, but this dark blend is just excellent. It's smooth, not bitter, and doesn't require me to add a ton of half & half to get it to my liking. I'm really excited to have found another coffee to indulge in - and while it's not local to ME, per se, it's a small local business and I am ALWAYS happy to support small, family run companies. I'm really anxious to try to the Corner Donut Shop blend next. Yay for java!"
"Love, love, love these chips.  They taste so good baked in the oven with cheese.  I am glad I bought the case.  I thought it would take the family a while to go through them but we have already gone through 4 bags.  When my parents babysit it is the first item they take out of the cabinets to snack on while reading.  Great product at an amazing price."
"The Marley coffee is the best aroma and taste. It provides a true coffee experience that lets you know this is special. Myself and family work long hours, so this is our reward every morning and evening. I provide my co-workers and clients the same Marley coffee with its 5 star experience."
"These were awful!  I have had these many time s before but this box was below par and gives both me and my husband strong heartburn.  I would have sent them back but by now, half used, I am just ordering other different ones and putting these in the bun.<br />I wonder if anyone else has had this problem?"
"We had a chocolate tasting party with 10 different chocolate bars.  This was the unanimous favorite, even among self proclaimed milk chocolate people."
"this cereal is the most healthful that i've found.  ingredients are perfect, and there is no added sugar in any form. that's the hardest to find and what i most appreciate. why can't other organic cereal producers omit the sugars?  consumers can always add sugar if that's their preference.  for those who like the oats softened, just add milk and nuke for 30-40 seconds. i sometimes add this brand's milled flaxseed and some walnuts and make it even more heart healthy."
"My American Bulldog, Chaos, loves Dingo Dental Bone. Sadly, the bone is gone within a day because of his teeth! But it's ok because what matters is that he's entertained when he chews on it and does not chew on things that he's not supposed to :-)."
"So my Mom often buys bags of kitty treats for her ""grandkitten""... and I find it so hilarious that if it isnt the Temptations treats in the yellow bag, he will NOT touch them. We can mix different brands together in a pile, and he will pull the Temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others. Its unreal. Either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat-seducing ingredients, or they have some sort of addictive substance in them.... who knows! :) I only give them 4 stars because they are not the ""healthiest"" treat for a cat, but honestly... he just loves them so much I cant say no."
"Not good, product was old and nearly passed due, poor quality and taste when compared to a fresh product. The product seemed dry and the taste was inconsistent with previously purchased, fresher products."
"WOW!!!  This cake is the best cake I have ever had, with or without booze.  Deep chocolate flavor, moist and very succulent.  Ordering more right now."
When I went to Mardi gras 2008 I discovered this amazing drink concoction at Pat O'Brien's on Bourbon St. We drank these every day we were there (5 days) & couldn't get enough of them. If you like fruity drinks you will love these. When I was talking to the bartender I asked him what liquor I should put in this mix. He suggested either Bacardi 151 or Myers dark rum or a little mix of both. I highly suggest this mix it truly is the best & brings me back to bourbon st every time I drink one!
Awsome product.They are so good you can eat them in a bowl with a fork. Could be just a little hotter but very good.
"If what you are looking for is raisins and peanuts, the Emerald Hartmony Raisinberry Nut trail mix is fine. There are plenty of good quality peanuts and raisins in each package (9 oz.). But don't buy this if you really want cranberries, almonds or cashews, because there are very few of these treats. The yogurt covered raisins are very sweet. My carton was delivered on a sunny September day and when I opened the psckage 90 minutes after taking the carton out of the sun, the yogurt raisins were still melted."
THIS WAS THE EASIEST WAY TO PURCHASE QUALITY PINE NUTS AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.  THE PINE NUTS WERE DELIEVERED AND WERE IN GREAT CONDITION.<br /><br />THIS DEFINITELY THE BEST PLACE TO GO IF YOU LOVE TO BAKE WITH PINE NUTS.
"Eso es el mismo producto que puede obtener en Mexico, pero mandado a su puerta. I have a friend in the States who loves the candy, and this is a much cheaper option than spending lots and lots of money shipping it from Mexico yourself. The package comes with twelve 12-count bags, for a total of 144 mini canisters -- it's a great deal for the price in my opinion."
My husband drinks these every morning (he doesn't like coffee) so getting these delivered to our front door with free shipping is AWESOME! Save us money too cause it keeps him out of the stores in the morning where usually he is tempted to buy other stuff like junk food!
This is the best k cup coffee that we have been able to find.  Very rich flavors and a medium + roast.  We love this one!
"I get tire of running to the store to get supplies for my cats, especially since I live 20 miles away from the nearest Walmart and sometimes the winters are not the best. I did a lot of looking around for cat food that I could have delivered that would be appropriate for my cats, and either the same price as it would be at the store (or hopefully cheaper). I am spending the same amount of money that I was before, only I don't have to worry about running out and having to buy an overpriced bag of cat food (often not the brand we normally use) at the grocery store in my small town due to bad roads keeping me from running to Walmart. Both cats love the food, and beg for it when their bowl is empty.  I like knowing that I won't run out so easily , and have the convenience of having it delivered to me.  I did the same with cat treats (subscribe and save), now if only I could find kitty litter that I prefer to use that was affordable to have shipped, but no luck there so far. I keep hoping that Amazon will get more subscribe and save products. I check often (crossing my fingers for the kitty litter that I normally use to show up at a good subscribe and save price)"
"I'm gluten free and on the go. Grabbing this on my way in or out is a quick and easy way to ease hunger or cravings.  And it is so good for you, too!"
"I agree with the other reviewer in that the large candy companies just can't compete when it comes to one thing: quality.  How would they?  They're in the business of mass production.  That's why this small-town, small-batch-made candy is the best you'll ever taste out of a package.  It makes the other candy companies pale in comparison.  Being from Ohio, I also grew up on Mallo cups but found it hard to find in DC/Northern Virginia, though it's at some Mom and Pop convenient marts in the country.  Still, now that I can purchase online, I plan to dole it out to friends and family to get them hooked and then tell them how to order themselves so that this company never goes out of business.  At least not if I can help it.  You won't regret trying this product if you never have."
I finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that isn't too sweet. I made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip I was hooked. From now on this will be the only hot cocoa I drink.
These dried chicken breasts are a healthy treat. They are expensive so my dogs each get 2 a day. Happy Hips are $16 a bag in grocery and pet stores so 3 bags for $30 is a real deal and they are worth it.
"I ordered this item with hesitation. My daughters both love everything to do with bananas so much i decided to order it for the new year. I was pleasantly surprised. The shipping was fast and the items were packed excellently! I ordered 3 bottles of banana and 3 of watermelon soda. My total shipping was just over $8 because of ordering a higher quantity of these sodas. They both tasted great! Very light on flavor, not overpowering or heavily fake, but very nice and lightly sweet. They were great! The items were so securely packed it would have taken a lot to damage them. I was very well pleased. AND THE BOTTLES!! These were the most unusual glass soda bottles I have ever seen. The top plastic piece comes off and reveals a plastic break off tool to use to open the bottle which is sealed by a glass bead. You push the tool onto the  bead and it pops inside the bottle and is securely kept inside the upper portion of the bottle. The experience of opening these sodas was as enjoyable as drinking them. I will purchase them again!!"
"I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption. However, these bars really do taste yummy! They are soft, chewy, sweet & fresh. My husband and I love them, and I have gotten a few friends hooked on them too!"
"This wheatgrass grows itself. I load a shallow tray with dirt, add fertilizer, fill it with seeds, lightly cover with more dirt,water and thick wheatgrass in 7 days. What's not to like?!"
"Well, what can I say. It's oregano and it's a lot of it. I think I'll die of old age before I consume this whole thing. The weight looks like this isn't too much, but it's dried leaves, very light. Oregano is supposed to be very high in antioxidants, so there you have it. I have to say that all these health-related rules of thumbs are confusing, and you can find reports claiming directly opposite things, for example, isolated antioxidants (pills, basically) don't seem to do squat in humans (in petri dishes they do work). But when consumed as food they seem to work, and oregano is very rich in this stuff. And, all else aside, it tastes great, so this option here is clearly recommended, at least because it's cheaper than buying small jars in stores. I'm very satisfied with this product, and I will gladly reorder (assuming I live long enough to need a refill!)."
"I bought this on Amazon becuase it disappeared from real stores. In comparison with the tea that was available in regular stores, this one has a sour off-taste, presumably, due to its oldness."
"These taste great, and they are so airy like cheetoes puffs but not all greasy.  Sodium is lower than most other salty snacks but still sates my craving.  Great product!!"
"Except for the promise of a wider variety of flavors in this order of Belly Flops, I really love them.  They have the most original and distinctive tastes and are truly full-bodied."
This tea is so good. It has a strong vanilla flavor and mixes well with half and half. It's almost like a desert by itself.  Delicious.
None better in my opinion. My daughter and niece agree with me. No rubbery texture. Very sweet.
"These are delicious and amazon's price is great! The batch I got has an expires in July 2013, which I think is very reasonable."
"I am deployed overseas and these noodles keep me going. The flavor is robust, the noodles are fresh and the size is plentiful. I order them by the case!"
I do not like the chips! They are not to my liking and I do not think I will order them again even though I like sweet potato!
couldnt find schwepps bitter lemon any where so i tryed the fever tree bitter lemons this is great stuff
"This flavor tastes very good. Great product!!! I subscribed to receive one box every 6 months, very convenient and great service."
"The Dark Magic was highly recommended by others, and I tried it. It is really good coffee, in both decaf and regular. It is my K-cup of choice for a great cuppa joe on a break from a busy day.<br />On special occasions I like the flavored stuff, but when you want a good, honest cup- this is it for me."
I was so happy to be able to find this on Amazon.  No store within 50 miles of my home carries it anymore.
"These snacks are great for kids.  My three year old is very picky, and he loves them.  They are easily portable, since the bag is resealable.  I like the fact that there are no additives, it's just fruit.  Highly recommend them to all."
"This smelled great, but was waaaaaay to gingery for me.  The ginger spice was so ""hot"" that it made the product difficult to drink.  Was not a fan at all."
"I love the Ka-Me seaweed flavored rice crackers.  Until now I could only find them when I visited Florida.  Now that I can order them on Amazon.com, I will be doing it regularly.  As a bonus, they are less expensive ordering them than purchasing them in the grocery store."
"This drink is tasty and made with some pretty simple and natural ingredients. However, carbonation is added (in true kombucha it is a natural part of fermentation) and the drink is obviously pasteurized, which destroys any live culture (and thusly the probiotics that make kombucha popular as a health drink)."
My kids love these and I love giving them a treat that is not full of artificial junk. I have also tried them and they are very good.
"This looks great in my kitchen, and holds a lot of k-cups. It is not flimsy, and I think It will last for a long time, If you want a nice looking k-cup holder, I think you should get this one."
Not what I was expecting and will not order again. I was looking for dried fruit. This product was powdery and what wasn't was hard.
"REALLY great gluten free cookies.  The taste/texture lead you to believe they are ""regular"" cookies.  Have had my sisters, who are NOT celiac try them and they loved them.  These cookies are the closest thing to ""REAL"", not GF cookies. Love them!"
Brought several trees they all died within 4 month's. I have a lot of experience with both Bonsai and Orchids. I have some who are over 10 years old. Maybe it's the shipping or the fact I brought them when it was cold i'm not sure. But I won't buy them that way again.
"It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion."
"And we have tried a few. This tea is flavorful but does not have a strong medicinal odor, it is smooth and balanced. Presentation is good also, including the tea bag, the string, the sealed individual packaging. We purchased a four-box package and shared; Will be buying again before we run out. A very good product!"
"This was much chunkier than I expected.  Our baby still can't handle lumpy food, so he wouldn't eat it at first.  But after I pureed it smooth, he loved it."
"The only question I have each time I take the pitch is...Golazo Energy+Hydration or Golazo Hydration?  The mango lime flavor is fantastic and I really like the all-natural approach.  This stuff is way better than Red Bull, Monster, etc."
"I was pleasently surprised about how soft this cookie was.  It had great flavor, I couldnt even tell there were raisins in the cookie, which is great because I dont normally like raisins.  I like that they come individually wrapped so that all the cookies don't dry out when you want to eat one.  Great snack to take on the go!"
"This tea is so refreshing on a hot summer day, I love it iced with stevia. I haven't tried it warm yet though I think it would be good."
My 7 month old golden retriever enjoys these treats! They have helped with training and she basically inhales these when I give them to her.
"Since we have not heard anything from the person we gave the gift to, we don't know if it arrived well and was as good as we've known the Smokehouse brand/company to be.  When we do hear we will review this gift package.  Thank you. freda+"
"I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink."
Arrived even earlier than expected.  Product has a pleasant taste (unlike many other green protein products).  Will use vendor again.
Happy Squeeze Pumpkin is my absolute favorite snack to have during the day. It has to be refrigerated for the best flavor. I also reach for these when a need a quick snack late at night but do not want something heavy. Plus it is only 90 calories!
The power citrus berry is the best flavor of all.  It is so hard to find.  I just want to be able to find enough to keep me supplied at all times for 2 bottles a day.
"I own a very active, healthy border collie/bulldog mix that is 2 years old.  Nine months ago I switched her food from IAMS Healthy Natural dog food to Taste of the Wild and I couldn't be happier with the results. Her coat improved in its shine and texture, her energy level improved and she became slightly leaner. She enjoys the taste of her food and I have been able to free feed her without her putting on excess weight. I highly recommend this brand of dog food."
"This is a nice berry flavored tea, with some hints of other themes. It is pretty straightforward, definitely not a ""complex"" tea. It tastes mainly of strawberry, but there are other flavors in there as well. Overall a great taste when you're looking for a fruity kick.<br /><br />Also note that this is a caffeine free herbal tea, so you can drink it whenever you want!"
These Kashi bars are wonderful.  Heat them a little and they are almost like a cinnamon roll.  You will love them.
"I drink it before the gym.<br />I drink it on a whim.<br />I turn it into shots.<br />I drink this stuff a lot.<br />I think this stuff's the bomb.<br />Drink on, drink on, drink on."
"Bottom line - our dog loves these treats.<br />They are light and crunchy, unlike some other brands that have more moisture in them."
"My cat deemed these treats fit for hockey games only.  He wouldn't eat them, but had no problems shooting them under my couch."
"I use spelt flour for a lot of my cooking and this company has this 25lb bag, it helps to get a big bag, and they do a great job with the process of making this flour."
"$60?!?!?!  I just bought this at my local Wal-Mart last night for $12.99.  Yes... I got the ""rare"" orange one for 13 bucks.  Perhaps it is not so ""rare"" after all."
"One of the best flavor K-Cups available. Fast, accurate delivery and a great price for the product. Would like to see this same deal available in the French roast version"
"Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!"
"I have been giving my dog these treats since she has been a puppy.  She loves them and were great rewards for her training.  Best of all, they have kept her teeth and gums clean and free of plaque.  I recommend them to all dog owners.  Buying them from Amazon on a recurring basis has been a lifesaver.  These treats do not last long on store shelves so finding them locally has been difficult.  Thanks Amazon for solving my source problem!"
"I discovered these in a local health food store when I began searching for seaweed products as a way to add some iodine to my diet. The store carried lots of products, but most were processed with nasty canola oil which I try to avoid as I do all the high-PUFA oils. Then I found SeaSnax which use olive oil!<br /><br />I bought some and the rest was history. Now I buy them in bulk from amazon because the price is much better. Yes, they do have a slightly fishy odor and flavor - but I *like* that. You may not like them as much as I do if that bothers you. But for me they are the perfect snack - great taste, a nice crunchy mouth-feel, low in carbs and calories. No matter what your eating goals or eating style - low carb, low cal, low fat, vegan, etc. these snacks can fill the bill, but you *must* like that slightly fishy taste and scent. However in my case I do!<br /><br />I eat these so often that it's great amazon has them in bulk like this, although my most recent purchase was a 6-pack and not a 12 as I wanted to buy ALL the flavors, not just the plain, so I bought 6-packs of them all. But I'll certainly be ordering again soon. These are one of my favorite food finds of the year."
I tried this decaf for the 1st time and will order it again.  It is not as strong as some but it still has a robust flavor. Very good value for the price.
"We have a semi-automatic espresso maker and this is what goes in it.  Amazing flavor, no bitter undertones at all, beats the local coffee houses' espresso (which was unexpected for pre-ground).  5 stars!"
"well, here's what happens when you mix Handi-Snacks and Oreo - you get a snack that is actually pretty tasty and fun to eat!"
If you're looking at this you probably already know you like these chips.<br />This is a great deal and I have not had any problems with them going stale.<br />The 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
"For years, I could only find the chocolate flavor at one grocery store.  Then I panicked when I discovered that this store no longer stocks it.  My reaction was to ""Google"" it and, lo and behold, Amazon to the rescue!  This is a quality chocolate malted-milk mix.  It tastes wonderful not only in milk but in non-dairy milk as well, such as soy and rice, so even those who are lactose-intolerant can indulge in this treat!"
"the gum is too sweet,and doesnt last like it used too.. i tested it and in 2 hrs,the gum starts to get really hard to chew,plus the taste is gone.. had to spit it.. i bought another flavor ahead of this,and that one was longer lasting.. i grew tired of chewing it.. just to see how long it will last,but i didnt last! so i guess that's a good review"
Have tried this brand before and love it. These cookies are really good. Will try more from this brand. They know cookies.
"We've given our dog Zuke's Hip Action for about two years. She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term. The Hip Action product is working for her to keep her free from pain and very mobile. It has made a great difference in her quality of life - plus she loves getting her 'treat' every day!"
"I just tried the nutty marshmallow and it is awesome.<br />I have problems with some bars due to acid reflux and also gallbladder problems, but this hasn't bothered me yet. Plus at 150 calories it is a pretty lightweight snack, though a little small. Vegan too for those who want vegan treats. It's not made from real marshmallow root (which I was hoping for), but then almost no marshmallow snacks are."
"The Chocolate is very good but the box it comes in is only 176g with 22 pcs, not 240g as show on the website.<br />If you calculate the 100g price of $5.62 up to the 176g box you get the price of $9.89 which is correct.<br />As a customer I saw the 240g and somewhere that it contains 33 pcs so I ordered 12 boxes (for a show we will attend) to get roughly 396 pcs which would last as for the 3 day show. Now that it only has 22 pcs I am 132 pcs short, so I will have to re-order an additional 6 boxes."
"Corn flour isn't treated with lime.  Treating corn flour with lime gives it a fairly distinct bitter aftertaste and a more dense construction.  Chocolate chip cookies made with masa harina, which tastes like the tortillas it's meant for? Little bitter bricks with chocolate chips.  eek.<br /><br />(I wish it were corn flour.  As of this writing, none of the major mills in the Americas--that means North and South--make gluten-free corn flour.  Not even Bob's Red Mill is, anymore, bless them for having the integrity to say so--although I hear you can order it from someplace in Canada.)<br /><br />*This is where we cut to the clueless Texas Roadrunner face.*<br /><br />This is masa harina, sorry guys."
"I ordered these, after they came, found that ginger is the 4th ingredient. Can't taste the ginger at all. I have purchased other brands, where the ginger is second ingredient, they were good. These were a real let down.<br />The vendor was very gracious and allowed me to return them for a full refund."
I've tried other tripaks for my 4 oz popper but keep coming back to great northern. I don't mind spending more to get better popcorn but as of yet I haven't found anything that was worth the higher price. The premeasured tri-paks are simple to use and insure a consistent quality.
"Great product.  Great taste.  Great choice.  The K-cups make it even better.  So convenient.  Great invention!<br />Will definitly buy this product again, and again."
"Great product, extremely fresh.  A must have for fresh ice cream and creme brulee.  Will order again soon.  Excellent product."
"I use this base all the time but buy it at a local grocery for under $4.  If it weren't overpriced on Amazon, I'd buy it."
"I've tried just about every flavor out there that i can find of Izze Sparkling soda and I've loved every sip of it. Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water. The blackberry flavor is a blend of grape, apple, lemon, raspberry and, of course, blackberry. The mixture together seems to taste as much like blackberry as popping a fresh punch of blackberries into your mouth.<br /><br />The sweetness is the natural sweetness of fruit, and there is nothing added to make it artificial tasting. This is a super substitute for ordinary sodas. It's a much healthier choice!<br /><br />Very highly recommended!"
This vanilla is delicious in all my recipes. It came right on time and was well-packaged. It is a good price for the quantity and great quality also.
"This set comes with four different coffees.  Here's my feedback on each.<br /><br />Green Mountain Nantucket Blend: This is probably the best of the bunch.  Just an all around good coffee without being overly rich or laced with any extra flavors.  It smells great and tastes smooth.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics Special Blend: This is my second favorite.  Paul may be known for his salad dressing, but he also makes a good cuppa.<br /><br />Caribou Blend: No complaints, but it's nothing special.  Just a regular run of the mill coffee.<br /><br />Tully's French Roast: This is my least favorite of the bunch.  The coffee seems a bit watery and bland.  I never have been a fan of French roast so that may weigh in on my opinion.<br /><br />Overall this is a good collection of K-cups for your morning coffee fix.  Perfect for someone who doesn't want any flavored or frilly coffee, just a straight up good cup of Joe."
"I love having something in my pantry I can take out and munch on without guilt--this is exactly my kind of snack.<br /><br />The best thing about Healthy Grains Clusters is how healthy they are. They're made with whole grains, including quinoa, one of the healthiest grains out there. The flax seeds are an excellent way to get important omega-3 fatty acids into your system.They're also a very good source of fiber. Best of all, they're made with all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />Besides being good for your diet, these crunchy clusters are addictively good--both by themselves and as a yogurt topping. I wasn't sure how'd they would actually taste, as I've had plenty of bland health foods. They turned out to be one of my new favorite snacks!<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent granola that satisfies your sweet tooth."
TULLY'S COFFEE IS A WONDERFUL BLEND!  It tastes great and is the first thing I head for when I wake up in  the morning.  The 24 K-Cups for Keurig offers a variety of blends.  I was surprised to see that Amazon carried this product. If you're looking for anything try Amazon first.
This is one of the best hot sauces I've ever had!  It complements most meats and snacks like natchos and chips!
After trying several different types of whole grain pastas - this is it! Even my picky 15yo son loves it.  This is now the only pasta we ever use!
"These are decent ... and MUCH better than the other think thin bars. However, the #1 ingredient is PEANUTs. I'm not sure that ""mixed nuts"" is apt but it's tasty for being so low in sodium (90mg) & sugars (3g) and gluten-free. I'd buy them again but would wait until they're on sale.<br /><br />Nutrition: 190 cal, 11g fat, 10g protein, 5g fiber<br /><br />Major Ingredients: Peanuts, soy crisps, almonds, chickory extract, cashews, maltitol, brown rice syrup, honey, soy lecithin, flavoring, salt."
This has got to be the best black licorice in the world as I consider myself quite the connoisseur of this fine product!
These are the best crunchy granola bars I've tasted. They are excellent alone or with a nice cup of coffee. Highly recommended!
"I really was expecting some nearly straw-like hard thing. I was expecting NOT to like it.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, it was actually very good with quite a few nice flavors-coconut, chocolate, oats, etc. that all came together well.  (And I'm like Mikey on the old Life cereal commercials-I don't like these things usually.)  But, I was looking for something tolerable to eat on the run or at the desk. It certainly is tastier than that.<br /><br />The nutritional analysis is pretty good.  At 180 calories and  9 grams of fat, it probably is most appropriate as a snack substitute, commuter or travel tidbit, or as a meal component with your tea, coffee, milk & fruit. If you're hungry & want something good, healthy, and quickly, this is a good choice.<br /><br />No trans fat, but be aware it is not low-fat.  No Vitamin C, minimal calcium but a good source of fiber and whole grain.  Good source of Omega 3 Fatty acids, low source of protein (2 g).<br /><br />So enjoy it as a healthy, tasty source of fiber and Omega 3 Fatty Acids, but you should look elsewhere in your diet for protein, Vitamin C, Calcium-not significantly fortified there.<br /><br />But, hey, it's much better than a standard cookie and tastes just as good or better!"
I absolutely love Enjoy Life products!! These cookies are a staple at our house!  You would never know they are allergy-free!  They have great flavor and a wonderful crunchy texture!  I am so thankful for this company and this product since we are an allergen free family!
IF you want to change you life for the better and loss weight naturally this is the product for you.  Highly recommend.
"So my husband and I have been receiving Zico water with mango for several months, with subscribe and save. This month both cases taste HORRIBLE.  Expiration date is in just a few months.  In the past they were over a year away.  Also the cases were different in color.  Tasted no hint of mango, but cannot drink this batch.  What is up with that?  We love this stuff and have come to depend on it for after exercise."
"As much as we liked Lindt chocolates, I am very disappointed that I need to leave this kind of review.<br /><br />Those of us that come from Europe know what good chocolate should taste like. It seems that Lindt is getting too americanized.... chocolate is too sweet and no flavor. Too bad!"
"We absolutely LOVE this coconut oil....and the price cannot be beat!!  My husband is weird,in that he'll cook eggs in it(YUCK!) but I love to have it on waffles or toast,or even yams. I also love to use it on my skin,because it's sooooo good for it! The consistency of the coconut oil at room temperature makes it easy to spread....if it gets too warm in the house,though,the oil does turn liquidy,which can be disconcerting. All in all,coconut oil just can't be beat!"
"The box it came in was roomy enough, that was not the problem. But something caused a hole in the couscous bag, and couscous was all over the box and other items,the couscous bag should have had a double wrapping to prevent this problem from happening. I have purchased this product before, and I love it. But I think Osem should make more of an effort to keep foods sanitary. This is the reason I gave it only two stars."
"My daughter asked for fortune cookies for Valentines. I found these on Amazon. They are absolutely delicious!! I highly recommend them and will be ordering more, myself."
"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."
My brother a culinary chef used these cherries for my birthday cake; a black forest cherry cake.<br />He used the juice to baste the cake before layering the vanilla bean whipped cream and cherries.<br />The cherries are so incredibly decadent. The flavor is amazing and the fruit is not like regular mushy canned cherries. They are firm and retain a great shape. They are very sweet and perfect for any special occasion.
"As a coffee drinker, the flavored coffees have never really appealed to me. But after a colleague brought some of the coconut creme coffee to work, I found the coffee to be unlike any other flavored coffee I had had. It really struck a fancy with me, and when I got home that night, I ordered the Coffee Masters Coconut Creme and enjoy every cup of it. It's good coffee and the price is fair."
THESE ARE GREAT. MY KIDS LOVE THEM AND THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME LOOKING AT THE ANIMALS. PLUS THEY ARE A MUCH HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER COOKIES! BUYING FROM AMAZON IS 1.00 CHEAPER THAN THE GROCERY STORE. I EVEN LIKE THEM. THE BAG DOESN'T STAY AROUND FOR TOO LONG THOUGH.
"What a beautiful truffle- They are beyond heaven.  I took them to the shoppe I work at and yum yum, everybody liked them.  They are VERY VERY delicious!"
"I love this product and as you know from the title, I could not wait for it to arrive. Smells great, taste great and all of the popcorn pops in my popper. I joined the club."
I am a coffee person and had to cut back on the caff- when I found that the K-Cups had half the Caff I Tried it and it is great. Thank you
"These cookies make a great snack,or a light treat instead of dessert. It is a fun gift to give, the size and the animal crackers always bring a big smile."
I love this gum and it last quite a long time.  Best way to buy is in bulk so buying the 10-pack is well worth it.
I have really finiky eaters but so far they have loved all these fun bites products. Usually they would just turn their nose up at dog treats but they chew and chew on these and it's good for their breath and teeth. They last quite a while too.
I am very pleased with this purchase. I have made tea everyday since it arrived. I will order again when I need more.
Heloooo people do you read the ingredients?  Zico is made from concentrate!!! I drink Vitacoco because it has one ingredient NATURAL COCONUT WATER.  Zico is a no-go....
"I bought this as a gift so I don't know how the stuff tastes,<br />but there's a good variety of stuff and it looks nice and spiffy.<br />It's not as big as I thought yet not that small either.<br />Basket is Sturdy and it's shrinkwrapped nicely so it's a plus.<br />My recipient said ""WOW"" when he saw it.<br />I give it 3.5 Stars so yes go buy it if there's no other baskets."
"I don't think it looks or smells particularly appealing, and I have not tasted it. My son, however, thinks it's darn near the best stuff in the world.<br /><br />After he had some at a friend's house and came home raving about it, I (reluctantly) bought a box for his use as an after-school snack. According to him, it's the kind of quick food that staves off after-school hunger so severe that it will actually kill a 12-year old boy if he doesn't counteract it by eating something the second he arrives home. (After all, dinner is still a couple hours away; FAR too long to save a hungry, growing boy from complete starvation.)<br /><br />At his request, I bought him a box of Cheeseburger Mac Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles at our local grocery store. A few weeks later I went back, intending to purchase more. Unfortunately, they were out. I asked a store clerk when they would have it back in stock and was told that *that* product would no longer be carried. None of the flavors. We have two grocery stores in our town; I checked the other grocery store with the same result.<br /><br />Odd. Unfortunate. I suspect that this may prove to be one of those products that just don't make it, for some reason.<br /><br />Too bad. It's great kid-quick food, food that they can make themselves, food they will eat and not toy with before tossing away, and food that actually has a modicum of food value to it instead of a load of completely empty calories.<br /><br />So I'm going online to buy up a bunch of this product before disappears completely."
"This product is one of the healthiest things I eat all day and the taste is great.  Organic whole foods and no sodium.  I eat one shortly after I get to work and I am not hungry before lunch time.  I wish Amazon carried more varieties on a consistent basis. Amazon subscribe and save has the best price I have found. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018KNGDY"">L&Auml;RABAR Jocalat, Chocolate Hazelnut, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 16)</a>"
"Stevia is a healthy alternative to artificial sweetners.  Fast shipping and good service.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028P3CK"">Stevia Packets - 1000 - Packets</a> Buying in bulk saves $$$"
Product was of good quality and delivered on time.  The shipping costs were way out of line.  I would not use this vender again because of the shipping costs.
"I had such a hard time with this fondant.  I have used Wilton for years and have done many good things with it so I decided to ""step it up"".  Boy am I sorry I did.  I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said ""It's fondant!""  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said ""It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!"".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.  I'm exhausted!!  Never again."
"Always the best service dealing with Amazon.<br />Eneril's Big Easy Bold coffee is for the serious coffee lover.<br />Perfect for those who love robust, bold flavor."
"Know what I like about doublemint gum?  It doesn't resemble regular mint flavor at *all*.  Not even a little bit.  Doublemint actually tastes a thousand times better.  But at the same time, doublemint actually makes your breath smell just as great.  Isn't that wonderful?  Wrigley's Doublement gum is certainly for me.  A 15-stick gum pack would keep your minty fresh breath going strong for several weeks (unless you have a gum chewing addiction... then it'd be gone in a few days).  Just don't spend more than 5 bucks.  15 dollars is a major ripoff."
"I received my 3 bottles of this product today.  Upon looking at the label on the bottle, it is only 30% juice and there is sugar and grape juice included as a sweetner. The balance of the product is citric acid as an acidity regulator.  I am very disappointed that this did not show up the description when I ordered it."
"These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies."
"They label this as a granola bar.  They say it has 7 grams of protein like it's a healthy snack.  In fact, this is a chocolate-free candy bar. (Each bar has 220 calories and 12 grams of fat.)  But OMG is this baby worth blowing your diet for!!!  The peanuts and chewy nougat are fabulous but the almonds and cashews really upscale this bar to a whole new level of ecstasy.  Consider it a little bit better for you than a Mars bar and enjoy!  I'm planning on ordering a rail car's worth myself..."
"These are all natural, raw, and crunchy! I usually hate crunchy cookies, but these are more like chips. All those words that usually turn people off, like raw, or all natural, these are addicting! Try some and increase your intake of organic sprouted nuts and seeds, Dr. Oz would approve!"
"I am happy to have found Cat Sure. My 21 year old cat enjoys it, and I am sure it is helping to keep her going."
Was shorted by one bar.  It was supposed to be a six pack of bars but only five were in the ziplock bag they came in.  Hopeing they correct this problem.
"The convenience of these fruit cups cannot be overstated.  And a great help if you need to exert ""portion control"" as well ... Amazon.com had a great price on these and I've decided to ""Subscribe and Save"".  We all need to eat more fruit, after all ... and this makes it effortless.<br />The added cherries are a real plus, as well."
My son loves this stuff.  He likes it by itself or when it's mixed with fruits.  We were initially drawn to it at one of the local big box stores because it is multigrain and has DHA and probiotics.  Compared to plain old rice cereal I think this has been a much better choice.  After finding out that our son loves it we started getting it from Amazon and have put it on subscribe and save.  Our little guy is 11 months now and goes through the 6 pack in about a month.  Great product and a better price then we've been able to find locally (plus the convenience of getting it delivered).
"This is an instant ginger drink in granular form. It is delicious hot or cold, and the the little sachets make it convenient to carry anywhere. I think it would be good sprinkled on hot buttered toast,or as a last minute garnish on a frosted cake. Its a wonderful comfort for someone with a cold or flu, or an upset tummy. A real find!!!!!!!!"
"This was a nice, flavorful tea. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying the Nursing Mom's tea."
"My favorite - very chocolatey, not too sweet (altho sometimes I mix in some extra plain cocoa to de-sweeten it some more). Dissolves well. Fantastic with coffee, and you can always add hot milk"
"Of course, my cats deserve only the best so I began giving them treats to elicit a desired behavior in them.  Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since ""Treat Time"" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?  YIKES!"
"I read the reviews and then went to store to buy product, I had to see for myself what would happen. We didn't get cramps but got plenty of ammo for use in a fart war against each other. The taste was ok, not great. Would eat again but only a small single slice."
"If you love granola, you'll love this cocoa-flavored one from Nature's Path.  It has a very nice cocoa intensity and chunky pieces of dark chocolate.  It's also not cloying in sweetness, which I find off-putting in some granola. It contains some pieces big enough to snack on but it's also lovely with milk.  However, the red berries are almost non-existent.  I've eaten half the bag already and only gotten 3 measly pieces of spongy strawberry that were smaller than green peas. I can barely taste it.  For almost $4 a bag, I expect to see red berries when the package says red berries.  It would have been perfect otherwise.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- delicious<br />- made of whole grains, 0 g. of transfat, low sodium, cholesterol-free<br />- certified organic and non-GMO (made in a kitchen, not a lab)<br />- Nature's Path promises to donate up to $1 million dollars to food banks for every bag of Love Crunch bought.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- not nearly enough red berries<br />- a bit pricey<br />- serving size is a minuscule 1/4 cup but has 140 calories and 55 of those from fat<br />- produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts, and tree nuts so people with allergies - beware!"
just got these 3 jars with exp 11-15-11<br />that is just fine 7 months freshness<br />excellent taste/i believe i remember seeing on tv a taste<br />taste which hellman's mayo won..<br />no complaints<br />nothing wrong with any of my jars<br />used subscribe and save and another promotion coupon from amazon<br />16.26 free ship no wasted gas<br />delighted with amazon as always
"I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8... to get 48 bars, would would be spending $18, instead of $22+ (shipping, tax, etc). Plus, then i can choose the variety of flavors we want, not what is pre-boxed. While some of the bulk items here are a deal, many are not!"
"I ended up choosing this from the numerous mint tea options available on amazon because I'd tried Revolution's Earl Grey before and loved it. This stuff is just fantastic! First of all, it comes in a tetrahedral teabag, as opposed to a flat one. The bag is made out of a sort of nylon-type mesh instead of paper, so you don't get any weird paper taste (it matters more in the more delicate herbal teas than the darker black teas, for me anyway). Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar. Very reasonably priced high quality tea and probably about the best you can do without going loose leaf. Will definitely keep buying this!"
Excellent Quality and taste. Very aromatic and nice consistency. It does have some root fibers (fibrous pulp) though.<br />Good price and Volume.
"These pods are great! Don't allow the $20 price for these to sway you not to purchase them. You will not only save fortune at the end of year but will actually have a superior cup of coffee. These will allow you to purchase the coffee/tea of your choice and adjust the strength to suit you. They fit perfectly in the new Senseo Supreme machine and are a snap to clean up. For home use of pod coffee makers, these are the best way to get the most from your pod machine."
"Received very timely, and packed safely; no burst packaging.  Really glad that these people make large enough buckets of this wonderful treat that it makes it affordable.  Dogs love these little cube treats, and they are always fresh since they are freeze dried."
"Absolutely love this candy.  It's the best and hard to find at a good price.  If you like SweetTarts, but like things a bit more sour, this is the candy for you."
"I have been having difficulty finding this blend at local stores. After trying many different flavors over the past 18 months, I find this the most enjoyable blend yet, followed closely by Kona blend. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this blend at an affordable price."
"Arctic Zero is a tasty frozen treat with very low calories and sugar.  Definitely better when left out of the freezer to melt a lot.  It is icy, not creamy like low fat ice cream, but for 128 calrories in the whole pint, what can you expect?  Good alternative to have on hand when watching calories, but too expensive for quality of product."
"Of course, my cats deserve only the best so I began giving them treats to elicit a desired behavior in them.  Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.

We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since ""Treat Time"" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?  YIKES!"
"Very soft and fresh tasting gummy bears that taste almost exactly the same as the white gummy bears.  Again, it's not exactly the same, but anyone THAT picky should just buy their own damn pack of gummy bears and pick out the white ones that they like.  Finished my first bag, will buy more"
"The ""thick"" Rolled oats does a good job replacing the ""Steel Cut"" which takes<br />so long to cook. I gave a two pounder of this to our neighbor who uses the<br />Steel Cut.  Wouldn't be surprized to see her change to the ""Thick"".<br /><br />steel"
"Don't know WHY this stuff is so horrendously expensive in the grocery stores, for a fraction of the amount you receive from this company.  The price/quality/quantity is a very great value."
"I guess if you like Stevia, it's the best way to go. I just hate the plastic, chemical taste -- certainly doesn't TASTE all natural! I ruined two or three cups of coffee using this stuff. But if you like it, it's a good deal."
"Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Original, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)<br /><br />Tough and chewiness, dry, not too salty, this is one of my favorites. Since the flavor isn't too strong, i tend to eat too much."
"These bars are really fruity and chewy even with all the nuts in it. These are fantastic for snack at anytime, or even for a lunch on the go when you don't have time to eat a meal. I'm so hooked on them, that I'm trying all the flavors. I highly recommend keepings these around."
My very allergic dog loves these treats!  She knows where they are kept and goes right to the spot.  Thanks Plato
"I really like the flavor of these chips/crackers. The sesame seed flavor really pops after a few bites and they aren't dry in your mouth like some other multigrain products. They are a tad stale feeling, but I think that's intended and it doesn't mean they're old. With that said, I enjoyed my first bag. If I see these in a local store I will buy them again."
This is a really good tea.  I am drinking it during my pregnancy to tone the uterus.  Very good taste!
"The crackers were something that we got in FL and ordered when we got home.  The crackers are great tasting, but the shipping allowed them to break up and now we have small pieces of crackers.  They are wonderful, but I will have to find a store that sells them instead of ordering."
"This Stash tea is a good full-bodied black tea.  I'm not much of a tea connoisseur, but this is the best irish breakfast tea I've ever had.  I'm a big fan of Stash teas, especially their black varieties, but this one is my absolute favorite, hands down."
Please specify if these are K-cups. Very confusing. Don't know if they would work with my Keurig Coffee Maker.
"I did not know what to expect after reading many of the reviews. Some were good and some not so much. I decided to try to ignore all I had read and start from scratch. I removed one of the small bars from the box and took off the wrapper. One bite and I was hooked. Being a chocoholic to begin with I knew I could become addicted to these bars. You can read all about the ingredients and health issues etc but I am just going to tell you that these are very tasty IMHO. I could have eaten the whole box full at one sitting. Fortunately, I had enough will power to shelve the remainder of the bars for future consumption as an after dinner dessert. If you like chocolate you will almost certainly like these bars."
"Ortiz is one of the highest quality tuna available anywhere. It is prepared in olive oil and it is excellent for salads and many other dishes. This is not the typical US albacore tuna, this is a much smaller fish which increases the price but the meat is way better than any other white tuna. I am very pleased to see that Amazon keeps a continuous supply of it!"
It's hard to find this peach flavored black tea in the market. I was glad to find it online and at a good price.
"My husband Kurt and I are very satisfied with Now Foods Stevia extract. We are very health conscious. Our products must be healthy, pure and natural. After searching, this is the only stevia we will buy. We recommend it to our family and anyone who wants to stay away from sugar.  Other products are full of chemicals that are worse than the sugar.  Now Foods Stevia extract powder is natural.  We only use about 1/8 of a teaspoon for a full 8oz cup of coffee. Even that may be too much. We buy it by the pound and it lasts a long time.  How can anyone not use this product to substitute sugar?! It is an excellent product. We give it at least five stars.<br />Honestly and sincerely,<br /><br /> Kurt & Linda.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0"">Now Foods Stevia Extract - Powder 1 lbs</a>"
"I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy."
"The only thing that will bring my dogs in the house immediately. If I call ""chicken"" they come running.  Rattling the canister will even tear them away from squirrels and rabbits."
"I've had every type of cover for cat food cans -- these are without doubt the best. It's the material that makes them great. They're so flexible and they grip and seal well. That makes them easy to get on and off, as well as easy to wash. I don't really understand the spoon slot. I've never used it. But it doesn't hurt that it's there. I've had a few of these lids for a couple years. They are my go-to. I might as well just throw out the other lids. I just ordered more of these today."
"I recently tried this soda when I was in NYC in June.  My girlfriend, I and my best friend went to the Carnegie deli for lunch.  I haven't been there in a long time and I asked my friend what he would reccommend on the menu.  He said to get a pastrami sandwich and the cel-ray soda.  I thought to myself, cel-ray soda, yuck as I am not a big soda drinker to begin with and this did not sound too appetizing.  I ordered the Woody Allen which was pastrami and corned beef on rye with cel-ray soda.  The sandwich was huge, only ate half.  The cel-ray soda was simply amazing, a slight hint of celery in a light refreshing drink.  When I got home back to upstate New York, I began to try to find this amazing soda in my area.  I googled it to see who would carry it in my area and it said select Wegmans stores carry it.  I have 5 Wegmans in my area and not one carries it.  The only Wegmans I have seen it in is in Williamsville, NY a Buffalo suburb.  I am lucky I am out that way every few weeks, so I stock up.  Do yourself a favor and try this amazing soda, you will not be disappointed."
"I read the review and I was hestitant as it was reported the drawer did not come out easy.  Well, it comes out easy.  I have room for plenty of choices in the drawer as my family likes hot chocolate and tea.  Personally I like coffee. The best thing is that it is a space saver.  I put the Kcup machine on it and I have plemnty of room for condiments.  With other storage syatems you place it next to the Kcup machine.  This takes a lot of spce.  Space is important in my cottage which is now my home.  I think this was a great buy for me.  It is funny how sometimes you buy something and it turns out to be a dud.  This is definitely worth the money."
"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them."
"My favorite of all the coffees and I've tried a lot of them.  I can't buy coffee out any more, because is just isn't as good as this stuff!"
"Wow--these ROCK!  They are light and fluffy and perfect for spreading all kinds of delicious toppings.  My most recent fav...nuke a few semisweet morsels and peanut butter morsels together and spread on the rice cake.  I know, not very healthy.  Didn't have any Nutella.  Also love with hummus, pimento spread, spinach dip to name a few.  They aren't salted so unless your topping is loaded you don't feel like running for the water trough after :)"
this was a good deal - a lot for your money but it was not the best marzipan - sweeter and less almondy  than some others
"We've enjoyed this tea.  The wooden box is also nice - lightweight and certainly not fancy, but a nice holder for the tea."
"My dog enjoys hiding and then eating the biscuits. I gave Crunch and Clean 4 stars because they don't seem any different than other dog biscuits, but if they really do clean better than most, than add another star!"
"These are the same product as the Bite-Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.<br /><br />The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.  If you can get past that, the taste is unmatched!<br /><br />The Slim-Jim ingredient list was similarly disturbing to me as Slim-Jim has, as separate ingredients ""chicken"" and ""mechanically-separated chicken.""  I don't understand why one or the other doesn't cover both."
"Very good tasting, low fat, low cal, easy to mix, very satisfying protein drink.  It is good hot or cold.  Would buy again!"
"I thought we would give it a try.  It was a good deal, but the fake chocolate has a bitter taste.  We prefer the regular Rice Chex."
I am very impressed with this product (and the company that creates it). The packaging is gorgeous - nice enough to give as a gift as is. And the dark chocolate covered orange peels are the best I have ever tasted. The dark chocolate is rich and flavorful. The candied orange peels on the inside are the perfect balance of sweet and tart. And they're easy to bite into - not hard like some others I've tried.<br /><br />Yes these are pricy but they are truly gourmet. And since the package includes a full pound I believe that justifies the price.<br /><br />I ordered this during the winter so I was not concerned about melting.
"Have had the other flavors , this tastes the worst. Sorry I bought a whole case. Try the variety pack first."
"EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either."
"This popcorn is the best. Say goodbye to movie theater popcorn,and hello to great northern popcorn. My boyfriend, and I pop 2 bags a day. It is so good, that as soon as you finish eat it, you want more. It has enough salt, a buttery taste, and oil. Everything is packaged together. I love it. I'm order more today! I use to go to the movie theaters just to get the popcorn, and leave and eat it at home. I am a popcorn critic in my head, and this is definitely Top 2."
"This is my diet secret> I needed soething salty and crunchy in my bag of tricks to help keep me on my diet, I love these things! Even if I eat a whole large bag it's still about 300 calories! I like all the flavors and I really like the samll snack size bags. I couldn't get them anywhere but on AMAZON!"
"I became aware of Donut House Decaf because Amazon emailed me an ad for it, since I'm a longtime buyer of k-cups.  I'd tried various other varieties of decaf and found them OK but not terribly exciting to the taste buds.<br /><br />Donut House is different, stronger (they mean it when they say Extra Bold)--but not the way espresso or French roast is strong, mellower than that--and more flavorful than the others.  Now I'm a fan, and I hope Amazon keeps carrying it."
"There are very seldom any unpopped kernels, which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. Not a whole lot to say about popcorn. I always buy from you guys and will continue to."
"This was a new product to me.  They were very tasty, crisp, and surprisingly delicious.  I was very pleased with this product."
"I know this product since childhood .. i like it that's why i ordered it (+ i still did not see any similar product here (GA, USA) in grocery stores . I am so glad I found it @ Amazon!!"
"This is a perfectly sized, neatly packaged, fantastically fragrant hunk of hunger-appeasement. Kids will find the plastic wrapper easy to open, and not too hard to crimp shut should they want to save half for later, which they might: dried fruits are always more intense than fresh, and this snack packs a wallop of organic apple puree and organic fruit flavors, bound together with organic apple juice and pectin.  That is some rarified fruity madness.<br />I don't have kids, but if I did I'd sneak these into their backpacks every morning; instead, I keep these in the car and in my purse, for when I get so busy I forget to eat. It happens. I'm blonde. My husband snacks on them before *and* after meals; I can be convinced of their desert-worthiness with a hunk of high grade chocolate sharing their plate.<br />These snacks are a good source of potassium (great for writer's cramp or lost-weekend-recovery), with almost no sodium and very little sugar.  At 70 calories each, they're just the thing when you're too hungry to decide what you want to eat for dinner. Highly recommended."
After eating muir tomato products you will never settle for supermarket brands again.The diced tomato with Italian herbs is heaven sent and also organic so its good for you.
Looking for a quick cook sticky toffee pudding these caught my eye. The only thing that resembles a sticky toffee pudding from this product though is the name. Bland tasting. A disappointment beyond words.
I usually order the Sumatra coffee but I thought I would try this Dark Roast because you get 2 more pods.  It was not nearly as good as the Sumatra.  Very hard tasting and somewhat bitter.
"These taste more like a treat than a health bar.  It's hard to believe they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars are made of Kashi's wheat mix, but it tastes even better with the peanuts.  One side is covered with chocolate.  Sweeter than other granola bars, not as sweet as a candy bar.  Perfect for most occasions.<br /><br />This is the tastiest Kashi product I've tried."
Convenient way to buy GOOD coffee. 1 box last me a month and half. What a savings!!<br />Saving on gas too!!
"This is one of the most natural-tasting fruit teas you'll find.  I discovered it at a local tea house, and was pleased to find it at an incredibly low price on Amazon.  Delicious!"
"this one tastes great, i love those and had just ordered those somewhere else, i didn't know Amazon carried those. they taste light, not to sweet and have cereal puff's on the inside. love them"
THE PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS.I LOVE COCOA AND THE ABSENCE OF CAFFINE ENABLES ME TO ENJOY IT AGAIN.THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SUCH A PRODUCT AS THIS.THANKS FOR PROVIDING IT TO US.
"If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff."
"I found this in my pantry while looking for the Fruit 'n Cream Quaker Instant Oatmeal we usually eat (I like the peaches and cream flavor), and I gave it a shot.  It was so good!  The instructions made it so easy... Basically, the  oatmeal comes in an oblong pouch (paper-feel), you rip it open, dump it into a bowl, fill the pouch with water, pour it over the oatmeal, pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  And tada, hot and delicious breakfast!<br /><br />I usually have a large breakfast, so I use two pouches at once--double oatmeal, double water, put it in the microwave for 3:30 minutes.  I mix in a teaspoon of honey, and it's just right for me with a mug of hot tea.  I've been sick the past few days, and most food has not sat well with me, but this oatmeal has been very easy on the tummy.  Also, it's whole-grain and has flax seeds in it, which adds more fiber to your diet and helps digestion.<br /><br />My only mystery was where it came from.  I assumed it must have been from the local Whole Foods, but they didn't carry it when I asked.  It turns out it was from Target, and my MIL put it in a care package she sent us!  Sometimes mother knows best, I guess. :)<br /><br />The package is kind of small though.  It's compact and a space saver in the pantry, but for someone like me, who goes through oatmeal fast, I wish it were bigger.  I'd be happy if Amazon sold it as subscribe & save with free shipping, as I'd love to buy it in bulk (at least 20ish packets at a time)."
"I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!"
"I love Zico after a hard workout (or before if I haven't eaten).  It immediately re-energizes me, and best of all, it tastes great!"
"If you used to buy Old El Paso Refried Beans with Sausage and liked that product, which they do not produce anymore, this is the next best thing. I tried these and they are very good, better than any home made stuff I tried to do. I tried special ordering with my local grocery, but they said they could not get the product in and Amazon has a better price than the website for Latin Products. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase again."
"9 of 24 were the same thing:  Caramel Vanilla Cream.  And yes, it tastes horrible.  Actually, over half the items were French something, and the rest of the items you got only one of each.  Nor did they come in a box, I got a brown paper bag that someone had thrown whatever hadn't sold well into.  This wasn't an assortment, it was leavings.<br /><br />Both Gloria Jean and Amazon could have done this much better."
"PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks. It's a powdered peanut butter - peanuts with most of the fat removed, plus small amounts of sugar and salt for flavor. The amount of sugar per 2 tablespoon serving is only 1 gram (equivalent to 1/4 of a teaspoon). I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter. My favorite way to eat this is with apple slices, although I've had patients tell me they like to dip their fresh fruit directly into the powder. Amazon seems to have the best prices for this item."
"Not too bad, very cute.  I got these for 6 at an anime convention recently.  The jelly ones are similar to the fruit chewy sugar coated candies in the USA and the breaded ones are similar to Twinkies.  The overall sweetness is about the same as mochi or marshmallows."
THIS IS NOT A PACK OF 12 BUT OF 3. I AM VERY UNHAPPY. PRODUCT IS NOT AS DESCRIBED  DO NOT ORDER IF YOU EXPECT 12 BONES. RIP OFF.  AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
"This is a good mocha but you have to get used to this weird taste that it has. I can't figure out what it is but it almost has a weird texture. However, the more I drink it (I ordered a ton.. yikes) the more I like it.. it is definitely sweet and you don't need to add any sugar but I find it that I like it better with a vanilla-caramel creamer :) I wouldn't buy more than one box.. then if you love it, order more."
"Making scrambled eggs with white truffle butter is a fragrant, heady experience. It goes a long way, can be used judiciously. Is aroma and flavor linger minutes after the last golden morsel is eaten. It an also be enjoyed on fresh pasta."
"We love these snacks! My 3yo and 9 mo both adore these, and I really love to eat them too. They're very tasty and a great snack to have on hand."
"Another winner from Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />The smell of the this particular matcha is tangy and slightly sweet, even though there's no sugar added to the flavoring.  I prepared this my usual way - cold latte style.  Two ounces of warmed water with a teaspoon of matcha and a half teaspoon of super-fine sugar - wisk until blended.  I didn't try sifting the matcha this time, and it frothed up very nicely without any clumping.  Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.  As the cup cools, the tangy taste comes to the forefront with the matcha and the creaminess lags behind.  It's kind of like having two very different teas, which is pretty awesome for just buying the one!  A creamy, dessert-like cup of tangy cheesecake with milk/dairy alternative or a green tea with a little tang - it's up to whatever kind of mood you're in!"
"The first ingredient in this formulation is mineral oil - olive oil is the fourth. I was underwhelmed by the results of using this oil; a little goes a long way but it basically coats your hair.<br /><br />I don't consider mineral oil a ""nourishing"" property. This oil only gave my hair some sheen. I csn't say it contributed to the overall health of my hair any and it definitely didn't diminish the winter breakage. I feel better adding a little extra virgin olive oil to my hair conditioner. That yields far better results."
"It was quite good at the begining, but got tired of 30 bags of instant noodle in the end..."
"First one I had was OK. The second and third tasted better as I had become accustomed to it. My husband liked it too and said he felt a bit refreshed/increased energy after drinking it. But too pricey for what you get. There are less expensive ways to eat/drink healthfully, I think."
If you like Coffee you will love these little candies. Its like having a mini cup of coffee flavor. AND everyone I have given a piece to really likes them. If you like Coffee? Buy em!! I bought 2...
I am not an avid coffee fan but drink it on ocassion.  I use half the packet and it is perfect for my palate.  I buy VIA to have on hand for guests since I don't own a coffee maker.  Worth the extra cost for quality taste.
This special k has bigger crunchier flakes that hold up to the milk regular special k flakes get soggy in milk the chocolate pieces are big but that makes them sink to the bottom of the bowl but I enjoyed this cereal very much
All but a handful of the shipment were defective.  When brewing the water flowed through very slowly and large quantities of grounds were released into my cup - Gross.  The only way to use them is to empty the contents into a reusable k-cup.
"The ""Subscribe & Save"" option is great but would be even better if you changed this to a pack of 4 because I always run out before the end of the month is up! (I use one pack a week) Thank you!"
"These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy."
"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."
I didn't like this brand of coconut water it has a strange after taste.  There are other brands out there that are a lot better.
We LOVE this stuff around my house.  I finally got my husband to switch from his sugary sports drinks to a healthy option.  His favorite is the Pink Guava.  I like it because it has a ton of potassium and other minerals that hydrate me well which is important as I am a full time fitness instructor.  It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.  I enjoy it more than other brands (and I've tried quite a few).  O.N.E. is by far my favorite.
I have two yellow labs - one of which has severe food allergies (ear infections).  I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.  My female lab used to have persistant ear infections but since I started using the Simple line of dog food - the problems have disappeared.  I rotate between the duck and lamb flavors and she seems quite happy.  Never tried the salmon flavor.  I also treat both dogs with the Wellness biscuits (peanut/honey is their favorite).  Quality dog food well worth the cost!  My female lab is almost 7 now and the male is 5.  Both love the food and are very healthy.  Thanks Wellness!
"I am so happy to see Belly Flops on line!.Every time my dad goes to CA, we have an order for these. Now we can order anytime!Thanks. Gotta go, need to order some more of these fun, tasty bags!"
"If you're a VIA fan and like Starbucks Italian Roast, this is for you. WAY better than buying all those packs at the store and even Costco. Italian Roast tastes great. My only desire is for Starbucks to offer a 50-pack qty in their French Roast VIA vending packs (C'mon Amazon folks -- send this feedback to the good folks at Starbucks please!). Enjoy your coffee!"
"I have gradually come to realize good coffee doesn't have to bite your head off. People have been convinced that the more your socks curl, the better it is. This is a pretty mellow but substantial brew. It doesn't have the hardcore after taste and isn't bitter. No fruity or whatever else descriptors. It's just a good basic cup of coffee for the average person. Basic is what I'm looking for in the morning."
Really liked this flavor!  It's a good addition to the coffee rotation. Also smells great on my desktop mug<br />warmer
"I ordered this item, a 10 pound BAG of sour cherry Jelly Belly jelly beans but what I received was a previously opened BOX of jelly beans which were crystallized and melted together and looked nothing like the image above. In addition, the jelly beans were simply dumped into the cardboard box with no wrapper whatsoever. This box had a seal on it which had been cut through and then retaped. The external shipping packaging was undisturbed. When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned."
The juice is excellent! High in natural sugar but the best thing you are going to get without juicing your own. You can purchase 64 oz of this at Sams club for around $7
"This sugar-free berry-flavored ice tea has a refreshing taste.  With separate powder packages intended for single servings, this is a product that's perfect for use at the office or on travel.  My only complaint is that the amount of power seems excessive for a sincle serving, making it difficult to dissolve the entire packet even in a pint-sized glass and leaving unwanted residue in the glass."
"KIND bar is little like fine dinning, they don't give you a huge portion, and its quite expensive compared to others, but the portion they give you is so good. This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well."
from kitten to senior they all love this food in my house they will eat all the fruit pieces first. They are all healthy & happy cats been using this product for years we love it!
"I wanted an inexpensive way for our office to try several roasts.<br /><br />I grew up in New Orleans, drinking french roast or coffee with chicory and, not surprisingly, I liked the dark roast and french roast the best. Both are very good, and the price can't be beat, so I ordered a case of each.<br /><br />I'm not wild about the other roasts, but the other people in the office seem to like them, and once again, the price is outstanding!"
"The first time I had this oil, I was using it as a dip for bread. After shaking the package, I poured it into a bowl and sat down to watch an hour long show with my boyfriend. Who knew that an hour later I would realize that we finished off an entire loaf of french bread and the entire bowl of tomato oil. It's so delicious. I recommend this to anyone who wants an easy meal. I use it as a marinade with chicken, fry it in a pan, then add it to tortellini and use as a sauce. So yummy and takes about 10 minutes."
We love all the flavors of the Organic Smoothie Fruits. Subscribe and Save is the perfect way to get both the Yellow One and Red One on a monthly basis. Our little one just eats them directly from the hard spout.
Bought several of these cakes and was not disappointed. Most delicious and moist cake I've ever had. Will definitely buy more again!!!
"As a gourmet soda lover and shameless glutton, I've dropped a good amount of coin at my local Wholefoods trying out different beverages... well.. at least the ones that don't cost $5 or more per bottle. On sale, one bottle of Izze is about $1.50.<br /><br />It's fabulous! The soda does taste like clementine. It's all natural, sparkly, and so refreshing. I remembered trying the canned version of this (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans</a>) and not being impressed. The bottled version tastes much better. It's got different ingredient ratios and a different formulation: sparkling water, white grape juice concentrate, orange juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum, acacia, ester gum, beta carotene. Drink it ice cold though, otherwise it doesn't taste that great.<br /><br />Sugar is a bit high, with 120 calories per bottle. 70% juice. One bottle is very high in Vitamin A and gives you 100% of your daily needs. Both are astoundingly good. Highly highly recommended."
"I had already bought this product from another website before and I generally love it. However, the one I bought from this supplier tasted horrible and it also tasted like someone dropped ashes in it.  This comes with 12 packages and I opened 3 to make sure that it was not just a problem with the one package. Because this was so horrible, I could not bring myself to try the rest so the rest of it will be going into the garbage."
Bought for the wife's birthday (she is a nut) and she loved it. Did not share much with me.<br />Making another order.
"After shopping several places for more economical raw cashews than my local health food market, I decided on this item. They arrived quickly and are great nuts, however, my only complaint would be how they were packaged. Five pounds of cashews should be shipped in a proper box -- NOT a priority mail envelope!! I received my package punctured with a big hole, and there was a hole in the bags inside holding the cashews. Not sure how many cashews I lost in the delivery process, but doesn't look to have been too many. PLEASE Bayside Candy: package them better and I'll be a repeat customer and a 5-star rating!<br /><br />Other than the shipping snafu, the quality of these cashews are very good and are working very nicely in my raw food recipes."
I was glad to find a large bag of small bites. This is a really good value for my tiny dogs' favorite treats.
"The crunchy variety is a whole lot better than the chewy variety, if you ask me.  And this is my review, that's my story, and I'm sticking to it."
"Very pleased with this coffee, but there are so many others like it. I would buy it again if price would come down."
"We have the pickiest dog on earth.  It took us 3 years to find a food that he would eat a full bowl of on a consistent basis!  When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-)"
This dog food is a fine product at a good price.  My 4 dogs love it and they eat it up as fast as I serve it.  I understand from some experienced breeders that it is a healthy product.  Amazon shipped it quickly with no shipping cost.
"I, too, bought this at Costco and can't find it there lately. This is the best cornbread mix ever. Moist, Bits of corn in it. Very flavorful."
"I love hot cereal for breakfast, and I've always liked Cream of Wheat but it has almost no fiber in it- 1 gram. Cream of the West has 6 grams of fiber per serving however, and tastes even BETTER. It has a nutty, hearty, delicious flavor but a very creamy texture. You can microwave it in 3 minutes and it doesn't get all those nasty lumps like in C of W, it's so easy! I like to add just a little salt and a dash of cream and it's a scumptious, filling, and healthy breakfast for both children and adults. I love it!"
"It's not too sweet so I like that. The kids love it and let's face it, cookies are generally not healthy, so this is ok, not the healthiest, but good!"
"I really like the flavor of the Breakfast Blend, and I will try the Fog Chaser next. However, I also like the unique cup, which uses considerably less materials than traditional K cups. Although the bottom is a filter, it is not wet when it comes out of my Breville K Cup machine."
This is excellent tea!! Real blueberry flavor but without the caffeine!!!<br /><br />I really like tea in the winter and was suprised when even my kids loved this tea. My 5 year old thought I was making muffins when he smelled it steeping. He tried it and then the rest of the kids had to try it. I now order it here in bulk!!
"I'm always trying to find ways to get vegetables into the small children without causing a standoff at the O.K. Corral.<br /><br />Luckily, mine have become enchanted with snacks that come in squeeze packets, especially the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E0S4UW"">GoGo Squeez Applesauce on the Go</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E0S4YI"">GoGo SqueeZ AppleBanana, Applesauce on the Go</a>.  I thought I would slip pear sauce into the mix without them noticing.<br /><br />Unfortunately one of them can read and he read it and pointed out the words garden greens to his little brother and sister.  Then he pointed out the picture of broccoli on the front.  Both of them looked up at me with their sad eyes that said, ""Why, why would you sneak broccoli into our snack drawer?  Why?""<br /><br />Never let them see you sweat.<br /><br />""You try it!"" ""No!"" ""No!"" ""No!""<br /><br />So I tried it and I tried really hard not to make a face.  I tried really hard to think of it as 2g fiber in 40 calories.<br /><br />It doesn't taste like pears, exactly, but neither does it taste like broccoli.  It kind of reminded me of eating a pear salad on a small table while sitting in a sidewalk caf&eacute; and drinking a tall cool glass of ice tea.  Pureed, though, pureed."
"SO GOOD!!! FINISHED BOTH JARS IN A MONTH! NOW I HAVE TO BUY MORE! OMG!!! Ive been looking for this for so long and I'm so glad I've finally come across it! The best I've had so far! WELL worth it, I am officially a fan for life."
"I like using Miracle Grow liquid food very much.  I just attach it to my hose and water the plants on my deck.  A few times a week, I put the marker on the ""feed"" side.  Otherwise, I just use the ""water"" side.  I am amazed that this is so hard to find in our local stores.  It was easily available for the last few years, now I could only find it on line.  Still, it is the easiest way to feed the annuals on my deck and that is what I use it for most.  Occassionly, I do use it on the perennials in the garden."
"I use this over the organic stevia because it has no bitter after taste.  I use it to sweeten my protein shake, coffee, and the Paleo candy that I make.  If you want he recipe: 1/4 cup raw cocoa, 3 pkt stevia, 3T coconut oil, 1/3 c.coconut, 1/4 seeds and nuts (sunflower, almond meal,hazelnut meal, round sesame seeds, chopped black raisins;cool and eat."
$8.98 for 1 pack?!?  That should be the price for a 6 pack.  Be careful and dont order only one for that price!
"Be aware that Amazon LLC does not include ice packs in packaging and does not refrigerate this product. I will not get this specific brand again, nor purchase items that should be kept cold from amazon in the future. I gave it 2 stars because amazon was quick in replacing it, but food items can't be returned which is what I would've preferred."
"I wanted Old Dutch chips but they were not available,these chips are o.k. but they are too thick."
"This is hands down the best cup of coffee. It helps me not drink a whole pot of coffee, because 1) It is too expensive to drink more than one via a morning. Even though I often cheat and have two. 2) It is so satisfying, i don't need to sit and drink 4 cups of okay coffee to get a good coffee fix. Great product. And AWESOME to travel with. So you can go anywhere and have a great cup of coffee."
Wolfgang's Reserve Columbian Decaf is probably the best decaf we have had in a K-cup. Very good cup of coffee!
I have tried both the Black raspberry and the Orange/mango and loved them both. I didn't care much for the pineapple/coconut or the Strawberry one. But the Black raspberry and Orange are both a great addition if you want something other then regular water but don't want pop.
I have my morning tea every day. It is a great start to a new day. I especially like Twinings English breakfast tea.
My puppy Paw Paw hates this stuff.And I hate it to. It get's my whole house plus the inside of the toy stink. And my next door neighboor dog Fluffy the Bichon frise ate this stuff one time and ended up in the emergenciey room! But she is better but needs to rest for a couple days.
I ordered this item on November 14 and I'm still waiting on it.  Wasn't informed that there would be a delay when I ordered.  I'm getting pretty impatient.
"These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times ""healthy"" or ""good for you"" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.  Serve these at your next party, but make sure you have quite a few bags...you will need them."
"I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price."
The single most delicious thing on toast. Or made into a hot broth..... But you'd have to be English or an Aussie or south african I think to understand that. But all I can say is mmmm mmmm mmmmm
This is a great product - very true as there is not a crash.  I find that drinking it cold is the way to go.  Felt an increase of energy within moments.
It tastes like sugar. You need only few drops and it goes long way. Very easy to use it. I do recommend it.
"I have been feeding this to my dogs for about six months. One year ago my female greyhound was dealing with a rash on her stomach and infections on her feet. I thought I was feeding her a quality dog food. But I was taking her to the vet almost every month. She took antibiotics for almost four months to get rid of the infections. This made her lose her appetite. Then I started her on Wellness Core. She loves it and so does my other greyhound and shephard mix. After six months my female greyhound has no infections of any kind and my male greyhound has a black, shiney coat. My shephard mix is happy and calm. All the dogs love this food. None have skipped a meal since I started using it. I am happy because I am going to the vet only for yearly shots. This dog food is great."
"I truely enjoy this coffee. Vietnamese Iced or just make a cup, it is a delight to drink anytime. Add some to a bottle of water and allow it to steep overnight. Best cold brew ever."
This is my new favorite tea.  It's black as coffee maybe even darker.  It has a very strong flavor.  You will either love it or hate it.  The tea leaves are allowed to decompose or compost a bit.... it is weird but it makes a amazingly powerful tea.  It is supposed to promote weight loss if you want to use it for that reason.
"My husband thought it was funny that I asked for this on my Wishlist, and thought it would take forever to go through 36 packets, but it's taking me no time. I was looking for an alternative to soda at work with lunch, and Mio is okay, though I haven't found it in lemon flavor at the store. Saw this lemon-lime, and I don't regret it. The flavor is great, and the packets couldn't be more convenient. I tuck one into my purse when going out to lunch and put it in water, or just add it to water from the cooler at the office. Definitely makes me drink more water than I would otherwise. I like it at the sweetest ratio on the package, though even that is not overwhelmingly sweet--it's low-level sweet and tasty. Didn't like it higher dilutions--seemed to give it a bitterness.I'd like to try different flavors now."
"I read about this on a diabetes forum and decided to try it out.  I have a history of gestational diabetes, so when I found out I was pregnant again, I became very interested in lo carb options to control my diabetes through diet.  These are great!  I was warned about the smell, so a quick blanch took care of it.  I did a peanut chili sauce and I loved it.  Am going to buy loads more.<br /><br />Pros: lo carb, easy to prepare<br />Cons: texture is definitely more rubbery, not exactly like regular wheat pasta"
"to the best of my knowledge Maple syrup from Canada only needs 80% maple to be considered pure. NY 90% , Vermont 100%  I wonder if this product ignores Canada's Standard."
"Really easy to prepare and very yummy. With my microwave I put them in for 1:40 and they turn out perfect. Warm, crunchy and tasty. And without the carbs, they don't impact your blood sugar which is a real boon for us diabetics."
"There was a little damage in shipment which might be expected, but it is growing and catching flies...with a little help!"
This is a deliscious drink.I have trouble keeping it in stock because all my friends and family go for it the moment they come into my house. Perhaps it wouldn't need tp be quite sp sweet. It is awesome.
Just how I like it! I can make a large cup of this on my Keurig (the one with three cup sizes) without losing any flavor. No nasty aftertastes and not bitter. Will order more.
"I first learned about Milo in Canada from some Australians, and just loved it with coffee.  Two weeks of the combo up there on a guided camping trip and I was hooked enough to buy some online here in the States when I returned.  I have not tried it as a hot or cold chocolate drink, but using one mounded tablespoon in a latte cup of coffee is delicious.  Perhaps it is like a mocha (have never tried one), but so easy and SOOOOO GOOD.  I believe a 14.1 ounce container will last two months for 1 person using it as I did and once a day.  In addition to the flavor, I like the fact Milo also contains a combination of B vitamins and magnesium, which according to the label helps release energy from proteins, fats and carbohydrates in food. I never drink my coffee at home without it!"
I bought these because of the amount in bag - they were tougher then the ones i get locally - they get better after spending the night in the refrigerator - but would not recommended if eating fresh.
This is an excellent cereal to give baby after rice cereal. It is easily digested and helps if your baby gets a little constipated. My baby loves the flavor and the best part is that it is organic. I highly recommend this cereal.
"I found the bars to be moist and taste good, the downfall is that they want to fall apart as soon as you open them which makes it hard for my boys to eat without making a huge mess.  If that is not an issue for you definitely worth a try."
this flavor is soooo good!its very smooth and the flavor is not too strong. its just good! its a regular in our house now. everyone loves it.
"Our dogs don't always like the dry food we buy, and canned food often upsets their stomachs, even the premier brands. Purina One works well for them and they like it."
"My friend and I are always looking for a new healthy snack...We ordered the variety pack...She'll order again , I WON'T..."
"My family loves the Kitchens of India chick pea curry, butter chicken curry, mild chili pepper curry, and kidney bean curry!"
My son was delighted to receive this as a gift for Christmas.  Awhile back we were given a gift pack of various salts and this flavor was his favorite.  It quickly was consumed and he commented about how much he missed this item.  Now he has a replenished supply.  We paired it with a bamboo salt box for a really unusual gift.
"I bought this on a whim at my natural foods store, but I will be purchasing it here in the future because it is much cheaper online.  I have read all over the internet that this is a great beauty product, and really wonderful for your hair.  I started doing weekly vinegar scalp treatments (50/50 ratio with water) a few weeks ago, and I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair that I'm shedding.  I apply the treatment directly to my scalp using a hair dye application bottle (with a small pointed tip), and then wrap my hair up in a towel for about an hour.  I then wash it out and style normally. I am not sure how it works, but I am now losing about 1/4 of the hair that I used to during my daily washing/styling routine.  I also noticed that my scalp doesn't itch anymore.  It was never a big problem in the past, but it is something that I have noticed :)<br /><br />I also started having acne a few months ago, and I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an antibiotic cream, because he thought it was an allergic reaction to something.  The antibiotic cream didn't clear up the acne.  On a whim (again), I applied a 50/50 ratio of Bragg's vinegar to my face at night on a cotton ball (I take off my makeup with this mixture instead of washing my face; I hate washing my face at night for some reason), and within a week, my acne completely cleared up.  Again, I don't have any idea how this works, but it has worked wonderfully for me.<br /><br />My skin loves this stuff, and I am so happy that I found it.  I am also so thankful that it is nontoxic and it doesn't have a bunch of harmful chemicals in it.  Next to coconut oil, this vinegar is my holy grail beauty product :)"
"Orgain is healthier than most drinks, so it says, and is awesomely delicious! I also find it to be quite filling. Highly recommended!"
"I have a box of frozen Skyline from the grocery, and a pack of this stuff (which is pretty good.)  The manufacturer on the back is listed as ""SkyTime"" at ""4180 Thunderbird Lane, Fairfield, OH 45014"" which is ALSO the address of the real thing, ""Skyline, Inc.""<br /><br />So is this stuff really Skyline?  Why not advertise as such?  Oh well;  it's good and I can make my own low-fat variation my body tolerates."
"I picked up a bag of this at the health food store yesterday. I have given up caffeine due to a mild heart arrhythmia and was actually looking for some high quality decaf. But, it was very expensive and the Teecino was half the price (on sale), so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I am very much enjoying this beverage (with a little milk or almond milk.) I have explored the company website, too, and learned that even decaf coffee may contribute to heart arrhythmia. The health information provided by the company website was convincing and I feel that switching to this will be a healthy change for me. I also found out that they have about 16 flavors, so I have ordered a sampler and looking forward to trying the others. I usually bake biscotti to give to friends for Christmas and I'm thinking of buying a couple more variety sets and including a couple of samples with each gift.<br /><br />I'm glad to see that this product is available through subscribe and save here at Amazon. I do really like the Vanilla Nut, and once I know what other flavors I like best, I'll be ordering here. Oh, and it's ""Made in America"", too..."
I have been using coconut oil for over a year now.  It's used in cooking and after a few weeks I noticed that the arthritis pain in my hands is does not exist unless I don't use for a week.  It is a side benefit of coconut oil.
"I was very excited that 7 years later, they decide to bring ""Delfa Rolls"" or ""Danish Ribbons"" back.  Seeing these reminded me of my childhood, so I bought a case.  It took WAY too long to receive the package.  It came a day after the latest estimation date.  I busted into the box so fast.  Ripped the packaging and dug right in.  As soon at it hit my mouth I knew.  These are NOT the same as they once were.  They taste fine, but they are not the same.  I think licorice laces you get at CVS or RiteAid for $0.99 are closer to the taste of ""Delfa Rolls"" than these are.  I'm very very disappointed!"
"I got these puffs and they are wonderful!  My kids don't even want to eat the other brands of puffs anymore!  My kids love the Sweet Potato Puffs because they are crunchy, sweet and always taste fresh!  I love that you get more puffs in this container than any other brand.  I really love the HappyBaby products and think that they are the best!  Even my four and two year old sons love their products!"
"This tea is the only kind I drink. It has a roasted taste to it reminiscent of coffee, but is very low on caffeine. I had to find a new place to buy this brand of kukicha because it is no longer stocked where I live at a reasonable price, and no other brand I have tried stands up to Eden's."
"I am very leery of ""energy drinks."" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--""Does that stuff really work?"" Me--""Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!"" Them (two weeks later)--""Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!""<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)"
I used these in a candy buffet & they were great! Everyone loved them & they were very affordable. They came in a sealed case and were packaged perfectly.
"The first time I ordered this product, I just let it go and decided it was a fluke when my containers arrived smashed and broken open.  Now it has happened again!!!  On my first shipment, I also had containers that looked ok, but were obviously open/spoiled after tasting (argh!)"
"The first time I had this tea was at Starbucks, the Grove.  I had diarrhea that day, not feeling well, so I ordered this tea.  I was intrigued by the fine packaging and the fresh looking mint leaves in it.  The flavor was soothing, my stomach felt much better after that.  This is how I got to know Harney & Sons... I love their teas but one flavor..."
One of my office's favorites!  Love the flavor of the Gevalia Tassimo coffees. I wish they would  develop more flavors!
"There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment."
"as the rest...  Have been taking the product for over 3 weeks.  Didn't notice any improvement or change in anything, and it tastes AWFUL>"
I received in a timely manner.  The product was great!  Very fresh.  Will buy from again.
"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again."
"Product claims to be ""Extra Hot"".<br />It's not.<br />It's an ok mustard but isn't really interesting and is only mildly hot. Very mild."
"This is a near-perfect mix of nuts. Unfortunately, the one thing is that there are too many almonds. Great snack before or after a long run! Terrific group of protein and fat for a healthy body, too."
"I used to HATE tea.  But Mighty Leaf is the first kind I tried and actually enjoyed (Chamomile Citrus, lightly steeped).  So decided to try a few other flavors, and now the tropical green tea is my favorite.<br /><br />This tropical green tea is very soft-tasting and fruity.  It's also the first tea that my husband actually likes too!  I do believe we've found a winner in our house.<br /><br />Tea lightweights that we are, we get about four cups of tea out of one pouch. I suggest brewing all at once, rather than a cup at a time. If you do it a cup at a time, the first cup will be VERY fruity, and the last one won't have much fruit at all.  We like it better evenly distributed among several cups."
"Although my cholesterol was not high, I have a family history, and do not want to go there.  This product tastes good and lowered my numbers quite well.  As a result I do not have to take any type of prescription medication.  Works for me!"
"I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase."
"Easily the best tasting GLUTEN FREE pasta out there! We have tried them all. No sandy/gritty taste at all. THE gluten free pasta to buy, hands down."
"Saffron is so hard to find at grocery stores because it's too expensive to stock. However, that's misleading because a little Saffron goes an awfully long way. Buying Saffron from Amazon makes perfect sense and McCormick Saffron comes nicely packaged in an airtight container so you know it's fresh. Saffron is truly the King of all Spices."
"The title says it all. Definitely better than diner coffee, but not by much. Will definitely spend a few more bucks next time and upgrade to a better coffee.."
We tried over and over to catch the moles and no luck. So I would not recommend this product for getting the moles out of your yard.
"I got a recipie for Garbonzo Bean Soup from the TV-Cat Cora show.  It is Chicken Broth (4 cans), Garbonzo Beacn (2 cans), one half chopped and sauted onion, one crushed clove of garlic, some rosemary, and a bay leaf.  The other ingrediant was a chopped canned or bottled red roasted pepper (approx. 12 oz).  I use a 12 oz jar of Zergut Mild Ajvar (has peppers and eggplant) and it was out of this world! Not too spicy and my totally American Family loves it.  I also add some macaroni for a hearty meal.  Ralphs in Orange County, CA was carrying this product, but I can't find it any longer.  I will search Trader Joes and Middle Eastern stores, but if you find it - try it!  Not sure if I would like it as a cold spread or dip, but in the soup, it is an easy, fast, and impressive soup or meal!!!  Yummy!!!!"
I'm sure the product is just fine but my dog won't eat it which is funny since he does eat the dry Kibbles 'n Bits.  I guess he doesn't like the texture.  I have friends whose dogs eat this product.
I bought these for my granddaughter and she LOVES them.  And they are SUGAR FREE.  That's even better.  I put them in birthday cards as well!!
"This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  ""jump"" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks,"
"Not caring for regular tea or the caffeine, I drink herbal tea exclusively and am always on the lookout for fun new flavors.  This Blackberry Vanilla sounded delicious,, not a flavor combination I had seen before.  I should also mention that my true test for how well I end up really liking a tea's flavor is whether or not I need sweetener.  If I need it then the flavor is most likely too bitter for me.<br /><br />Out of the box, the tea bags have a bit of a dried flowers smell, not very fruity.  However, when it is brewing the fragrance is delicious!  The berries wake up, and the vanilla too.<br /><br />I tried this tea both hot and iced.  As a hot tea, the flavor was alright, but it was like there were too many herbs and not enough berries.  I did end up needing a bit of sweetener, as I felt the flavor was too earthy.  The vanilla was too subtle to detect.<br /><br />It was when I tried this tea iced that I found I really enjoyed it.  The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.<br /><br />I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.  Also, the bags and string are some sort of plastic-like material, so I cannot put them in my compost bin.<br /><br />As an iced tea, I liked the Blackberry Vanilla.  But the flavor as hot tea and the less-than-desirable packaging keep me from getting excited about it."
"The Fiber One chocolate mocha chewy bars are next to impossible to find anywhere locally, so I had to order them through Amazon.com and I am delighted that my order was received in tact and within a reasonable amount of time.  I am really quite happy to have found these on Amazon.com!"
"I just finished stuffing these casings and they are awesome. I thought that it was one long piece, instead it's a bunch of them. Convenient for me as I am a first time user of this product. just rinse off the salt then run water thru casing and your ready to use. Perfect if you want to make a small batch or two. About 2-3 feet long each. I will buy more."
"I have a very cute 10 lb. Jack Russell/dachshund mix.  She either carries treats off to ""bury"" them somewhere in the house(if they aren't quite to her liking), or eats them right away(if they are good to her!).  These are a little big for her, but she loves them.  Thankfully, it did take her a couple of hours to munch her way through one of these.  There seemed to be no ill after effects.  She is quite young (only  1.5 years) so her teeth are still lovely and very clean.  I hope these ""digestive"" aids will help her teeth, I'd like to keep them that way.  The ""Mini"" might be a bit of a misnomer for those of us with smaller dogs--it isn't huge, but still, a little big of a treat for one day, and it is a little hard to take stuff away after they've started eating them!"
"a decent product at this price level, but will disappoint anyone expecting a flavorful evo, or one which is good for a salad dressing. the good news is it's price, and the fact it has a rich, buttery taste, and appears to have a relatively high burning temp., so it is good for saute'ing."
"We don't have a pod brewer so we put a couple of these in the coffeepot and brewed water thru it. Yum!  Normally I like a strong coffee, and this was milder than my usual, but the flavor was terrific! Very smooth and totally delicious."
"I always put insane amounts of sugar and cream in my tea, but this licorice spice tea has enough sweet that I don't have to add anything at all. Makes it easy being a college student and rushing out the door, i just grab a cup of hot water and throw the bag in. It even gets better as the tea bag stays in the water, which I usually also have a problem with.<br /><br />My boyfriend introduced me to this tea, and I hope you will try it!"
"These are a great meaty snack to keep at your desk.  They've got a great smoky flavor and a velvety texture, and the casing has just the right amount of pop.  They also stay delicious at room temperature for... well for as long as you can resist eating them, which for me is only a few weeks even for the humongo package I always order.<br /><br />If there's any negative at all for this product, it's that you absolutely do not want to keep a bag in your car during the California summer.  That was kind of scary.<br /><br />So keep it indoors, and enjoy!"
I am so glad I found a place to purchase this product.  I really like Ideal.  I use it in my iced tea and it tastes like sugar.  It works really well with hot tea too.
"Tasty but kind of pricey.  I sort of got hooked on these in Germany, and although I can find other Haribo products in stores Color rado can be really hard to find elsewhere."
"She loves them, and she has excellent taste, possibly except for me, but they are darn good.<br />  donr"
I have always loved teas.  I started to drink more green tea lately cause I heard it was good for the body.  This tea is especially good.  The spices with the green tea are amazing.  The hint of orange peel compliments without over powering the flavor.
"This is the cutest make-up traveler!  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is smaller than I expected...so if you have a lot of makeup, I wouldn't suggest this product.  But if you're like me, and just want just the necessities when going on a small trip, it's perfect!  Color is fantastic, shiny and bright!"
"These work really well. I have a problem with pantry moths, and thought I had almost gotten rid of them, but got the traps just in case. When I first opened the shipping box in my kitchen, a small fleet of moths seemingly came out of nowhere and starting swarming the box. So, I'd say that this is pretty potent love stuff for them! The downside of course is having the traps laying around with dead moths (or struggling moribund moths) stuck to them.  And, despite using the traps for 6 months, and putting all newly purchased grains in the freezer for 24 hrs, new moths are stilling appearing now and then, so full eradication remains elusive."
"I brother and I loved these slimjim, and when it was on sale I bought a whole box. But unless you are intending to sell them, don't buy the whole box. You get tired of these very quickly, plus it's unhealthy. We bought the box for 4 months already but we only ate about 10 sticks."
"An outstanding, deep, rich coffee. This is the first coffee I have found that beats my D&D favorite. Once I use up my 4lbs of D&D coffee on hand, this is the only coffee I will buy!!!<br /><br />I do hope they offer it by the pound in future for people like me that have no problem building my own Perfect Pods."
Received product quickly and as promised. Great price considering I am not able to locate this product where we currently live. Would highly recommend.
"Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D"
"Not very good. Powdery tea, little taste, little smell. Doesn't come close when compared to other loose leaf Ceylon brands."
"Dogs love them! They are sticky when handling them though so be prepared to wash your hands, or let your dogs lick them clean!"
This tea is great! It's flavor is not mild like many green teas. I don't even use sweetener because I enjoy the flavor.
"got this, started to grow it.  one of the seeds took forever to really grow at all, then suddenly it grew the tallest, though with the least amount of grass blades.  then suddenly a week later they all stopped drinking water and died."
I love these bars because they are nice and crunchy.  I have had other brands that are made with mostly dates and they just do not have that crunch that I like when eating granola bars.
"This is the best diet ginger ale there is, but your price is too high and the shipping cost more than the soda.  The soda is all real and has zero everything encluding no sodium and only uses sucralose as a sweetner.  I will use nothing else as a sweetner. I can get this at Trader Joes for about $2.99 for 6 cans. although I have to travel about 40 miles round trip to do so.  P.S. Be careful when you first take your first drink because it has real ginger in it and if you inhale it, it will make you sneeze."
This is a healthy low fat snack for dogs and a good value too!
I thought the name was cute and I am trying to buy fair trade organic products so I thought I would give this a try.  The beans barely had a scent when you open the bag and after grinding you just didn't get that fresh ground coffee scent. It just seemed like it wasn't as fresh as it could have been.
"I bought this for my fiance for Valentine's day, and he actually got me the same thing at the store. The ones I ordered taste so much better! Super fresh! Absolutely addicting."
"I love Izze products, but especially the blackberry flavor. They are delivered monthly and I order enough so I never run out. It's a great alternative to colas or other types of sodas.  Healthy juice and just the right amount of carbonation keeps me an Izze fan. The Subscribe and Save program is ideal for me."
"I've only tried these a couple of years ago and don't remember my experience. This semester I have an advanced college class from 5pm to 10pm every Wednesday and it's after a couple hours of work and another class. I usually drink coffee in the morning so I don't want to push it and drink more before a long class late in the day.<br /><br />I ordered the 12 pack of Pomegranate last week and yesterday just before class I drank my 1st bottle. Within two minutes I was actually feeling more alert and energized. I'm a 22 year old guy who's somewhat active but not exactly in shape, and this made me feel like going out and exercising even though I had been rushing around most of the day. I would say the effects lasted past the 5-hour mark as I was still feeling awake and alert around midnight (7 hours after drinking a full bottle). Of course results will vary but mine excellent on the first try. I'll update next week or anytime thereafter if I have any negative or interesting effects.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-10-2011:<br />I held out and didn't try another bottle until my Wednesday class came around again and I had the same effects as last week. I was alert and able to enjoy the class while others were fatigued from the long day. I ended up staying awake until 4am and I'm not sure if that was because of the 5 Hour Energy but I don't usually stay up after 1am if I have work the following day, so beware if you're interested in this for late night applications."
"I am a coffee lover and quite picky about my coffees. Every coffee brand claims hand-picked gourmet coffee, so it is hard to find a good bean. As with many things, coffee is a matter of personal taste. I don't like the bitter flavor of Starbucks, for example, which is the result of their trademark roast. I like flavorful coffe that is not bitter. I loved this coffee from Melitta.<br /><br />It is complex and rich, very european in flavor and not bitter at all. It is surely one of my personal favorites. At any given time I have 6 to 8 coffee varieties at home (both whole beans and ground), yet I find myself choosing this Melitta coffee every time and I am not getting tired of it. You should try it."
The Mahogany has a smooth full bodied character.  I highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste!
"Best honey I have ever tasted.  The only problem I encountered was one bucket was poorly sealed and was leaking. Aside from this, the honey is excellent - so good that I have ordered it under Amazon's Subscribe & Save program."
"I sent this bouquet to a favorite friend following the death of her husband.  She said flowers were beautiful, arrived the day after I ordered them and really lasted.<br />Her niece was a florist and says flowers were as good as any they had sent."
"I've tried both this and the same company's Caffe drink...I preferred this which is less bitter and is smoother.  It did taste good on a warm Indiana day, but I doubt that I'll be a regular consumer, preferring freshy brewed coffee.  It's sure worth a try though."
Nice to give to your family members who are serving in our military.  They can put a few packs in one of many pockets of their BDUs/ABUs etc. and have quick nutrition when they need it.
"I ordered this for my mom, who has Celiac disease. She could not tolerate it, it gave her bad diarrhea, as if it had gluten in it."
After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs.  Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs.  My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers.  I guess we won't be ordering them this way again.  We are both very disappointed.
These tasted disgusting but they were a gag gift for my husband since he loves bacon. He took them to work and they had a great time trying them!
This is my very favorite salt. Some people can't tell the difference between various salts- but I can and this is my very favorite! (I also have tried various other sea salts from around the world!)<br /><br />It's a good deal for sea salt- there is a lot of salt per canister.
"My Chinese Crested absolutely loves this food.  She loved it so much I had to buy the larger box and make it part of her regular diet.  She lights up when she see me reach for the box in the cabinet and sits ever so patiently as I prepare it.  Normally she will not eat all of her kibble, but mix a little of this with it and presto it's all gone!!"
This product is tasty enough and convient but you can brew better coffee a lot cheaper.
I combine this with Libby's Organic Black Beans and Libby's Organic Green Beans mixed with Bob's Red Mill Organic Brown Rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time!
"This is the only store bought cookie I will eat. When it's Kashi, I know its healthy. Love the wholesome goodness of oats with the chocolate chips. This is a staple in my house. Treat yourself."
"Wasa Breads would have my unconditional 5-star rating except for the breakage.  When one expects a surface for spreading toppings, a package with  half whole crackers and half crumbs reduces the satisfaction significantly."
"This is a great meal on the go.  I take these to work and can see them as being excellent for road trips.  Everything in this box was delicious!  I rarely would find myself eating pineapple or cranberries, but in box it was delicious!  Do grab a napkin for the pepperoni."
"It's not often I leave a product review, but I'm very happy with the fresh ground taste of the coffee, and the environmentally friendly packing is a nice bonus.  Shipping was fast and I have a new favorite brand of coffee for my Keurig Brewer."
"The first time I had a cup of this tea was at my accupuncturist's clinic.  I came in from a wet rainy day and she offered me a cup of tea.  She asked what kind, I said, ""you decide.""<br />WOW!  Didn't know they made heaven in a cup!<br />by far my favourite version of earl grey, the lavender is such a nice touch & the other brands that are similar to this one just can't touch it!"
"I supposed as a treat, this would do better than its dog food. But I was wrong when I received and tried it today. My dog does not like it at all. This treat feels like cookies and very dry. I got a small dog (Yorkshire). I don't know if big dog will find it delicious or not. Just my own experience."
"Yum, yum, yum! These candies are so addictive. I have frooties wrappers everywhere! Grape and Watermelon are the best. Be prepared to chew."
"We were delighted to find the Davidson's Teas in bulk.  They are the same quality as stores such as Teavana, which are 5-10x the price per oz.  This bag lasted us approximately 3 months drinking it several times per week.  It is an organic product, which we really liked, and the flavor is fantastic."
"It's hard to find products that are actually good for our dogs & their teeth but these are. What a plus to offer a ""low calorie"" dental bone. Our gal just turned eleven and has arthritis, so we have to really watch her diet since she can't exercise like she use to. She really loves them. I wish they were less expensive also but unfortunately so much of the stuff that is offered out there has some ingredients that are harmful or cause stomach problems."
"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first."
"Twinings Chai Tea is Mediocre compared to your local cafe, book store or StarBucks, or in Asia. Just about all of the FORMER StarBucks Coffee's,<br />and Cappuccino's were near perfect from the Tassimo Bosch machine. StarBucks is no longer available, so I'm currently trying a Keurig.<br />At least I can still use the Milk Creamer.<br /><br />* The Tassimo Creamer is real Milk that has been 'ultra-pasteurized' which gives it a longer shelf life ... this is what the rest of the World offers, just wished that we could get these products in the US, instead of Powdered Milk!<br /><br />* My Rating is like 2.5 to 3.0.<br /><br />* For Chai, I'd rather drive downtown."
"I wrote this to ease the worries of those who read some of the lower starred reviews complaining about the plastic container and possible ""leaching"" of harmful byproducts into the oil.  Turn your Nutiva jar upside down and read inside the little recycle triangle.  See the little ""1"" symbol and the PETE written under it?  That's a good plastic:  ""#1 is Polyethylene Terephthalate, also marked as PET or PETE. Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the ""good"" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses."" [...]<br /><br />Also, don't worry about the clear container--coconut oil is highly resistant to becoming rancid from heat/light, unlike olive, corn, and other oils.<br /><br />Enjoy."
"Low sugar, low fat, a measured amount, and sweet and chocolatey enough to satisfy my evening sweet tooth cravings."
"Sun Maid California Pitted Prunes, 16-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4) These should last you for several months or more. I'm still working on the 1st can and I can say without fear of retribution that these sweet treats will do their intended work overnight or less.<br />I learned how to navigate my power wheel chair at top speed from living room to bathroom, 15 feet plus two turns, and that after transfering from my easy chair; all the while clenching...my teeth."
"This is one of my favorite coffees. I used to buy it ground in bags locally but they stopped carrying it. It's smooth, light and not bitter at all. Beautiful caramel/nutty undertones give it a very nice after taste. I just wish this wasn't as expensive. I've recently been hooked on Tully's Kona Blend because I can get it locally at reasonable prices."
"My son and I have been ordering this stuff for months now, a bag a week. My son is a vegan endurance athlete and needs a lot of protein to fuel his workouts. He adds PB2 to almost every meal. His favorite is oatmeal with PB2 and bananas. Yum! It tastes great and is reasonably priced on Amazon. Since we have Amazon Prime, it's a breeze to just click a couple buttons and sit back to wait for our PB2 delivery in two days. Definitely a product we'll be ordering MUCH more of."
"I usually feed my dogs soft and chewy treats but I wanted to try something new, so I tried this. At first, my dogs smelled it and was curious but after tasting it, they love it!"
"The taste is one of the better tasting Larabars I've had. It has a slight sour taste because of the dried fruit pieces, but it's less noticeable then some of the others. All and all it's pretty good. Definitely filling."
"1st: my cats really don't eat this brand with much relish like they did when Wellness had the mylar bags. We really miss those bags, the food just seemed to taste better to my cats. Canned, they won't touch any flavor but turkey.<br /><br />2nd: I've had 3 out of 12 in a case smell off and even the dogs won't touch it. So just check yours JIK.<br /><br />What has happened to this brand? They were the BEST 2 years ago!"
"When we visit Louisiana we buy this by the dozens. When we don't visit Louisiana, we order it online.<br />This is not like molasses in taste but it is like molasses in use. We use this to make gingerbread and it makes a better gingerbread than using molasses or dark corn syrup. We often use this to put on biscuits instead of using honey. When I make candied pecans I use this syrup. My husband prefers this over maple syrup for his pancakes.<br /><br />It is very thick and the colder it is, the slower it moves. As I said, it doesn't taste like molasses but it does have a bit of the aftertaste the same. It is used in our house interchangably.<br /><br />Enjoy."
"Picked up two bags of these for just over $10, great deal! Taste great, sort of sweet sort of sour, not recommended for the calorie counters though! Since they are so small in such a large back you can find yourself eating way more than you thought you would, If you can, ration them out to yourself and eat them slowly very addicting!"
"I purchased a quart carton of chamomile tea at a street fair about 2 years ago.  I started using it a few months ago and it was excellent, in spite of its age.  It had a great calming effect on me and I went to sleep about 20 minutes after drinking it.  Thinking it was ""cheap"" (after all, I bought it at a street fair), I ordered Two Leaves and a Bud brand from Amazon and it was awful!  I had to use 3-4 tea bags in a single cup  to achieve any degree of strength or taste or desired result.  In my opinion, the packaging is gorgeous; the product leaves a lot to be desired."
"Blue Diamond almonds are by far my favorite for flavor and texture. My only minimal complaint about these is that they are very minimally spicy. I was afraid to go for Habenero in case they were TOO spicy, but given that these are much more mild than Jalepenos I will go for Habanero next order."
I like rockstar or gatoraide for a better choice. Picked some up and can't really force it down. Take a pass on this.
"I am a white, white Maltese. Before Mommy started giving me the Pro-Treat Beef Liver, freeze dried, my tears were black and stained my face. With my enjoying one treat per day, my beautiful white face is so beautiful.  I eat only natural, non colored food and drink spring water. But Mommy says the treats were the icing on the cake. AND, I love them too."
"I am usually not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these literally melt in your mouth. They are so soft and tasty! I would definitely recommend these to someone who loves oatmeal, and even those like me who would probably pick a different flavor over this one."
My husband and I drink it every night before going to bed. It's great in taste and very relaxing after long day... :)
"I love these gluten-free cookies.  I used to buy them at Starbucks, but they are much more affordable through Amazon.  The only issue I have with them is that several cookies in each box are broken.  They obviously taste the same, but I can't use them for guests.  Will definitely buy again and again!"
I am enjoying this product and it tastes great.  I appreciate that it is finely granulated and can be used in a regular salt shaker.  It is pink though and people may not realize that it is salt when they see it in a shaker.  I would definitely buy this again.
"I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again."
This is a perfect replica of the famous Samoa Girl Scout cookies.  And you can't beat the price.  It's hard not to eat the whole box in one sitting!
"These tubs of candy are pretty big and if you hide them in your room they double as a air freshener, cause I can smell them through the box."
"I like drinking something other than sports drinks to get my electrolytes in after a workout, so I don't mind that this is higher in sugar and calories (110, I believe) than the other Zico waters.<br /><br />Even if you don't like the taste of regular coconut water, you should try this! It makes for a great dairy-free milk (in fact, I would compare the taste to chocolate almond milk)."
This is a great drink and is a shame it has been discontinued by Nestles.  I have always enjoyed the taste and it is always refreshing to drink.
"These sugar-free caramels are indeed delicious (and deserve 5 stars for taste), but a price hike at Amazon from $53.42 to $87.00 in a little over 2 months is more than I can stomach.  I'll buy them somewhere else."
"My kitten loves this stuff, she can't get enough and she is a bit on the picky side.  So when they call it Fussie Cat they mean it. I can't get her dish set down fast enough for her, she tries to jump in my arms to eat it before I get a chance to set it down.  I also feed her dry kibble, but supplement with canned food for the added moisture in her diet. Fussie Cat makes for a Happy Cat, also compared to most canned foods (even other good brands) this one actually looks like real fish, whole pieces that you can tell is fish, not something that looks questionable."
"I got a new batch of these tasty sticks and it seems they withered down the skin quite a bit. Even just early this yr, I had to many times spit out the skin because I just couldn't chew it enough to let it go down. I was basically chewing on it enough to get the inner ""meat"" out of the tough casing. Now, I can barely notice the casing and *everything* goes down much easier. I just had 2 sticks and they were yummy!!"
"My little terrier mix is certainly a picky eater - unless we're out on the sidewalk - where there is nothing, NOTHING he won't turn his nose up at!<br /><br />I've discovered he will gobble this up if I mix a handful of this dry mix with a tablespoon of the wet food also by Wellness <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFRYWU"">Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, Turkey and Sweet Potato Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans</a>... and maybe as a special little treat some cooked chicken or ham. It sometimes helps to give it 15 seconds in the microwave to release some of the smells and its seems to stimulate his appetite somewhat.<br /><br />It definitely feels like it's good for his energy and digestion. We were having problems with his previous diet - without being too graphic - to our GREAT relief, he's now never gassy and it's much easier to pick up after he's 'done his business'."
"Really good addition to any picnic. This condiment adds a little zest when added to a hotdog or burger. I mix it generously in cottage cheese to enjoy its dill taste. Too bad its difficult to get at the grocery. Seems like they're hiding it for themselves. 26 oz. bottles are best but only available sporadically.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UC8BC"">Heinz Dill Relish, 12.7- fl. Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>"
"These treats have all that I could ask for. They are small, grease-free, non-crumbly, contain few ingredients, contain an interesting variety of flavors, and are super-appealing to both my dog and cats. These treats hold together better than other freeze-dried treats I've used. The Trail Mix bits are used as high-value rewards for extra good behavior and they're much easier to port around and cleaner than cheese or hot dogs."
"My dogs love these but they make them very gassey.  So if you don't mind clearing the room 20 mins after they eat them, they are great for training because of the small size."
"I have one large mug of lychee tea every morning and I really like this brand.  The aroma is delicate and not overpowering in the morning.  This company's tea is the nicest I have found.  The leaves are also nice and large, not little dust mites!!!  I have been drinking this flavor for several years and truly enjoy it.  Much nicer than other brands I have also tasted/tested :)  Hope you enjoy it as well."
"Being lactose intolerant, I was happy to find a milk-free chocolate bar.  But don't let the milk-less-ness of these bars fool you.  They are out-of-this-world delicious!  There's lots of chocolate both outside and inside.  The calories are reasonable; plus, you get 10 grams of protein."
This product tastes great. I use it in my protien shakes to help mask the tastes of some of the flavors I have tried and do not like. With the PB2 I now like the taste of the shakes and use this every day. I prefer the PB2 with coco powder but both products taste great.
"Got Peanut butter, Costed me 5$ per jar in my grocery store, alot cheaper on here. i recommend this product!!!!!!"
"I don't know why, but lately I've had trouble finding these IAMS dog biscuits in the local grocery stores.  Since my German Shepherd loves them, I searched Amazon and found this Pack of 6 deal.  Rudy is happy.  His teeth are staying clean and all is good!"
"This is a really tasty cracker, not dry like some GF crackers can be. This is a great price at Amazon. I am using some for bread crumbs."
"Since my daughter is 14 months old she pretty much eats what I prepared for meals, however sometimes I don't think what I have made is something she should eat such as steak (too hard to chew).  So I like to have these available for a quick meal to prepare for my daughter.  She likes the taste, simple to prepare, and you have meat and vegetables all in one meal."
"I'd ordered a number of samplers to try different things, and this ended up a mainstay in our house because of its good value."
"This product is fairly expensive, for what you get. It would be fine if you had guests coming and you are not a wheatard, so you need something to feed them.<br /><br />Ingredient list: Brown rice flour, baking powder, vanilla bean powder, salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />Vanilla powder aside, anyone who is GF has these ingredients.<br /><br />I added quite a few things to it to help it out: eggs, olive oil, almond milk, a little sugar (it's not sweet), and a little tapioca flour. I did this because I was having trouble with the waffles I made being soggy. I don't think it would work with out eggs, or egg replacer, as it's just rice flour. You can get rice flour cheaper than this. Save your money."
Why did Snyder's drop this product? Was I the only one who loved this snack? I really hate it when I find something this great and then it gets dropped from production.
"Holy smacks--this stuff is thick! I can't take it, but it's hubby's second favorite behind Santa Buzz. It's not bitter, just very intense."
I received a completely different product than I ordered. The product is similar but is a different brand and does not taste good. I would like the product I bought  please.
Yummy wasabe peas are just hot enough. Only make you eyes water if you eat more than two at a time.
"I can't buy these fresh or dried where I live, so I was glad to find these.  They are great in soups & casseroles.  I've also soaked them in water and used them in omelets.  Going to try them in a salad tonight."
Ok the keurig is a trap because it makes such good coffee and the cups are so expensive.... Black tiger is very good as a dark strong coffee and the price is good if you sign up for monthly shipments...
"I love the variety of choices you get with the Keurig and this is another fine example.  My family tends towards the darker roasts and have settled on a few favorites.  We've been trying to make our way though most of the varieties and Jet Fuel has landed solidly in our top 5.<br /><br />This is a strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  We only use it on the largest cup size setting as it is too strong for smaller cups.  However, being strong should not be equated with tasting like burnt dirt.  There are some great flavors in this cup and a nice long smooth finish.  I love it when a sip of coffee lingers on the tongue for a few moments and makes you want to take another sip.  Jet Fuel meets the bill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o strong dark brew<br />o nice flavors<br />o long smooth finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit too strong for smaller cup sizes<br /><br />Overall - highly recommended - a family favorite."
"Although vanilla coffee is not my favorite, I thought I'd try this as it was the Starbuck's brand.<br /><br />A nice full-bodied cup of coffee with vanilla added.  The aroma and flavor of the vanilla is not strong or overpowering like some brands.  It's quite enjoyable.<br /><br />I made a pot at work and it was well received.<br /><br />If you're a fan of flavored coffees, I recommend you try this.<br /><br />Thank you<br />MEF"
I was going to purchase this until I saw that it has Soy Lecithin in it. Soy is estrogenic and Soy Lecithin in particular is like the crap they scrape off the floor. They pump it into everything and is NOT good for you. Why is it so hard to find food without this crap in it? Especially in food that is supposed to be good for you because it is organic!
"My baby girl absolutely adores Sprout stage 1 and 2 pureed baby foods, so I was really looking forward to giving her Sprout stage 3 foods when she turned 8 months old and was ready for an introduction to textured solids.  The first time we tried this Sprout stage 3 Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese, my little-one gagged so hard that her eyes watered!  (And she also panicked a little ... very scary for Mom & Dad!)  I know that a bit of gagging is to be expected when introducing a baby to textured solids, but this was well beyond the norm.  I then tried some of the Mac & Cheese myself, and while it was certainly flavorful, it contained pretty large chunks of food, like whole pieces of elbow macaroni.  Plus, it was so thick that you could barely stir it with a spoon.  Definitely too much for my baby, who'd only had smooth purees up to that point.  Sprout is definitely the thickest and chunkiest of the organic stage 3 baby foods that I've tried.  The stage 3 training dinners from Plum Organics and Ella's Kitchen are textured, but they contain very small, soft bits of meat, vegetables and rice/pasta that were much easier for my baby to manage (i.e., little or no gagging).<br /><br />Once your baby is comfortable eating chunky textured solids, Sprout stage 3 baby foods are bound to become a favorite.  The Mac & Cheese (and the other flavors) are very tasty and well-seasoned, minus the added salt and sugar, which babies don't need.  And Sprout baby food is certified organic to boot.  Therefore, I'll be storing these stage 3 pouches in the back of my pantry for a few weeks until my baby girl is ready for them.<br /><br />For advanced textured solid-eaters: A<br />For newbies: C"
My 14 year old cat had a bad bout of pancreatitis due to stress from moving. Almost lost him.  But these helped bring his appetite back.  He ate these more than any other food for awhile. Thank you for a good product.
the ones i received from amazon.com were absolutely delicious. i will be buying alot more of these in the near future.
"Our dentist recommended Xylitol suckers or gum for our daughter who gets cavities really easily. We opted for the suckers and we are very happy with them. They could probably be a little more flavorfull, but we love the fact that they are sugar free and feel good about giving them to our children."
"These cookies are by far my favorite!  Nice and crispy (not crunchy), plus a hint of white chocolate & espresso makes for amazing texture and flavor.  Would definitely recommend these to anyone!!"
"This Chai hits the spot perfectly and for a great cost combined with the simplicity of only needing to add water.  Yes, I will admit it is not as smooth as a Starbucks Chai Latte if you just make it like I do with nothing but hot water and no frother, etc.  However, for how easy it is to make, how cheap it is overall, and how quickly Amazon gets this to me, I will take this any day of the week.  I have saved soooo much money already from drinking this instead of my daily habit of visiting Starbucks previously.<br /><br />For those wary of buying in bulk like this, it is well worth it, and trust me you will drink it.  I have gone through 4 cans already and am about to order my next 2 cans.  I keep one at home, and one at work.  Never know when you need that Chai fix ;).  The flavor is perfect for me; it has the right amount of spices and a pretty creamy taste for being a powder mix (much better than most hot chocolate/etc mixes in terms of smoothness).  I am tempted to try the other varieties that Big Train sells as well now... like Vanilla.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this product, and will continue to order it as long as they sell it.  5 Stars, 2 Thumbs Up!"
"I was unimpressed. These treats are expensive and super gooey messy. Once out of the ball, this expensive treat can be devoured in seconds. I have a rottie and bullmastiff, of course if you have a smaller dog you may not have the same results. See my review regarding the treat ball."
"Bob's Red Mill is my absolute favorite brand of nutritional yeast. I've even been to the factory outlet in Oregon! Some nutritional yeast is small flake and doesn't have the same texture as the large flake version. Some is light colored and appears like it's lost its nutrients and flavor.<br /><br />I use nutritional yeast on virtually everything, and we even have a little shaker of it on the dinner table. It's amazing on popcorn with a little salt and dill, I love it in pestos instead of cheese, it flavors up any vegan cheeses you are making (great for vegan macaroni-n-cheese), and works well in soups and stews.<br /><br />The best part is that it's actually nutritious. If you're a vegan, it gives you a boost of vitamin b12 so you don't have to take a vitamin supplement.<br /><br />I order from Amazon and use subscribe and save, which is the best deal available for it."
"For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little ""bumps"" on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further, the quality of the ceramic glaze is terrible.  There are several spots on my piece where the glaze was missed and the raw porcelain shows through.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, the water drips though WAY too fast.  When i make a single cup the water is fully through the cone in less than 30 seconds.  This is far too fast given that coffee should ideally steep in the water for 1.5 to 2 minutes.<br /><br />The handles are also thin and flimsy.  They look like they would easily snap off.  Lastly, this item is made in China so I'm concerned about the lead content of the glaze used.  Given the shoddy overall quality I would not be surprised if they were also careless about what went into the glaze materials.  Do yourself a favor and find something made in Japan."
I was worried about using things like this from online but it was a great buy and all worked out.  Thank you
"My cats enjoy the taste of this, it seems to be healthy for them also. My orange tabby has hairball problems, hopefully the moisture will help him out here. The bag is heavy duty, re-sealable, and easy to store. I would definitely get this again, maybe in another flavor just for variety."
This is a fantastic product.  This makes a very refreshing drink and it's good for you! How nice that Amazon offers continuing orders.  Saves gas (traveling to store) and time.  Plus you always know when it will arrive.
"This product is absolutely essential to making the best Lobster Stew ever.  If you are making it without you are missing out on that wonderful lobster flavor that will take it from delicious to orgasmic! I have a recipe that I created myself and this base is the finishing touch to what I consider to be my cure for whatever ails me. It only takes ten minutes to put together and then another 20 to ""gel"".....mmmmmm....instant heaven.  And this lobster base it what makes it possible."
"I found this works best if you take it first thing in the morning before eating or having coffee.<br />In about an hour you feel an energy surge that lasts about 4 hours. At first I was taking it after breakfast, coffee, etc and didn't notice a difference, but on an empty stomach it's a lift off."
"Since I spend most of my week alone, opening a big box of cereal is such a waste.  The cereal would always go bad before I could eat it all.  This doesn't happen with these containers.<br /><br />I love these individual serving sizes because they also aid in calorie counting and at 80-110 calories, they are low in calories.  I carry around one of the fruit loops packages in my backpack, just as a great snack.<br /><br />I do want to warn though, that Amazon shipped them to me in a single box and about 20 of the containers arrived opened inside the box because the outer box was a little damaged, but being the great company they are, Amazon promptly shipped another box ""free of charge"" and allowed me to keep the ones from the original shipment that made it here okay.  I love Amazon!"
"Of course no bagged tea can ever be the ""best tea ever"", but in the realm of bagged, this tea is about the best you could ever ask for.<br /><br />Twinings Everyday is just that- a tea that's perfect every day of the week. It's a light black tea, with a nice easy flavor that has just a pinch of citrus. Steep it more lightly and you get an almost white tea flavor, longer to go darker. The only reason any tea enthusiast should be disappointed is if they prefer especially strong brews. My father-in-law is the type that would eat the leaves if he could, so he'd have to use extra bags to make the sort of insanely strong brew he prefers. Then again, that's why it comes in boxes of eighty.<br /><br />The actual flavor is perfectly balanced, and suits whatever bells and whistles you want to tack on. If you want to drink it as is, it's wonderful. It goes perfect with lemon, or with milk, and I've found it's also wonderful with honey and sugar. In short, this tea suits whatever you're in the mood for.<br /><br />I recommend this tea enthusiastically. I wound up picking up a box on clearance, and couldn't be happier. If you love tea, this is the perfect default to keep at hand when you can't decide which specialty brew to have. If you've never really gotten into tea, this is the pefect blend to learn what the fuss is about. This tea does lend itself more to afternoon and blending with milk or sweeteners, but it's fine in any situation."
"This tastes fantastic. My only complaint is the heat, it is not quite as hot as I was hoping, but I'm sure the majority of people will find it just right."
"There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled ""Core,"" is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water (""no more than 78%"" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!"
"Never thought that I was able to buy Korean Ramen from Amazon. You can find these at the local Korean market, but the price is much more. Amazon packed the bowl noodles securely and safely and delivered very fast. These noodles turned to my kids' favorite snack. I will definitely buy again."
I've tried many but this is a great tasting coconut water with just a hint of mango.  Refreshing!
"This is a tasty product, however, it's got a tad too much sugar (and consequently calories) for my taste.  If I'm trying to eat healthy, I really do try to avoid eating things with a lot of added sugar.  Now, if I'm going to have a chocolate chip cookie, so be it.  I expect the sugar and carbs.  But, if I'm aiming to eat some granola, then I might just prefer it to be high in fiber, some added protein and a minimal amount of added sugar or otherwise useless carbs.<br /><br />The taste was good...don't get me wrong.  But, don't think this is some health food sorta thing cause it's not really that!"
"I've ordered a number of different kinds of ""Kind"" bars and ""Kind Plus"" bars before.<br /><br />These Cranberry Almond + Antioxidents Kind Plus bars are, by far, the most sticky I have ever had!  The wrapping sticks to the product, the product sticks to your fingers, and pretty soon, you're a bit messy.  You really need a wet-wipe for this product.<br /><br />The product itself is quite delicious, however, so just know that while it's yummy and crunchy and chewy, you'd do yourself a favor by knowing about the stickiness ahead of time.  Oh, and don't get it in your hair or in your child's hair by accident!"
"So nice, after buying one i decided i needed 2 more! Sorry this review isn't very technical, but the method is so easy it does not really need a long-winded explanation."
Signed up for a subscribe and save offer for these and was impressed by the texture and flavor.  Not too sweet nor bland.  They are chewy and won't break your teeth when biting into them like  some bars.
"Cheaper than buying in a store(if you could find it in the store), comes right to your door,and free shipping!!What better way to shop! Don't buy from other online sites, Amazon is the best!"
The best soy sauce I've ever had. It's light colored and light tasting. The heavy standard soy sauces cannot compete with this delightful and flavorful sauce.
"This is great dog food. My golden loves it, her coat is shiny and soft, she has lots of energy and is happy happy happy!"
"We have had our youngest Pug on Earthborn since we got him (10 weeks.) We recently switched him to this to get him off the puppy food (which we recommend as well). We've always been very happy with Earthborn products. Our Pugs coats are so soft and I know it's because of this food. Our older Pug before was on a different brand and we recently put him on this now too and his coat transformed! :) The only reason I give this food 4 stars is because it gives our dogs HORRIBLE gas. Pugs are gaseous anyways, but this makes it sometimes seems lethal. We may be switching to another flavor of Earthborn because of this, but either way we are sticking with Earthborn!<br /><br />*update* after a couple weeks of daily stink episodes with the Pugs they have calmed down a lot and I feel as if the food is no longer effecting them in that way :) We did give them half their old food/half new food for most of that time so maybe that played a role too, so in other words... Earthborn is the best! I feel confident they are getting what they need in high quality and it shows!"
"Vegan or not, teriyaki primal strips are utterly delicious.  I cannot get enough of them.  The flavor is unimaginable.  The texture is incredible.  Everyone I have given samples to has been amazed.  They are expensive, as far as that goes.  But you cannot go wrong on flavor and texture.  These are so darn great that I have't tried any of the other flavors or textures so far."
I purchased this flower to try and to see if there was a big difference in the Caputo flour for pizza.....there is a huge difference in taste and form ability.  It is worth the money!!
This package was great.  My family are huge tea drinkers.  This gives an assortment of teas all of them are full of taste
"My husband I both like this coffee.  I use a 3 oz. cup with milk to make a latte.  He makes a 6-8 oz. cup and uses it with half and half. Strong flavor, not bitter. Not as ""caramelly"" as some we have had, but very good."
"I have many ""pantry moths"". This safer brand product does not attract any of them. I am very upset because the other safer products that I have used are outstanding... this one is a let down..."
"These are a fabulous treat.  I've been on a yeast-free, very low-sugar diet to get rid of a systemic yeast problem.  This is my favorite quick snack that I can eat.  They are delicious, nice and crunchy, and a good source of protein.  My kids love them but I try to keep them for myself.  I highly recommend them!"
"Disappointed in these on flavor or make that lack of flavor.  They taste like a cereal bar to me.  Nice and soft, just not much taste.  I think you would be better off with the lower cost oatmeal cookies at the bakery.  The only advantage to these is the convenience of individual wrapping, but that is what plastic baggies are for.  Sorry, these strike out as being tasty.  There are better cookies at your store bakery department."
These are our favorite chips.  We get very excited when we order the next box and enjoy the fresh and healthy taste.
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKADSS"">Newman's Own® Organics Adult Cat Formula, 76-Ounce Bag</a>  After trying several good quality cat foods, this is the only one that my two cats will eat.<br />They will paw around anything else- as if to cover it up.  Have noticed they maintain good body weight, good appetites, and their fur is healthier and softer. Also notice a difference in stronger eye color. (one cat is Himalayan, and her eyes are getting better color- even tho she is 10 yrs. old)  Am also adding Tiki Cat salmon or chicken, once<br />a day, in separate dish.  This can be found on the internet.<br /> No vomiting, no hairballs, no foul smelling litter boxes."
I use the coconut oil with shea butter to make my own lotion and lip balms. That way I know that no nasty chemicals have been added. The Coconut Oil/Shea Butter potions are very soothing and have actually cured my formerly perpetually chapped lips and dry hands. Wouldn't be without them now!
only product that I know that I can safely give my dogs - they love them and they are recommended by my vet.
"Woo hoo! I just signed up for the subscribe and save and I am getting these for $.91 each! I bought a couple different kinds yesterday for my son to try (he just turned 2) and he inhaled it! GREAT way to up the veggie intake plus fruit and grain! And it isn't messy. And its portable. I paid 1.55 each for these at the local store. I can get them here for 42% off! Happy Baby, happy mommy."
"I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own ""canned/wet"" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh. I would recommend these to anyone who cares about what they feed their dogs."
"These protein chips definately weren't that great.  I can't say they were awful but they have a really grainy dry kinda taste.  I think they would be good with dips, but I have only eaten them plain.  I ordered the 12 pack and still have 11 boxes left lol.  I would recommend sampling them somehow, try 1 box if you can, instead of 12!"
I love these things they have a perfect flavor. I wish I could just eat these and eat em all day long!!!!!!!!!!
"A cool movie with some very funny and amusing moments, a young alec baldwin & gena davis & winona? ryder...micheal keaton is a great ghoulish pervert!! worth seeing for micheal keaton.. BluRay is nothing stunning but good textures and clarity, better than dvd but not the greatest looking bluray disc, outside shots are great, indoors nothing stunning. grew up watching this as a child in the 80's, stills holds up alright if just a little too short.... last joke of the movie with beetlejuice in the waiting room sitting next to the african tribesman is a big laugh!!!! see it if you never before, guaranteed to make you smile.."
This is a favorite of Boxer and Rottie.  It has a pleasant aroma and is soft.  On long walks it is great when I need a rest.  I intend to buy it again.  Mixed with dry Iams it adds a flavorable extra.
"The product arrived in a timely manner. It has a nice flip open cap with a squeeze nozzle type deal similar to mustard or ketchup. The oil is a rich green color. I've used the oil on pasta (it has directions to make a salad dressing on the bottle) and I like the flavor a lot. The flavor is kind of a warm, rich, nutty kind of flavor. What I bought the product for was not for food though. I bought it for my read dry skin on my face. I got really bad sunburn last summer on my face and it's been flaking ever since on my cheeks. So, I squirt a little bit on a sock and rub my face with it! The flakes of skin come right off and it helps my skin. It hasn't given me acne and this oil miraculously does NOT clog pores. I shaved my head and gave myself a mohawk but I noticed I had really bad dry scalp on the sides and it was disgusting. I treated my head with this stuff for about a week and now it doesn't have any flakes and is completely healed... my face is being stubborn though... the sun really cooked it last summer. If you're looking for a healthy product for your face and your food then buy this stuff... it's great!"
"I've had a few other instant fried noodles meals here and there but these, unlike others, really taste like real fried noodles!  Very stout flavor, perfectly done noodles, perfect spicing, and a really good lunch!  Add a diced hamburger patty and a dash or two of pepper sauce and serve it on warm tortilla chips and it's a real meal!  This one is GOOD!  Thank you Maruchan and thank you Amazon!"
IMHO this has just the right amount of cinnamon flavor and sweetness. I really like it.  Glad I can't find it locally because I would be an addict.  I have more self-control ordering off the Internet.  :^D
"The Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Diet mix is the best low calorie dessert I've found!  It's better than a chocolate bar, as it tastes as good and has only 25 calories, and cascium and Vitamin D.  What a great way to end a meal!  Highly recommended!"
Bought the bottles less than a month ago.  Totally Tasteless...odorless...useless.  First time I used it and found it a waste of time in my coconut cream pie.  For crying out loud...it doesn't even SMELL like coconut.  Sorry I purchased it.
"Despite the name, it's great for those who require a bit more heat from their every day hot sauce.  I believe it's rated at 3-4 times the scoville level of Tabasco, so nice heat while maintaining flavor."
"We have used Lipton tea bags for our tea just about as long as we've been married and that's a really long time!<br /><br />I discussed with my wife a reviewers comment about the strength of the tea and she said she had not noticed any change in tea strength. I'll admit we may let our tea steep a little longer than average but we've always done that and haven't noticed any changes in the tea.<br /><br />When we make ice tea, which is often seeing as how we live in the South, we use Lipton's Ice Tea blend in the larger bags instead of the smaller bags used here. My wife likes to compensate in advance for ice melting so she does make it strong.<br /><br />We have one opened box in our pantry and one unopened box in reserve. In addition to the regular black tea we also use Lipton's Green Tea and the Orange Spice for variety.<br /><br />All told we are happy with the Lipton products and have no plans to change."
"I like these crackers. They are crispy all grain, with more of a corn chip flavor with a mostly salty taste (to me, anyways). To me, they taste like Fritos, without the artificial colors. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."
"Very fruity and tasty - my personal favorite acai tea. Expensive as all Teavana teas are, but well worth it."
"After I tried this type of tea I quickly became an addict.  However, it seems that everyone either loves it or hates it.  You probably shouldn't buy six boxes before you are sure someone in your household loves it."
"I think Snapple makes great products. I especially like their ice tea and used to drink a lot of the regular, full sugar variety until I decided to do something about my weight. (The card from the scale at the drug store said, ""beware of ivory poachers"". - I got my shoes shined, I had to take the guy's word for it.)<br /><br />The lemon flavor seems to hide the artificial sweetner taste and I have been drinking it for a few months without really missing the one with real sugar.<br /><br />The 16 oz. size works perfectly for me - a 12 oz. can of soda isn't enough but 2 cans, is a little too much.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good summer drink. I especially like the trivia tidbits written in the cap...<br /><br />Give it a try if you want to cut back on calories and not suffer from the experience."
"This tea is quite tasty.  I can't vouch for the ""energy"" side of things as I'm constantly drinking all kinds of tea.  The citris gives it a little sweetness.  I prefer my tea a little more bitter, but people who don't like bitter tea will love it."
"These chocolates are the BEST!  I was introduced to them in Belgium and while they are not the hottest name, they are the best chocolate.  Amazon's delivery was extra quick, which is good since they are perishable (not that I have ever had one go bad, they don't last that long around my house.)"
"Thank yo Go Picnic for trying to meet the needs of food allergic kids and adults.  I would like to see more dairy free options though.  I wouldn't recommend the salmon as too many kids with food allergies also have issues with fish like salmon.  Although my son can tolerate tuna, he cannot have the tuna meal due to a dairy allergy.  I'd love to help GoPicnic create more allergy friendly options."
This is one of several Bob's Red Mill (gluten free) products I use.  My family loves this cornbread.  As with so many GF products there is a bit of bitter aftertaste.  Add 1/4 cup sugar - no more bitter aftertaste!
"I was impressed with this cider. Originally skeptical of apple cider in a k cup, this really doesn't disappoint. It's nice that the ingredients are natural. It tastes like a great apple cider you'd get from your local farm. Pours cloudy, not clear. Watch the price here though. I usually take a 20% off coupon into bed bath and beyond for my k cups. Comes out to about 8 bucks for 16 I believe."
"When the product arrived, two of the three bags had holes in them, so much farro had spilled out. We have ordered this product once before without such a problem."
"My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!"
"My dogs have been raised on Blue. It is all I will feed them because of quality, ingredients, method of cooking (cold-formed bits), and smell/flavor.<br />I do keep it in an airtight container so it stays fresh longer but I recommend you buy the size that will last a month or so. After a month of being open, it loses it's 'oomph'. The food is still good, but it won't smell as strongly (I'm not sure how smell and flavor diminish but I know every time we open a new bag my dogs act very happy and jump around)<br /><br />I have two doxies, one is 10 lbs and one is 8 lbs. This bag lasts me a month and I feed them each 3 oz. a day."
I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.
"This is marketed the same way that toothpaste is (""doctor recommended""), which for me, has the opposite effect on credibility. Strangely, this product does not have the usual FDA disclaimer that I've seen on other products (""This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA"").<br /><br />Evaluating this water just as a water, apart from the numerous health benefit claims, it's good. When at room temperature, the taste is a bit strange and off-putting. When refrigerated and served cold, it is very refreshing and clean tasting. Not sure what ""Best available pH at 9.5"" means.. This statement does not make sense. pH is a measurement of acidity or alkalinity, on a scale of 0-14 (0 being a strong acid, 14 being a strong base). Normal water is neutral at 7. ""Hydrates better"" than what? What are we comparing this to? Hydrates better than an English muffin? Yes, it certainly does!<br /><br />Most of the other sales bullet points are standard and hardly worth mentioning.. Plastic is type 1 PETE and can be easily recycled, but most beverage bottles are made of #1 or #2. I'm not a fan of bottling water and the claims of reducing carbon footprint are bogus. These bottles have to be shipped across the country, using trucks and airplanes, which is not carbon neutral. It is far more environmentally friendly to get a filter/treatment system and drink your local water supply."
"My puppy's name is Gus. He is a long haired chihuahua and loves these chew sticks. We get the smaller ones and he spends hours every day chewing and tossing them around so he can eventually eat the treat inside. The outer shell is totally digestible as well. This products has never upset his stomach in any way. I consider them cheap and he loves them. He really loves them and they are his favorite. Thanks Canyon Creek, Gus' Mom"
"I just ordered another 50 packets - this stuff is one of the best inventions out there! I stayed away from the Via when it first came out because I'd never had an instant coffee that wasnt nasty. But when Starbucks ran a big promotion I decided to give it a try and I'm SO glad I did. This stuff tastes to me every bit as good as a regular cup of coffee but it's WAY less expensive and super convenient. Instead of messing with coffee pots, old coffee that's been sitting for who knows how long and the like, I keep packets of this on hand at home and work and always have a fresh cup of delicious coffee at a moment's notice. It eliminates the waste of partially used pots, too.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this product and I recommend it to everyone!"
this jerkey is possibly the worst i have ever eaten....the texture is very thready and dry...I tried giving some to my dog and he wouldn't even eat it!
It is not obvious from the product description but these are NOT single serve ESE-type espresso pods.  They do not fit in our Krups espresso machine at all.
"I take this in the evening to help wind down, but feel its effects more in the morning when I ease into the cringing porcelain throne. I appreciate its nutritional value but would like to feel a bit more of the calm and a bit less of the avalanche."
"I did place an order with Amazon for this particular item, but it was canceled because the supplier at the time was not able to provide it (it was not PetFoodDirect - I have had excellent service from them through Amazon).  I managed to order the 4Eva through another source, and the kitties like it.  It was something I wanted because the majority of BFF (and Soulistic, made by the same company) are tuna based (other fish added too, but mostly tuna and fish).  Once in a while it would be nice to have something else;  we get tired of the same thing every meal too!  In general the BFF foods are a good choice - better quality, not outrageous prices."
"I am a regular subscriber of this ""Jack Link's"" beef jerky terriyaki. This morning, I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10. I used to trust Amazon and this is the first time that I check the quantity in the box. Since the inside box is open, so someone might have taken one during the packing process because s/he loves it so much but I hate to lose one bag of my Jack Links beef jerky!!"
"Not a bad cup of Joe. Smooth, medium roast flavor and smells divine and I preferred it to Starbucks. (I do not like the taste of burnt beans.) Only one little problem, I did a taste test with this up against Kroeger store brand coffee a generic.<br /><br />This was almost a dead tie. the flavor and density was comparable with the only obvious difference being that the finer ground of the Melitta meant that it was less acidic and didn't upset my stomach as much after my 4th cup. Unfortunately the disparity in price can be depressing and makes the Kroeger brand appear more reasonable to my budget.<br /><br />Too bad, I do like this coffee."
"Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea is a very delicious and great tasting drink.  Aloe Vera did you say?  Yes, not only is Aloe Vera good for your skin but it's also good for your insides.  If there ever was a wonder plant with so many uses, it has to be aloe vera.  I have tasted a lot of aloe vera drinks over the years and I have to say that this is one of the best.  The mixture of passion fruit , aloe vera and green tea make this one a highly recommended beverage.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a healthy drink that is not only good for you but great tasting then you will want to try Chantea Aloe Vera Green Tea (flavored with Passion Fruit) today!"
This is a wonderful product by Bigelow.  It helps to keep your bones strong.  Our whole family drinks this daily.  Thank you Amazon.com for carrying it.
"My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These ""gourmet"" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!"
I beleive this product may becoming discontnued and it is the only dog food my finicky bassett hounmd will eat.<br />Love the proce and my dog loves the taste. WE are both happy
Bought these for my mother online because she can no longer find this particular Murray cookie at the local stores. She likes these and the shortbread cookies. They have a nice flavor for sugar-free and I recommend them to anyone on a low sugar diet.
"I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one."
"I have tried many protien drinks, and there are loads that I like - the taste, texture and mixability.  This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results. Sorry to sound so negative, but I did felt the need to share my experience - as it differs so much from the norm!"
"Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as ""mild"" on Amazon. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above.<br /><br />A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Amazon, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Amazon just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS. When this coffee arrived, the K-Cups were in a thin Timothy's cardboard box, which Amazon had put inside one of their standard corrugated cardboard boxes. The upshot is that these Timothy's 50 packs are mailed double-boxed, unlike the Coffee People 50 packs, and so it seems less likely that the Timothy's 50 packs will get damaged in the mail."
"Excellent taste and texture!  Since it is par baked (you need to bake for 5 minutes before serving), this GF bread is fresh and wonderful.  I use it like French bread and also for sub sandwiches.  I highly recommend it!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IISX6"">Schar, Baguettes, Parbaked, 12.30 OZ (Pack of 6)</a>"
Excellent product to use in tea and coffee.  It is nice and smooth and enjoyable.
"Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages."
"WAS VERY WELL PLEASE WITH MY CHERRY SPICE I HAVE NEVER TRY THIS TYPE OF SPICES, I WILL KEEP SOME ON HAND ALL THE TIME.,ALSO VERY QUICK SERVICE."
These were the best brownies that I've ever eaten. Very moist and the multiple flavors will delight your taste buds.
It's hard to say if this product has had any kind of calming affect.<br /><br />It's not hard to say if this product affects your bathroom experience.  It does!  Be careful how much you take.
"These are hearty tasting pretzels made with Spelt flour.  They have just the right amount of salt.  Even my husband won't eat regular pretzels anymore when I have these in the house.  The bonus is that nutritionally speaking, these are a healthier choice than white flour pretzels.  The only drawback is that a 7 oz bag gets eaten pretty quickly in my home!"
"WONDERFUL TEA!  Much better than their tea bags.  This is a MUST HAVE in our home as we both enjoy a cuppa to start and end most days.  We were using the actual tea bags for years.  We didn't think that we'd change as it was so inexpensive as we each reused a tea bag for our days cuppa.  While using the K-cups is not as cost effective, IT CERTAINLY DOES MAKE EACH CUP A PERFECT EXPERIENCE!!!!"
These pretzels are just the best! The whole grain gives them a richer flavor than regualar pretzels and the slightly thicker stick is just the ticket for a crunchier/chewier more full flavor treat. I buy them by the case!
We have three darling Shitzus.  All of them adore Booda Bones and look forward to this wonderful treat.  Thank you Amazon!!
"Same principle as a juice box, so just imagine what your children are gonna want to do with these...no straw, but the spout is quite conducive to squishing the apple out everywhere....a kid could almost (and perhaps would rather) play or paint with a ""tube"" of this stuff versus eating it...afterall playing with food like applesauce is much more fun than actually consuming it, and these pouches make it ever so tempting...keep in mind too that the lid is technically a choking hazard for little ones, so unless your say 6 year and up child really wants to consume his/her food from a squeezable tube that seems intended for younger kids, I'm not sure how effective this product is. The applesauce tastes fine, standard low sugar applesauce, but for the high cost, both on amazon and in your local store, as compared to the price of a standard jar or even cups, this seems kind of crazy! I mean, unless your child really, really needs portable applesauce, I'd say stick w/a jar or cups for sooooo much less money, I don't really think this is the best product, and yet another thing to throw in a landfill! Not recommended!"
I was so excited to brew my first cup of apple cider and so disappointed when I found out it was sugar free.  My husband and I both hate the aftertaste of artificial sweeteners and I refuse to give them to my children.  The advertisement should include this information in the listing.
"Purchased while on an extended trip. Despite the nice container, I found this low cost Pu-erh-like tea unfortunately had minimal pu-erh taste and aroma compared to the Pu-erh tea purchased from my Whole Food store at home. I'll try a more expensive Amazon offering next."
"I rescued two puppies with a slew of health problems (mange, allergies, etc. etc.) Neither the vet nor myself could figure out why they were sick until we realized that it could be their food.  I was feeding them what I thought was high quality (Nutro), but it was tearing up their stomachs.  A fellow dog lover recommended Natural Balance and they've been on it ever since.  Two years with nearly no vomiting or soft stools.  I am very thankful for Natural Balance and recommend it to anyone who owns pets with allergies or stomach sensitivity.  Or anyone just looking for a healthy alternative at a great price."
this is a healthy oil that can be used for dry skin.  Don't have dry skin?  Use it as a delicious oil for cooking your favorite frid foods.
"These k-cups taste good and are great for a quick Chai fix. They're also a good coffee alternative, but they not good enough to replace my Starbucks stop for a Chai latte or an Apple Chai."
This was the best stuff for my first trimester!  Even my husband enjoyed nibbling on it. Not too sweet and full of ginger flavor.
"Aromatic and very flavorful with a slight hint of lemon (from lemon grass and lemon balm), this is a great green tea."
"These cookies are so crunchy and full of mini cholate chips.  It is hard to only eat one serving.  They do not 'taste' gluten free, they taste like regular chocolate chip cookies!"
"This is an item I just cant find at the local supermarket.  Decided to buy online and was pleasantly surprised. I think it is a little too expensive for the quantity (14oz does not go very far for the Thai dishes that I make), but the quality of the product was very good and I have now purchased this a couple of times through Amazon."
"Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like."
We have been buying Cafe La Llave Espresso in a 12 oz can at Walmart and have been perfectly happy with this coffee. It intrigues us that this Cuban coffee can be purchased in the US with a trade embargo in place. Or has that been lifted??
"I don't think I've had steel cut oats that I could describe as ""bad"", but I have to say that these don't quite rise to the level of McCann's.  The Arrowhead product is lots, cheaper, however, so overall it might be a better bet unless you want the absolute best.<br /><br />The differences are subtle.  For some reason I get a larger volume of cooked outs from 1 cup of McCann's than I do from Arrowhead, and the McCann's has a more of the distinctive ""nutty"" flavor that makes steel cut oats so delicious.<br /><br />The two products actually have different cooking instructions.  McCann's calls for 30 minutes of cooking once the oats are put into boiling water.  Arrowhead calls for 12 minutes of cooking after the oats are put into cold water and brought to a boil.  Cooked that way the Arrowhead oats are markedly inferior, but cooked the McCann's way they get much better.<br /><br />I'm still on a quest to find oats as good as I had in England at a couple of fancy places in London.  Any ideas?"
"I've been using this for years.  It doesn't require cooking; all you do is pour hot water on it and voila!  It's great for tacos, nachos, or any other Mexican food.  Couldn't be easier and tastes great!  It's also a cheap source of protein when combined with corn."
"A quality product with a fun, interesting flavor. I'm fond of both blackberries and vanilla, and found that both flavors stood out in this tea. The only drawback was that it was very sweet, and my taste buds were a little put off. If you're into teas with a strong, fruity flavor, then this would be worth a try."
"This product is misleading. It says ""Pure Cinnamon"" yet it is artificial... If it were truly PURE it would be 100% natural. Make sure that you know the facts before ordering this product, call and ask for an MSDS or ingredient statement."
Gloria Jeans has a great product of Hazelnut flavored coffee.  The product is liked by all my colleagues.  The transaction via Amazon was prompt and efficient.  Will buy again from Amazon.
"I bought the Almond & Walnut & Macadamia + Protein [12 pack], not the ""item being reviewed"" Fruit & Nut [18 pack]. I purchased these at the $1.10 price per bar that I used to pay ten years ago at Walmart; which is a good deal when you like quality nut bars, and can't find them for under $2.50-$3.00 @ Starbucks. I carry my own bar now to enjoy with their expensive coffee~~~"
What is wrong with this stuff?  It is only good for like one day and then it tastes rotten!  Don't buy it- you'll regret it.
I LOVE this coffee.  It's strong and bold without a bitter aftertaste.  I have just placed an order for another one.
This is a really nummy and nutty bar with chocolate goodness.  The best granola bar that I have had and nowhere near the fat/sugar of a candy bar.  Nuff said...
"I find that this licorice, is one of the most delicious that I have had in many years.  The only thing that ever came close to this when I remember buying it back in the 1950s which was produced by a different company.  The only drawback that I see is that I think it's quite expensive.  As I figured each 16 ounce bag comes to about $10.50 each I myself purchased four of those bags.  And of course let's not forget the shipping that is not included.  I think in the future I'm going to look for a company that sells in larger quantities, because sometimes it's cheaper to buy in bulk as opposed to little individual bags, and also many times shipping is included."
"We use a lot of dill seed at our home, so finding it in bulk was a Godsend. The seed is vacuum sealed in a sturdy bag which we keep tightly clasped shut until we need to refill the bottle we keep in the kitchen. Fresh, pungent, and wonderful describes this dill seed very well. Thank you to the seller for having it on Amazon!"
"I gave my wife a Keurig last Christmas but, being a coffee purist, scorned using it. Then one morning I was running later than normal so I borrowed one of her K-cups and had a cup. Not bad but not my cuppa. I was intrigued and shopped around trying different coffees until I hit on the Jet Fuel. Strange name notwithstanding, an excellent cup of coffee. I do occasionally miss grinding and brewing, but this is sooooooo convenient and the coffee isn't bad."
"If you like the savory taste of beef hearts, you won't be disappointed by this product. Delicious beef heart flavor in every bite."
Great flavor.  I snack on these when I need a boost of energy.  They help satisfy cravings between meals.
"My dogs have always been fond of pigs' ears, but they go crazy over these!  The price is competitive (if you can wrangle free shipping) and the quality is excellent.  I have ordered several times with no complaints.<br /><br />I highly recommend!<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
"This is a great product that not only works to whiten teeth and freshen my dog's breath, but she actually begs for them!!  And it's natural and good for her. These are hard to find at the pet store as they have discontinued them, and I have been searching for them for some time.  THAT'S how much my dog loves them, and THAT'S how great they work!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM"
"Arctic Zero definately satisfies your craving for ice cream but it does lack flavor.  Although you can taste what the flavor is supposed to be, i think it should be a little more intense."
I have tried many different coconut water brands and flavors. This one does not have great flavor compared to other brands. I would not recommend this product...very bland. I should have listened to past reviews.
"These are my dogs' favorite treats.  They love salmon and they love these salmon treats.  I'm happy to give my dogs these treats which are all natural, safe and healthy.  Also, they break easily into small pieces so they are good for training.  I don't know why the other reviewer complained about their smell.  They smell fine to me."
"I have been using Liquid Health k-9 for several years after using another brand which was more expensive.Our oldest dog(near eleven years) just had his acl repaired and the vet said his arthritis was much better than a lot of younger dogs he had seen.I contribute this to diet,excersise and glucosamine which by the way the vet believed in.Great product for the price and all 3 of our dogs like the taste."
"My husband and I eat this cereal almost every day (probably five out of seven) and have it delivered via subscription.  For me personally, it is a tad on the sweet side, so I often add about one part ""generic"" Rice Krispies to about four parts granola and mix them in a large Tupperware container ... that maintains the nice light but crispy texture."
I love this oil! I use it for everything from cooking with it to using it as a moisturizer and on my scalp for dandruff. I would totally recommend this to everyone!
"I live in China, and this is a product I am unable to find where I live. Whenever we travel to the States or my in-laws pay us a visit, Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce makes it to over to the Middle Kingdom. I prefer this product in their 1 gallon plastic containers because of the sheer size. My wife uses Frank's Hot Sauce when making me some mean buffalo wings, and I've also enjoyed the sauce mixed with rice. My wife has laughed at me, but I think it's absolutely delicious! We haven't used the sauce with a lot of other recipes, however I feel it would go well with many dishes. I almost want to drink the stuff. My eight-year-old is not big on spicy food, but she actually likes this hot sauce in small quantities. Although I don't find Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce to be very hot, I feel it has just the right amount of kick. If you are looking for something hotter, I recommend Frank's RedHot Xtra Hot Sauce."
This is a smooth coffee with a good taste.  I don't like overly sweet flavored coffees and this one is perfect.  It has just the right flavor and it is not bitter at all.
"While not exactly like eggs it is pretty darn close. The main difference between these and eggs I would say is the consistency. If all you are doing is scrambled eggs or baking then it probably won't be noticeable. However, if you were to make an Omelet for example you would likely notice the texture difference. OvaEasy is very consistent both in color and texture, real eggs however are not.<br /><br />Flavor wise they are pretty darn close to real eggs. If you couldn't tell the difference between the texture then you probably wouldn't know the difference. A nice easy measuring spoon of sorts would be nice for cooking purposes so you could easily calculate how many eggs you were making, but I also wonder how accurate their measurement per egg is as well as it does seem a little on the small side.<br /><br />I have not attempted any baking with this yet, but imagine it will work just like regular eggs given how they cook up directly in a pan. The real trick here is going to be in measuring out the correct amount of egg. On a side note, I have found that the shaker bottles work well for mixing up the egg."
My 2 dogs and my 2 cats go crazy for these things.  I also like they are Made in America.
"...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible."
"My favorite is the Mae Ploy Panang style curry paste, but the red is an excellent choice. Not as hot as the Panang, but great classic red curry flavor."
My husband and I both love this.I buy it at Walmart and it is deffinately cheaper.My Walmart has this at 2 for a dollar.
"I bought the 12 bottle variety to try out.  I just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well.<br /><br />First off.  The baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper.  We did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine.<br /><br />The are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper.  The first is the Wisconsin White Birch, which popped up big, fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels.  The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels.<br /><br />Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume).<br /><br />There was only one variety that I would not ever use again.  The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper.<br /><br />Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels.  The Blue Heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels.  Sunset Fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully."
"I use this product everyday and I have continued to buy it since I discovered it.  I put it with rice milk, or with fruit in a smoothie, etc.  If you just put it in water and drink it, then yes it is grainy.  I don't do that and don't recommend such.  It really helps to balance the blood sugar and keep the body happy.  It is satisfying in keeping the appetite down.  It keeps my lower tract running well.  It is high protein and has carb balance as well.  Be sure to add it with something to avoid the gritty taste.  It wasn't designed to be drank with just water though a person could do it.  I've tried the more expensive Nutiva blends that have flavors added and they are great.  Nutiva does a good job in producing healthy products.  This particular hemp protein powder is effective and it is the cheapest among the hemp protein lines so I just add my own fruit, maca, etc.  If you want to stay economical and add your own blend to it then you have a program that works great.  If you want a sweeter taste then buy the other types of Nutiva hemp as they have several great flavors. I highly recommend Nutiva hemp."
"This is a new favorite in our house, for us grown-ups and the kids alike.  It's crunchy with just enough sweetness, and seems to hold its own in a bowl of milk.  My kids also love it in their snack packs.  With most other cereals, I'm hungry well before lunch, but the oatmeal squares seem to last me at least 4-5 hours.  We love these!"
"One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it. Someone wanting to be on TV, go figure."
I bought this from amazon and i thought i got a good deal until my wife went to the Chinese super market and found that they are selling $9.95 per box.  more than 100% mark up.<br /><br />oh well cant return them now because I have already opened one box and use 1/3 of it.
The advertisement was not clear about if it is beans or grounded coffee. It is grounded.
"Whereever I am, no matter the situation, if I see this ginger ale I buy at least a few bottles. There is no better ginger ale in the world. I've got a guy who sells me a 24-pack for $35 but even the price here is reasonable. It's also great to have at a party as a non-alcoholic drink."
Great rice! I usually use rice cooker and make sticky rice. This is perfect for that. Plus it has nice smell and tastes fantastic. Gotta love Jasmine. This is great quality at a very reasonable price.
"Great for diabetics who struggle with what to have for healthy snacks!  Ordering online couldn't be any easier or more convenient with very quick/efficient delivery.  The online price is better than in the stores, too.  I couldn't be happier."
We have really enjoyed this coffee over the years but it can be hard to find.
"This was a pricey gamble because my 4lb chihuahua is a very PICKY eater. She now gets excited at meal times & wont eat anything but this food. Yes its expensive but its cheaper then having to throw out food cause she wont eat it & shes not that big so she eats only 2 patties a day max. If you have a small picky eater this is GREAT & seems to be very healthy. If you have a large dog this might be a healthy thing to add to their dryfood (not to mention a nice way to spice up their food). I highly suggest the freeze dried Duck, Duck, Goose Stella & Chewy's version. I tried the frozen version & my dog wasnt as interested."
"I trust Alvita's brand because all of the teas I have tried from them are pure and excellent quality. The Raspberry leaf is no exception. The taste is mild and it works like a charm to ease menstrual cramps. A must have during your moon cycle. Good value for the price.<br /><br />Also check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLQ"">Yogi Woman's Moon Cycle, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
I am not sure why this product is no longer in the stores.  Just like the good taste of iced tea with out anything added!.<br />Don't want to fill my fridge with a whole pitcher of sun  tea or make it from scratch  just like it one glass at a time.<br />Thanks Amazon!
"I have used this sauce mix for 40 years.  They no longer pack the retail/ home use size. I got this and use 2Tbls. per 6oz can of tomato paste.  It is flavorful, easy and most economical."
"I love plain cheerios but sometimes a little cheerio diversity is called for.  The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.  I love pairing a bowl of these cheerios with so delicious coconut milk and sliced banana pieces.  The combination of the three easily keep me satiated from breakfast until lunch.  I occasionally mix this banana nut flavor with chocolate cheerios for an even sweeter, exceptional treat.<br /><br />While I do not find the banana nut flavor to be overly sweet, one should not overlook that sugar is the second ingredient for this food and, the sugar content is relatively high -- especially for frequent use by children.  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons in a single 3/4 cup serving of banana nut cheerios. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this cereal may be high for frequent consumption. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end. If you child is getting 2 and 1/4 teaspoons with this cereal, your child has consumed a fair amount of sugar for the morning.<br /><br />When paired with fresh bananas, this cereal can be filling but if limiting sugar for your kids (or your own meals), you might want to use sparingly."
"Purchased this because I fell in love with the regular (yellow bottle) version of this and was buying it in a convenient store at $3/bottle.  This version tastes almost the same with no noticeable ""sweetener"" flavor and saves many calories (due to the lack of sugar, but NOT sugar-free).  You may find cheaper in the store (locally was $5.99/4pack while amazon is $22.71/12pack), but the convenience cannot be beat.  And my last purchase (March 18, 2012) was good until Jan 2013."
"I ordered this for my boyfriend for our two years anniversary and I'm glad to have ordered a bonsai tree from Bonsai Boy! It arrived within a week. The tree was well secured and in perfect condition when it arrived. The arrangement with the rocks, a little lantern, a bridge and a fisherman was great and the tree is beautifully shaped. Simply amazing arrangement. Looking forward from ordering more from Bonsai Boy. :)"
Great coffee if you like an extra bold coffee.  In the top 2 I know of in extra bold coffees.
"This BBQ sauce is very flavorful, but not hot at all.  I really don't taste ""mustard"".  It is a delight to have something that will allow me to stay on my eating plan and keep my blood sugar in check."
"I liked the Planter's snack bars.  Basically it is a larger and higher calorie version of a regular granola bar with the added joy of having fat planter's peanuts on top.<br /><br />As other have said, it is not a diet bar and is probably a bit messier than your average granola bar which are always nice to have in the car.  However it is tasty and sweet and depending on what you are looking for in a granola bar (did I just type that) this should satisfy both your sweet and salty cravings."
"My dogs loved these treats.  They are bigger than what I had originally expected.  I thought they were a tiny strips of duck meat wrapped around a sweet potato fry, which in a sense they are.  They are actually a whole breast or at least half of one wrapped around a sweet potato fry.  Much more meat than I expected.  These take my dogs a few minutes to gobble up instead of just a few seconds with other treats.<br /><br />I like the fact that the ingredients only state duck meat and sweet potato, no harsh preservatives you tend to find in most treats, especially ones that come from China.<br /><br />The cost compared to the amount you get is well worth the price I paid.  My dogs go through about 2 of these each a day which a bag will last me about a week or so.  I definitely plan on buying more of these, its to bad they don't have the automatic delivery for these as they do for coffee because I would definitely sign up.<br /><br />I highly recommend these treats."
This is similar to a herbal that I mix up myself from bulk teas.I now have enough to last all winter.<br />I brew it up then chill it. sometimes I add a little sweetener.
"They come in bags, I think nitrogen sealed. It is enough to last a week each bag.<br /><br />Flavor: Very bold, very strong but not bitter or acidic. Very much like costco coffee<br />but far more flavorful and complex.<br /><br />Can do a full 10 oz and it is still strong with milk.<br /><br />Less plastic to waste"
"I look forward to these cake-like ginger spice cookies at the start of every Christmas season. As to their authenticity, I lived near Munich (M&uuml;nchen) in Germany when a child over 35 years ago, and they are the exact same cookies we ate back then. They are the perfect mixture of sweet and spice; and lightly crunchy on the outside, spongy soft inside. No other brand or variation will suffice for me, not even the fully chocolate-coated version which -- while still very good -- throws off the delicate balance of flavors. A literal translation of ""lebkuchen"" is ""life cakes"", and once you've tried these confections you may understand why.<br /><br />They are hard to find in local stores. I've had reasonable luck finding them at Cost Plus World Market (usually ranging six to eight bucks per package), although they fly off the shelves fairly quickly with almost no chance of a reorder before Christmas."
"I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!"
"I've found the holy grail of gluten-free cookies!! This shortbread is simply PERFECT: wonderfully light, crispy, and buttery; flavored just right; not too sweet--and I can eat it despite my numerous dietary restrictions! In fact, it's easy to forget that these wonders are gluten-, egg-, dairy-, corn- and transfat-free, because they just taste like a really well-made cookie (which they are) and not like some substitute-laden excuse for a cookie (which I'm sure you've endured if you have these dietary restrictions). I've also tried Sun Flour Baking Co.'s lemon shortbread (also sold here), and it is equally as satisfying. Maybe the ""lots of love"" listed in the ingredients is what is doing the culinary trick here, but whatever SFBC is doing, I hope they keep it up for a very long time! I am hooked!"
I am trying to cut down on all sweetners.  This stuff is a bit sweeter than sugar so I use less and I am slowly cutting down.  I know this box will probably last a long time.  You can't find it cheaper anywhere else.  This is it look no further.  Free super saving shipping and it's faster than they say it is.  Can't beat it. Great price. Great product.
Love them!  Great deal.  Waiting for you to put another bulk order up so I can buy them again!  I'm running low
"My first experience with GF cookies.  Giving up the ""regular"" cookies, breads and pastas I love has been challenging, to say the least.  I purchased these cookies based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.  The taste, flavor and texture of these cookies is very good.  It was a bit disappointing that most of the cookies had broken, but I understand that's pretty common for GF baked goods, especially when they have to be shipped.  Nonetheless, they were good enough that none of the crumbles were wasted -- I just sprinkled them on top of vanilla ice cream and that was even better.  I most likely will order these again.  The package arrived quickly and in good shape with the cookies securely wrapped in plastic wrap over the paper-type cookie container."
"I grabbed one of these on a whim while shopping at Northern Tool.  I was in need of a low calorie, high protein snack and this fit the bill.  Little did I know that it was going to taste so great.  The flavor is so incredible.  There is a hint of sweet and and hint of spice to give it a bit of a kick.  The fact that I can enjoy it as an occasional snack without it wrecking my daily calorie intake, absolutely puts this one over the top.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
Awesome product for keeping my doggies teeth clean and tarter free. It must be used everyday to be effective. I would highly recommend it for any breed.
"See that ooey gooey chocolate stretching between the two pieces of cookie on bag? That doesn't happen, even when the cookies are warm. The chocolate is actually quite stiff and dry. Another one of those ""got milk?"" products. I like plain old Chips Ahoy and would stick with those before diving into these and being disappointed again.<br /><br />And I'm not alone -- people in my office weren't impressed either -- and we'll eat anything."
Though if bitter is what you are going for...well buy it.  Just not palatable for me.
"Great little bar. It's chewy and tangy. I like the texture of eating the chia seeds and it's healthier than eating artificially flavored gummy snacks. Just to be clear, this isn't a PACK of bars like in the picture. It's only one bar that comes in an envelope. Taste is great, but it's pricy."
"Great product. Does not completely get rid of hot flashes and night sweats, but seriously reduces their number and intensity. I tried everything else and this is the only thing that made any difference. I now get reasonable sleep at night."
"Just tried the ""new great taste""-labeled Spearmint Altoids and they are HORRIBLE.  For some reason, the Oil of Spearmint has been removed and replaced with artificial flavoring.  These don't even taste like spearmint..."
This is a delicious blend that is a nice alternative to traditional tea.  Good served hot or cold.
"Hint water is everything you could ask for!  Refreshment with no sugar, calories, preservatives.  All the wholesomeness and refreshment and taste satisfaction you could want!  I love every flavor of Hint!  I can give it to the kids and know that they won't be ""sugared up"".  Thanks for creating a healthy alternative to soda.  You have won me over!"
I love these. I am very skeptical about healthy and tastes good in the same sentence but these chips fit the bill!
I Live in Hawaii and you cannot find these anywhere here. I am from the southeast area and I used to eat them everyday .I pay alot of money to have these shipped to hawaii four 6lb cans at a time . I will continue to buy them until I move back to georgia in 6 months .
"I'd had no idea oatmeal could vary so much in flavor & quality before trying Flahavan's.  I'd tried regular & specialty brands here in the U.S. including organic, steel-cut, and specialty-mill varieties.<br />Flahavan's came on the radar by chance & now there is no turning back.<br />It's difficult to understand how oatmeal could have such a creamy, airy, & delicate aromatic quality but Flahavan's does it.  Obviously this is not news to the Irish--but would guess most of us Americans have no clue what we're missing!"
"This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma."
"Taylor's of Harrogate makes a line of very good teas, not readily available in this country.  It's nice to be able to buy this very tasty loose tea in bulk."
"I LOVE pop chips!  I like salty snacks and having one this low calorie is great.  I did think that the single serve bags of salt and vinegar has less flavor than the bigger bags, so I think next time I buy in bulk I'll get the bigger bags."
Glad to know that this product is available at Amazon.  It is simple fool-proof and always delicious.  Will purchase again after my four are used.
"I was disappointed with the cube. It is almost impossible to open. Finally I used the handle of a pair of pliers, after seeing a video on youtube, and I tore up the handle of the pliers opening it, it was that hard. The kibble either doesn't come out, and my dog gets frustrated and barks, or it comes out 5 pieces at once, and I have to refill it all the time. It also slides along the ground more often than it rolls over to dispense kibble. Maybe that's because my dog is too small to roll it? He's 6 pounds.<br /><br />One more thing, the instructions both on the product and Buster Cube's website refer to ""min"" and ""max"" settings. There is no such thing on the cube, only ""lock"" and ""unlock"" settings.<br /><br />My dog loves it though, so it gets 3 stars."
"Our 20 lb mini poodle loves these treats! He has to work on one for about 15 minutes, which beats most treats that just get gobbled in a few seconds. They're kind of freaky looking, but your dog won't care. Highly recommended."
"I bought this out of curiosity, after hearing the buzz about it on the internet. I took my chances and bought 10 packages of these.<br />They are fantastic! It came in a box, with 10 individual wrapped packages.<br />These freeze dried ice creams are broken into pieces (Stop blaming packaging!) for a reason, so they are more easier to bite into, and because they crumble after being freeze dried at -40 degrees!<br />I love these, and I am definitely planning to buy more, just in different flavors (this flavor is great, I just don't like vanilla. Strawberry is very enjoyable). Very light and compact, and you can bring it with you in a bag or a purse when you're craving ice cream but it's raining, or whatever.<br />Highly recommended! Cheers, Amazon."
"I have a 12 pound, 18 month old couton.  He would rate these as 5 stars.<br /><br />The problem is, he finishes these off in 5 minutes.<br /><br />This makes it an expensive dog biscuit, rather than a dental chew toy."
Product arrived in a timely manner in store showcase packaging.  Good quality and is exactly what I expected.
I wouldn't try this cereal if I were you because it is addicting!  I love it!
"These are the best bon bons I have ever tasting, but watch out because they are so addicting.<br />I've tried alot of lozenges and drops, but these take the cake."
"I like the light Peppermint flavor. I usually use it with a regular Black Tea bag and<br />it really taste Good. Makes a great after breakfast tea, too get the day started..:)"
Simply the best hot sauce available right now. I was hooked the first time I tried it and haven't looked back since. Great great sauce
"JUST LOVE IT! gonna buy some more!!! Easy to open close bag, fine salt, love to use it, healthy, tasty!"
"I love nuts of all kinds, and eat some almonds and walnuts every day. I've tried all the brands of almonds--salted, unsalted, raw, dry-roasted, spiced, cocoa covered, you name it. These are by far the tastiest of all brands and types I've tried. Great texture, a hint of salt...just right. The only problem with these is that they're so delicious its hard to stop eating them. Plus, Amazon beats the store price. Love them..."
"My friend and her daughter loved their gift basket of chocolates over the holidays!  They love chocolate and nuts, and the variety w/ the nuts was great!  The only downside was the carrier had a hard time finding the address and it didn't get there by Christmas."
"I love Tully's Kona Blend.  It's my favorite over all other k-cup coffee.  Unfortunately, the k-cup packaging is so cheap in the Keurig machines that I get grounds in almost every cup.  Wish they would improve the cups so I can return to the best ever coffee. I would rate them a 5+ as the flavor is perfectly bold with little acidity."
This product is sturdy and well made.  The portion is perfect. It has a lid which keeps food clean and easy to stack. I have one in orange as well as green.  My baby is 11 months now.  I wish I would have purchased more in different colors but I got by with freezing and storing in freezer bags.  I think I can reuse Beaba freezer trays after I stop making baby food.
"Great buy!  Fantastic taste and pleasing pink hue from the iron content.  I prefer a grinding salt, and this one is unprocessed for it's better for you."
I ordered this because I used it in England.  Being a Prime I assumed it was covered .. Yes I know .. I should have checked the somewhat finer print .<br />So it's all my fault and I haven't cancelled the order but be warned and watch the shipping cost.. I orderd 4 bottles.. here is my cost plus Shipping<br />Subtotal of Items:  $18.40<br />Shipping & Handling:  $42.26<br />  ------<br />Total for this Order:  $60.66<br /><br />Any questions as to why I feel like a fool ?<br /><br />Good stuff by hardly work 15 bucks a bottle.  I could have just gone to a local store and paid less than half this amount.
"I handed out samples to my parents toy poodles and my Newfoundland and they all thoroughly enjoyed them. The size of the treat is more appropriate for a small to medium dog than my large Newf, though that didn't stop her from wanting one when I picked up the bag.<br /><br />The ingredient list is pretty basic, which is good. Preservatives always make me a little uneasy, but the list is much better than the typical grocery store brand. If they were a snack for me, I'd say they went a little too heavy on the smoke flavor. The dogs didn't mind, and the smell didn't seem to stay on my hands for too long.<br /><br />I won't be buying them again, but primarily because of my dog's size, and because she would much rather have a piece of broccoli or some beans than something out of a plastic bag (odd, I know)."
"I've been waiting for this variety to come to Amazon, since purchasing a box locally (and paying a pretty penny...$4 a box!) and really enjoying it.<br /><br />Don't let the ""cocoa"" in the description mislead you...this doesn't taste like hot chocolate. The cocoa flavor is really subtle, and it gives this tea a really full, rich taste. I am usually a coffee drinker, but I think I could switch for this tea. I take it with some milk and sugar. Highly recommended."
"My dog eats Nature's Recipe ""Easy to Digest"" dry food everyday. It really helped with her digestive issues. I thought the wet food version would be okay, but it made me completely ill. She was dry-heaving, had major gas issues and was quite lethargic. About 12 hours after her final dose of it, all of her symptoms disappeared. The dry food is still great, but this wet food is really awful."
This is the only boxed rice side dish my family likes and buying it on Amazon's grocery store is a great value rather than paying grocery store prices.
"I hope that Kellogg's doesn't stop manufacturing these wonderful chocolate treats, because that's how highly I think of them.  I usually eat Frosted Mini-Wheats for breakfast as I know they are healthy and I enjoyed the various types that were available in my local supermarket.  But, when I saw that they were available in chocolate, well I was delighted and subscribed to have them delivered by Amazon on a regular basis.  By the way, if one likes just a taste of chocolate in the evening, without the calories, these fit the bill."
"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!"
"If you're not into a healthy lifestyle, get these - they are DELICIOUS! ""You can't eat just one!""<br />It contains MSG and other ""stuff."" - You've been warned! It's very delicious, though..."
"This coffee is delicious, strong and has just tiny bit of a burnt taste to it that my husband and I found really adds to the flavor. In fact we like it so much that this will probably wind up being our number one go to coffee. So, bye bye Starbucks."
"I recently bought this item based on the good reviews I saw here. However, I was dismayed to learn that this tea is actually decaffeinated! This fact is hidden on the back of the box, while it should be in the product's name."
"To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they ""source fresh fruit"" and that "" We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products.""  I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.  I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together."
We liked Village Mixes apple crisp so much we used it in our hotel welcome baskets for our wedding! Highly recommend...
"Wanted to thank for such a great product! It's absolutely delicious! Its consistency and taste proves that it has not been processed or diluted with sugar and water. If you compare it with processed honey that is sold in stores you would actually feel there is a raw taste to this brand. Processed honey has syrup-like taste and it stays liquid for a long time. If you are looking for raw honey, you have to know that it changes its color and consistency over time.<br />I have also noticed that no matter how much you can eat it, this honey does not make your stomach upset unlike processed store brands.<br /><br />In order for honey to be beneficial it has to be raw! There is no way it can deliver all its goodness to you if it's been processed! Honey is a wonder food! It has been scientifically proven to help heal wounds as it has antibacterial properties; to help restore healthy intestinal flora as it is a prebiotic; help recover from illnesses faster; help you sleep better; restore your nervous system after stressful events (try a cup of herbal tea with raw honey after a stressful day!) and even make your skin contain moisture. Raw unprocessed honey does not make your sugar spike if you are diabetic. But it absolutely has to be raw! If you buy processed honey you just waste your money, you can as well just buy some high fructose corn syrup....<br />Thank you for selling your honey raw! I wish one day people will be educated enough to avoid processed foods."
"This sugar free licorice was a present for my diabetic sister-in-law. She loves it. I like the nice smaller size tubs, so she is not tempted to eat it all at once."
"This drink is so delicious. I'd had the chocolate chai before, so thought I'd try the vanilla chai. Though the vanilla taste is not as strong as the chocolate taste, it's still so yummy. Great price on amazon too!"
"These oreo's were great, my family gobbled them up without conscience, i even had to hide some packs around the house so they would not over eat them hahaha. All i can say about these is Excellent i would reccommend these to every one. We even got a few people hooked as you dont see these in your every day supermarket in Denmark. Just great taste, fresh and delicious.<br />Yours Natasha (DENMARK)"
"Big Train Vanilla Chai is very good, mixes great unlike other instant chai's I have tried hot or cold!  I order every other month! Fast, reliable shipping!"
"Yes, I mean sweet. It is good when drinking coffee, but for eating alone it's kinda too sweet for me."
"This is a wonderful ""bush"" tea.  Though I am generally partial to caffeinated beverages, I find that the aroma and taste of this give me enough buzz to do without the caffeine.  How can you not love a tea that has chocolate, vanilla and mint?  This is very good either hot or iced.  The smell is so great you need to remember it's for drinking.  Enjoy!"
"Be forewarned! These gummy bears are tasty, but if you eat more than a couple at a time, you will get a bad tummy ache and diarrhea. On top of that, there are no nutritional information available, so who knows whether they are actually completely sugar free, and I also wonder about the carbohydrate content. Even my friend who is diabetic would not eat them because he said he would rather eat nothing than suffer with stomach cramps. I seriously only had a handful, and then about 2 hrs later, I got a terrible stomach ache and diarhea. I ended up throwing away the whole bag! What a waste of money!"
Love this stuff for the taste and the fact that it dissolves well and does not leave a lot of sediment in the bottom of the cup
"I've been reading and studying the benefits of honey and have been purchasing different varieties and brands trying to find one that I like to add to my food regimen.  After tasting Orange Blossom Honey from Florida, I purchased this brand as well as Miller's both from California. Topanga Brand honey is by far the best of all three.  The honey I received is darker in color than the others but has a richer, sweeter taste with a nice citrus scent. I would definitely recommend this honey to my friends and family and will continue to purchase more for myself and to give as gifts to the honey lovers in my family.  This honey is SO VERY GOOD!!!!!"
"I have 2 dogs, and they love these. One of my dogs is choicy and he barks when he wants a treat. If I give him the wrong one, he ups the barking. When I give him this, he gets down to chewing. He chews the coating off first and eats that."
"These are some of my favorite bars, but these were old and very tough. I could not find a date on them, but they were obviously old.  I will not order these on-line again."
"This is really good coffee.  We were on vacation and needed coffee - the local Publix store (we don't have those where we live) happened to carry this so we gave it a try.  We were really surprised and pleased at how good this coffee is.  We're no snobs, but considering we have a burr grinder and usually grind our own beans...that really says a lot about this stuff.  It is NOT bitter at all!  Like another reviewer said, we are not fans of dark roasts either.  We can't find this coffee anywhere here locally so we had to go on amazon subscribe and save.  That works!"
"I was disappointed when I drank my first k cup ice tea.  I love iced tea, however I do not like lemon in my tea at all - I just want the taste of the tea leaves.  The Celestial English Breakfast Black Tea has a lemon flavoring added.  Ugh ... I was really hopeful I could brew a glass of ice tea with my Keurig.  It is not bad tasting at all - it is just not what I prefer."
"These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use & is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee.<br /><br />Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee & these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.<br /><br />What more could a person want?!"
"Lets face it - the Mexicans love hot food and generally know how to make a fine hot sauce. While the label (in small print) says ""extra hot"" there are many other sauces which are far hotter.  Think in terms of needing 5 or 6 drops for a bloody mary rather than spoonfuls when using this sauce. It is far from being ""extra hot"". I'd call it medium hot.<br /><br />Important: There is a significant difference between this ""extra hot"" variety of Valentina hot sauce and their regular variety. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called ""extra hot"" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the ""extra hot"" is far superior.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt ...<br /><br />Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!<br /><br />Normally I don't like any vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular version of Valentina. The difference may be this sauce uses actual vinegar while most others use acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar) and the chili peppers dominate in this particular variety of Valentina. I want to emphasize that this is ONLY true for this particular blend.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a nicely blended hot sauce worthy of your consideration. My four star rating means this is a very good hot sauce but, depending on your palette, you might find a few that are better.<br /><br />Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina and the ""extra hot"" (black label) variety that I'm reviewing here. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is painfully evident while the ""extra hot"" variety is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label.<br /><br />This is a near perfect hot sauce for a bloody mary and most other foods.<br /><br />BTW: Watch out for sellers that price the sauce low but charge very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis"
this product is equal to or better than any product on the market in my view....i really like the way over easy eggs turn out and have no after taste....buy it you will love it!!!
"First thing I did was check the ingredients.  No wheat and no corn.  That's good.  The main ingredients are good animal protein sources.<br /><br />There were two flavors in the pack I received:  Chicken pot pie and sesame chicken.  The sesame chicken smelled great!  I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.  My cat didn't seem to mind so why should I?  He ate it all.<br /><br />Bottom line...good ingredients, cat likes it.  Five paws up."
We have been ordering this coffee for over a year and we like it better than any other coffees we have tried. Sometimes the beans are fresh and look oily. Other times they are dry and lack aroma. We were ordering direct from Coffee Bean Direct and got fresher coffee than the coffer we get from Amazon on the automatic ordering system to save money. I don't know if they warehouse the coffee longer than the Coffee Bean Direct or what. There is a difference. If the freshness does not improve soon We will go back to ordering from Coffee Bean Direct and paying more. When it is fresh it is a five-star coffee.
"I have been forced into a sugar free lifestyle for health reasons and have been trying to find a decent toffee / caramel SF candy for a while. I was skeptical with the malitol on the ingredients list. So far nothing with malitol tastes ""RIGHT"" to me. But Judy's Candy Co. smacked one out of the park on this. I picked up Vanilla Almond Caramels, Butter Toffee, and Triple Treat today and OMG so so good!!"
"We have a black female lab. And since she was little she would not eat anything but pedigree and as long as shd was fine we gave it to her. For the past 3 months she was licking her paws, itching, she had bald spots. I treated her with different kind of oitments which brought her coat back at thr bald spots however she was still licking and itching, shaking. We finally decided to change her food from that horrible by products pedigree to wellness and two days later less itching licking and everything. Although it is pricey i dont care she is herself again!"
"I am not a huge fan of coffee, however, this coffee is excellent.  The aroma while it is brewing is outstanding and it really delivers once you take a drink.  The vanilla flavor is strong, but not overpowering, the coffee has a nice full taste.  I have served this to a few friends and they all loved it as well.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice flavored coffee!"
"I certainly could do better by these if I just went over to Grama's house and raided her flowerbeds. I am not sure what I truly expected but it was not a bag a teeny microscopic half brown buds. The package is not sealed and one side is just dust where the buds crumbled. I showed the pic of the good side to point out the brown ones. The smell upon opening was overwhelming with the first whiff. Then it evaporated immediately and left a strong rank tea like chemically enhanced odor. I assure you I will not be using these for human consumption due to that lingering odor. Since they bare not commercially packaged etc, there is not guarantee of being purely organic. Unless by organic they mean dead, rotted, brown plant material."
"I bought these crackers based upon the reviews, but we just don't care for them.  We wanted a whole grain cracker, and this product meets that requirement......but we think the crackers are flimsy and taste quite bland.  They don't seem to have the texture that we have enjoyed in other crackers.  Just a matter of taste, I guess, but we are going back to the Crunchmasterr crackers if we can find them."
"I know there's countless products of popcorn out there all across this planet! True, however, there's only one that covers the full specimen that we need to fully enjoy the perfection we should expect from popcorn, that's Great Northern Popcorn!<br /><br /> I know this for I order a full case and never regretted it it's perfection and I'll stand by this statement as to my name, why settle for any less than the very best in life, that's Great Northern Popcorn!"
"This product is a superior light biscotti, crunchy without being hard, and with a light coating of chocolate.  The texture is good, and the flavor is good.  Each piece is 110 calories.  It makes a good snack for a mid-afternoon break, or can be added into a brown bag lunch.  The chocolate coating is heat sensitive, and I would recommend against shipping it in hot weather."
For those of you like me who care... These yummy snacks have about 140 Calories per package and one package is too much for one sitting. Very yummy and sweet lo-cal food to snack on.
"I love the Bread and Chocolate bar.  It is delicious dark chocolate, fairly sweet, and then the bread gives it a hint of salty goodness.  Plus it's Theo's so it is guilt-free as far as being a conscientious consumer goes.  I've toured their factory and everything is fair trade.  Thank you, Premium Organic Cafe, for offering this online!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VUETIA"">Bread & Chocolate</a>"
"These are soooo good!  They are a bit larger than regular bagged gummi bears.  I can also confirm what the other person said about being ""mushy,"" but I much prefer the texture of these to the regular gummies.  I would describe them as softer and tender.  But if you like the harder, more chewy version, you might not like these.<br /><br />I read in another spot someone complaining because they are yellowish instead of clear like they seem in the picture.  They are indeed slightly yellow (very pale) and not clear. So, if you are buying them as a decoration, beware!<br /><br />The only problem I have with them is not eating the entire bag in one sitting."
"this product is o.k. but i think you can get away w/out it and be fine ...not really worth the money. CONS: it only makes a very small amount of food at once. if I am going through the trouble, i'd rather make a bigger batch and freeze it. Also, the lid on the resevoir gets so hot and is shaped oddly so that it is difficult to get a grip of it to take off. a serious caution, the booklet i got w/ mine (purchased in 2008) has recipes that include foods that you are not supposed to give to babies under a year old!!!!!finally, the blend mode does not have an optional 'stay on' so that if you want to puree something, you need to stand there and hold the button. you can't do something else while it's blending b/c you need to be right there to keep it running. PROS: technically, it does what it says it does, and it is easy to clean. I find that even though i own this, i tend to use my good old pan w/ a steamer basket and then puree in my food processor. works just as well, saves time, and makes more at once."
"Delicate scent, light amber color, not bitter, no aftertaste, delicious with a touch of sweetner, white tea has more antioxidents and less caffiene than black and green teas. It is always so nice to sit down with a cup of this lovely raspberry scented tea. It is my current favorite and I have trouble finding it locally so I am glad I can order it here."
I agree that this granola is not as yummy when eaten like cereal BUT this granola has become a staple in my yogurt eating :).  I have used it in regular yogurt or coconut milk yogurt and it gives it crunch and extra flavor.  I love crunch in my yogurt and this doesn't get soggy fast.  I also really like the chewy raisins.  I am not a big fan of raisins but the raisins in this mix are drier and chewier than regular raisins and I really like them.
By far the best flavored coffee for the Keurig.  Not particularly strong...use the 7oz setting...but very nice.
This is the best black tea that you will find.  I can only find them on<br />AMAZON and really do not even look in the stores anymore as I can just<br />order through AMAZON.
"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS."
"Well, this was the first time I tried a bread maker.  I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked."
"My cats are more enthusiastic about Turducken than just about any other cat food. They literally lick the plate clean. Even my LaPerm, who usually just gives me ""silent meows,"" manages to squeak out an audible meow when I start putting this on a plate.  The ingredients are much higher quality than many brands, too (no by-products, corn, etc.). I will be ordering more."
"Purchased two pkges of Fruitables All-Natural Pumpkin & Banana Dog Treats, and Fruitables All-Natural Pumpkin & Apple Dog Treats, both in resealabnle 7-Ounce Pouches to supplement the natural fruits/veggies that my dog is permitted on his diet and he loves them.  Also purchased the Organic Pumpkin as an added supplement that I now add to his regular daily feedings and he's losing weight each month.  Initially weighed in at a hefty 52 pounds, now weighs 46.5 pounds and he's enjoying far more energy, delicious meals and an improved interest in active (interactive) play times.  With his breed having a 10-12 year life expectancy, it's amazing to see how at eight and a half years of age, he's behaving more like a lively puppy again."
I must agree with the previous review. I don't care for the new Lipton Tea to Go with Honey. I also hope it flops. The original Tea to Go was really good and I bought it all the time. Amazon's price is outrageous. Scalping at it worst.
"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever."
"IF YOU WANT A HIGH ENERGY, AND GREAT TASTING (AND I MEAN THE VERY BEST)ENERGY DRINKS, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU! BEVNET.COM SAYS IT TASTES LIKE MOUNTAIN DEW, AND IT DOES! VOTED BEST TASTING! HAS JIFFY INGREDIENT THAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT CALLED D-RIBOSE, AND IT IS A SIMPLE SUGAR THAT IS GREAT FOR ATHLETES! NO BAD THINGS HERE. I HAD A BAD BATCH ONCE, BUT IT WAS A FLUKE."
"I love this coffee.  So far have only had the vanilla but going to try the others.  It is like having a cappuccino in a coffee house. Try it, you'll love it."
I love this coffee.  I love my coffee strong and rich tasting and this fits the bill. I will definitely purchase this again.
"I love this apple cider for a sweet treat without any sugar or guilt.<br />Wonderful in the fall or winter. Much better for me than a real caramel apple or pie.<br />It is a great decaffeinated alternative to tea or coffee and kids love it.<br />It is very sweet, but I use extra water for a larger cup.<br />I have also opened it up and used it to cook with.<br />The mix inside does not brew, just rehydrates, which allows me to use it at work without a Kurieg."
"after tasting some of the competition recommended by some of the low reviews here, I have to say that these are the best. Better flavors, actual unique flavors with each color versus just having different colors that taste all the same, and they are supposed to be hard. That's why I like them. If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.<br /><br />For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.<br /><br />Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity. The Turkish ones are blander, with a pleasing almost vanilla taste to them that I do enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line, try both, they are both quite good, but distinctly different as well. Buy both, or pick your favorite."
"The most fabulous new flavor ever! spearmint, grn tea,passion fruit& plum. I've become totally addicted to this on ice during this (too) hot summer. Highly recommended!"
GoGo rice is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to have great tasting brown rice that is easily microwavable in a few minutes.  Excellent taste and super convenient for dormitory.  5 stars for sure.
Excellent syrup!  If you haven't tried REAL maple syrup then you are missing out.  Try this delicious treat on your next waffle/pancake/ect...
I ordered this product a week before my mom's birthday because it is her favorite topping for popcorn and it came the day before her birthday. I was impressed with the fast shipping and the product was exactly what I expected. I can no longer find this product in the grocery stores in my area so I was happy. But you have to use this product frequently to use it before the expiration date (mine gave me a little over 2 months to use it).
"My two sons have a host of food allergies. These Super Chips meet their allergen criteria, and being raw, they are very healthy. Most importantly, my sons love them! The chips are bite sized and crunchy. It makes for a great snack food or meal treat. The name is also fun. I think my boys enjoy the fact that ""super"" is in the name and associate the name with pretending that they are super heros! I'm thankful to have found these on Amazon as they're less expensive here than in health food stores. Yay!"
"Runa is a brand new tea that I drink everyday. I love the balanced, energizing feel I get from it. Apparently guayusa has been drunk for thousands of years in the rain forests of Ecuador and is now making its way to market in the US for the first time. Runa also seems to have a great back story of environmental conservation and social empowerment of indigenous groups. In fact I just heard a story covered on NPR's Marketplace about the partnership between Runa, the socialist Ecuadorian government and the farmers.<br /><br />The Amazon Spice has a nice cinnamon undertone with high notes from the lemongrass, the Ginger Citrus is also really good and slightly spicier from the ginger with clean citrus zest flavor, the traditional is good to see what guayusa by itself tastes like- smooth and naturally, subtly sweet with no tannin. I've never had the spearmint but I bet its good for people who like mint tea."
"The candy is great, but a little too hard. Other than that we are enjoying it. They shipped it fast and we got it when it was expected."
"I have tried many k-kup varieties and this is my favorite.  Mild, perfect for someone who likes a mellow coffee.  Add some Vanilla Coffeemate and it is HEAVEN.  A great start to my day.  I brew it into a disposable cup and my commute becomes 100% more enjoyable."
"A couple of years ago I discovered Seattle's Best French Roast ground coffee, which was delicious and a good value, as a 3-pack of 12 oz bags from Amazon was only $18.  This quickly became my daily coffee fix.  Recently, however, the original packaging changed (I understand the company was bought by Starbucks), and so did the coffee.  Now called Level 5, the coffee seems OK when brewed immediately after opening the bag, but beginning the next day or so after opening, a freshly brewed batch tastes burnt and has an odd chemical flavor.  Like another reviewer, I cleaned my pot and tried a different coffee maker (one at work), but the coffee still tastes bad. I have now tried all three bags from my last order, and each makes the same unpleasant coffee.  To compound this disppointing change in coffee quality, the price on Amazon has gone up from $18 (with free shipping via Amazon Prime) to $41.95 + shipping costs for a 3-pack from an outside supplier.  Amazon and Seattle's Best have both lost my business on this one."
These are a great training aid for dogs because they seem to like them so much.  I have one dog but have offered them to others as well when I go to the dog park.  I have had great luck using these for rewards when she follows the commands.
"I got this for my husband who uses one of the old bar soaps known for leaving a ""sticky soap film"" behind.  He is a man of habit though and wouldn't use it even when I reminded him of the great commercial they had for the super bowl.  So, I hid his soap and left him with either this or puppy shampoo for his morning bath.  That did the trick! Not only that but this stuff has a really nice, subtle masculine scent.  mmmmmmmmm, I LIKE this stuff!  He smells sexy but not until you get really, really close, so I don't have to worry about the girls at work ""sniffing after him"".<br /><br />In the interest of writing a good review I did some additional research and used it on myself in the shower:  This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  It does a good job of washing off sweat, dirt, grease, etc. without having to reapply.  After using it, I did not have dry or itchy skin and I felt clean and refreshed.  The scent was faint and kinda woodsy, it reminded me of sandlewood but very subtle.  While this product is for men, I would use it again. As for my husband, I hope he keeps using this -- did I mention? -- mmmm I LOVE the smell of this on him."
"I feed my two dogs organic food, so it makes sense to serve them organic snacks. My dogs love these heart shaped, peanut butter biscuits.  I want to give my cherished pets only the best and hope they live a long life; therefore Newman's Own Dog Treats provides them with their nightly snack.  For smaller dogs, these biscuits can easily be broken in half."
"I initially received the incorrect item when I ordered this.  The company was very prompt to send out a replacement with the correct item.  I would use no other vanilla, it is GREAT!"
"It's a good product, and yes, it is organic, but still much overpriced in my opinion. Bottles are small - only 12 ounces and taste is good but nothing special. You can buy other organic honeys out there for less."
This decaf coffee is delicious and the price was super and the delivery was very fast.  I will order from them when my current supply is running low.  Thanks!
"I take care of five cats and I give them a flea treatment every month, so none of the cats had fleas on them (and they're all inside cats.)  When I noticed the floor of a bathroom had fleas, I purchased these traps.  Within an hour of putting them out, they were covered with fleas, even though there were no fleas anywhere else in the house (where I also placed traps).  This really gives me peace of mind because I want the cats to be comfortable and healthy, so I'll always put these traps out; if no fleas are ever discovered, then I'll know I'm doing my job."
i love this convenient instant coffee premixed with cream and sugar - it's rich flavor actually taste better than brewed coffee. i also enjoy the Nescafe 3 in 1 Regular Instant Coffee 30 Sticks (600g) which is lighter tasting than the Vincafe. Both are good because having a little variety in life is good! I highly recommend both 3-in-1 instant coffees. Great for travel!
"I use this product mixed with chocolate or vanilla Soy Slender, which also has 30% calcium, 25% D, and 7 g fiber.  Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.<br /><br />And I will be happy to answer M ""M"" about why.  This is four (4) canisters so it's not that expensive.  The other reason, besides it is good, is that those grocery stores you speak of don't have it. It has become very hard to find.  I can't find it at all any longer and am very happy to order a supply at Amazon."
These are the best snacks ever.  I am hooked and so are anyone who tries them.  YUM
great product - shipped quickly.  Coin operated feature wasn't too tough to disable.  The jelly bean fans in my family are delighted!
"This was a better deal than I could find anywhere else. Thanks, Amazon. My cat loves them and they make a good treat."
"I absolutely love Annie's gummies, they healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only reason I gave this particular flavor a 4 instead of 5 stars, is it just doesn't taste as good to me as any of the other Annie's flavors. This particular flavor in my opinion was okay, but no where near as good as some other Annie's flavors. I recommend trying the Summer Strawberry and the Berry Patch flavors as well!!<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices! The Mott's ones are also not organic, and not quite as soft as the Ocean Spray or Annie's, but again, much less expensive."
If you love cinnamon rolls and cannot have sugar this is it.  Has great texture and flavor. A must have for dieters.
"The jelly beans are absolutely fantastic. I was set people up and ask if they want so, well of course they do. It's so funny when they respond by spiting it out and say ""That taste like moldy cheese."" I crack up:^D hehehehehe!!! I recommend these jelly beans to everyone. I really wish they would come out with a poop flavor. I heard they have owl's poop. However, I never seen it."
"It is a medium roast pleasant coffee, comparable to green mountain's breakfast blend. I bought it with a very good deal though."
"****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br />****"
"Unfortunately the batch of Sumac I received had very little flavor to it at all. I expected it to have it's usual fresh, potent citrus flavor and instead it's mostly bland. I've added more than three times the usual dose to my dishes and I can still barely taste it."
"I normally HATE fake chips.  I don't even really like real chips, but if I'm having a chip, I don't want any of those taro, cassava whatevertheheck kind of chips.  They border on disgusting.  I was tentative to try these when I got them.<br /><br />I was surprised.  These chips are thick, airy and wonderful.  The BBQ flavor is the closest I've had to ""real"" BBQ chips.  I could eat a whole bag.<br /><br />I wouldn't call them a healthy snack, but they are more healthy than regular chips and quite enjoyable.  I can't believe I like a fake chip!"
"This is Good Coffee.  One of the best t-discs we have found.  It also makes for good iced coffee too.  Good medium coffee, not to harsh but not wimpy either."
"My yellow lab, who loves any and all food, does not like these! I get them out and she doesn't come running, so that's the perfect indication. I pull out some other snacks to lure her into her crate and she bounds in - but not with these!"
There may be a need to start a 12-step program for this coffee.  :)<br /><br />I do not usually like flavored coffees but I am so glad that I tried this one.
"Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water."
"i love amazon, and i love these bars! but ordering off of the internet is NOT the way to go on these and i should have listened to the other reviews..in this case, you get what you pay for..i but these religiously at multiple stores locally and they are always soft and fresh..as other reviewers mentioned, ordering from amazon, they come in hard as rocks! inedible and when i went to return them, they say you cant!!!!!! i will be contacting my cc company as i paid $40 some dollars for stale food..will NOT be ordering these again..VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
This peppermint mocha by Tassimo is excellent.  It is very flavorful and perfect for the holidays. Definitely one of their better products and a nice change from a regular latte or coffe drink.
"I was not aware of and was not told the country of origin when I purchased a case of Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food..  This product is made in Uruguay not the USA!! It made both of my dogs sick with severe diarrhea.  Blue Buffalo was out of stock so I thought ""Newman's Own"" indicated it would be a good product made in the USA.  WRONG!!!"
"My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.  Except the super active, petite 7lb 4oz tortie grew to just over ten pounds, waddled when she walked, because she was horribly obese, and slept 24 hours a day, waking up only to eat, and her coat was staritng ot lose it's shine.  That scared the hell out of me!  So I switched back to Hills.  With a week, she was starting to show interest in toys again, and was already starting to lose that swaying flabby fat belly.  Now she's back down to 7lb 7oz, and very active, healthy, and happy.  I will NEVER switch her food again!"
"As many others have noted, these treats made our dog extremely ill. We could not figure out what was wrong at first. Eventually we realized the treats might be making him sick. We stopped feeding him happy hips and he almost immediately got better. We threw them out. Stay very far away from this product."
"Tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run...unbelievably awesome. Tasted great, no stomach issues, no sticking to my teeth, water not required to ""wash it down"" and most importantly - it was the best run I've had in a long time. Can't wait to try other flavors."
"I'm not too sure about some of the negative reviews.  This is a good, basic, beef jerky.  Thicker than some, but good tender strips of meat.  Not hard to chew at all, good taste and an overall solid value.  Definitely beats some of the brands available at your local grocery."
"I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey."
"Let's face it.  If you drink any sort of Crystal Light product and expect it to taste as good as the real deal, then you've probably set your expectations too high.  Crystal Light's Mocktail Margarita mix is and comes across as exactly what it is . . . a mix.  Tastes incomplete on it's own, but does a serviceable job when mixed with alcohol.  Not horrible, not great, but squarely in between.  A compact way to keep a decent mix around.  Best used if you're desperate to sling a lot of drinks inexpensively or as a gateway mix for college kids (or both)."
"I bought this coffee by accident. (I never would have paid $40 for a single pound of coffee! I thought it was 3 pounds.) It's awesome. I'll probably only buy it for the holidays or special occasions, but note that I said I would buy it again!"
My baby really enjoys these.  They are her first real solid food and they dissolve really easily in the mouth even if she takes a bigger bite.  She is going through them really quickly because she likes them so much.
I have been buying Lucky Country Licorice for about a year now. When I quit smoking it helped to have some to chew on. Great flavor and texture. The strawberry is impossible to find in the stores around here so was real excited to find it at amazon.com.
"We have two pugs, a nine year old and a four year old.  Both have arthritis on their back legs.  Our vet recommended glucosamine with MSM.  I tried the chewable tablets and that was a bust.  Both dogs hated them.  Then I did an Amazon search and discovered this liquid formula.  The dogs LOVE it.  Along with the ease of use, neither dog has had any trouble with their legs since I started using this product.  If you have an arthritic pet, you should give Liquid Health K-9 a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed."
"I am not going to review why Xylitol is great or beneficial. I am not going to comment on the effects of chewing gum to reduce cavities, lose weight, catch the eye of the person on the subway you are attracted to, or eliminate planters warts on the bottoms of your feet. I will not go into the wonders of this gum, and how I keep packs in my desk at work, in my car, and under my pillow for those late night cravings.<br /><br />However, I will state that this is a great price to pay for twenty packs of this gum. In the stores, this gum runs about $2 a pack. The price I paid through Amazon is less than 75 cents per pack. I no longer have to feel guilty when I take that second piece because sometimes one piece just isn't enough.<br /><br />This is a great, guilt free, chemical free, wonderful tasting and long lasting gum. If there were just some way to harness the power from gum chewers' jaws into a clean energy..."
"I thought I'd finally write a review for others, since I keep coming back to buy this again and again. This black and green chai is my go-to tea, and I enjoy at least a cup or two every single day. I'm happy that Amazon offers it, so every couple of months I can replenish my stash conveniently and inexpensively. My favorite way to drink this tea is piping hot with a generous dollop of local honey. Enjoy!"
"I use these in a compost pail in my kitchen. They make it a little more convenient to empty the pail into the compost pile outside, but they are not leak proof so I am still faced with a messy pail nearly every time.  The bags do break down in the outdoor pile, but not quickly.  When I turn the pile, the kitchen scraps from the bags will have been broken down and converted into compost, but the ragged bags are still recognizable.  I have been using them for a year, and will have to screen bag fragments out of finished compost."
"I love these crackers they are very cheesy, in a good way, and they are easy to eat.  The best way I found to eat these is to get a small bowl of raspberry applesauce and start dipping.<br />Delicious!"
"I'm sorry but my wife and I found this product to be completely unpalatable.  I have tasted fresh coconut meat and canned coconut milk, but this is something totally different.  I suspect that it is an acquired taste. Before you buy a large quantity, be sure and know what it tastes like."
"I place a couple spoons of organic coffee plus organic soy milk, bring it to boil and then enjoy my coffee. My place is full of coffee aroma using soymilk and can even smell the coffee after I return to my place few hours later. Soyilk is very time consuming to make, so not my gig. SILK soy milk was the first SM that I tried few years ago and it was the worst soy milk I ever tried. Watery, awful tasting. Furthermore SILK did not sell organic soy milk. I even tried to contact SILK to find out if their soy was a GM , they would not respond. Sweeteners are added to all Plain soy milk to change the bitter taste of soy but vanilla does not since vanilla is a sweetener itself so calories are the same but vanilla tastes better. I even tried my coffee with almond milk, whole organic milk, etc. and none comes close to the taste of soy milk."
"I'm a daily cereal consumer. My wife is a health fanatic so I eat mainly organic cereal with very little sugar and as little refinement as possible. So that being said it was a treat to be able to try Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal. With 10g of sugar per 3/4 cup serving it is quite a bit sweeter then I'm used to. (Compare with Kellogg's Fruit Loops at 12g of sugar per 1 cup serving). Although it looks like Cheerios with nuts on it, it is not - the texture is heavier and crunchier and the taste is completely different. The nuts add a nice touch even though it would probably taste great without them. The vitamin content is quite high which means they probably fortified the cereal although I see nothing on the box that states this.<br /><br />As I said I enjoyed trying this cereal but knowing my wife (bless her heart) she won't be buying this cereal for me any time soon. I'll be sticking to the healthier varieties but at least I know I'm cared for."
"Delicious.  Unlike the other reviewer, I had no problems with it's dissolving capabilities.  It's now unavailble. I sure hope Amazon gets it back in stock soon.  I only have 2 cans left.  I wanted to get the subscription to it.<br /><br />You can't go wrong.  The powder was fresher, noticeable by the fact that the texture was finer and less clumpy than what I've bought locally.<br /><br />Bring it back, Amazon, Please!!"
"Ya for 10% juice rockstar......NOT<br /><br />I just had one of these new 10% juice version and they taste like crap, WTF is wrong with rockstar why change something that was so good to something that tastes like crap now..... goodbye my beloved 50% juice untill you return (if ever) I shall miss you. oh and circulation just hit my area with this crap."
"Yuck! This has to be one of the worst tasting teas ever. I actually really like the other Stash Tea flavors so I'm surprised this one tastes pretty disgusting. It tastes like benadryl or something. It definitely doesn't taste like vanilla or chai. I don't know why it even tastes the way it tastes. I even sweetened my tea with molasses to sweeten it, and it didn't even mask the taste very well. Word of advice try any other tea flavors from Stash but this."
"My chihuahua puppy did so well on this food, but then I could not find it anymore. I tried a new food, but she had diarrhea and bloody mucous. Finally I put her on the Avoderm Small Breed Adult food as the formulation is a lot like the small breed puppy version, except with a little less protein. My puppy is 8 months old now so I figured it was okay. Now she is thriving again -- nicely formed stool, very silky coat that is luxurious to touch, and lots and lots of cheerful energy. I am not kidding. I hate paying a premium price and having to go way out of my way to buy Avoderm, but my dog does so well on it that I am going to keep her on it. How much can a 3 pound dog eat, anyway."
I have used this product for a number of years. I find it works to strengthen the sinus walls so that allergies are diminished. It also works well to help with colds.
"Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink."
"It's an amazing product-- there's nothing else like it around- and I've looked! I grew up in Nebraska and since moving away from the Midwest, I've yet to find it again. I only get it when I go home.<br /><br />It's available through dorothy lynch direct, but it's about $12 a bottle. I really wish it was available here to give some price competition."
I love these Garden of Eatin Baked Blue Corn Tortilla Chips.  Blue corn is a nutritional powerhouse full of anti-oxidants and higher in protein than either white or yellow corn.<br /><br />These are tasty and low in sodium and low in fat because they are baked!
"Quinoa is not only a fantastic whole grain and complete protein, it is delicious.  For those who love cereal, but are unable to eat wheat gluten, this is perfect.  The order arrived as requested, on time.  The packaging is minimal, which is a big plus for the environment and another indication of the attention to detail.  The bags are remarkable durable and the grain is fresh and wonderfully aromatic.  It has many uses and is good sweet and salty, spicy and even plain.  It is hard to find a multi purpose grain with no drawbacks I am aware of at least.  All good!"
"Flavor names vs flavor photos are pretty confusing. I ordered ""Rich Chocolate"" and received ""Rich Milk Chocolate"". Now that I tasted it it's fine and I realize it's very possible that Nestle stopped making Rich Choc and started these Rich Milk / Rich Dark items, but Amazon should really fix the flavor names so that it's clear what you're getting."
"Haven't bought yet - can't determine number of oz.  It's on the jar, but I can't read it - can't find it in the description."
"Package arrived very quickly and product was as advertised. I love this rice, it's easy and quick to make and it taste good!"
"I got the chance to try a sample of Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea as a BzzAgent.  I love iced tea and Keurig, but I usually like a less sweet tea, so I have to admit to being skeptical when I popped that Celestial Seasonings Southern Sweet Tea K-Cup into my Keurig.  I needn't have worried!  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the iced tea this brews.  I used the 6 oz setting to get a stronger tea flavor, and this K-Cup delivered exactly that.  It has a nice strong black tea flavor, and it is lightly sweet, not at all overpoweringly sweet like I was expecting.  Pop a slice of lemon in there and you've got the perfect glass of sweet iced tea in less than a minute!"
"m, my daughter, my mother, my friends, all loveeeee these.... better than any bakery!! perfect homemade..... cant wait to get a big box of them!"
"Love this salt!!!  I had no idea what a difference it had been making in our dishes until I ran out of it and had to use some regular salt that we had around the house!  We said to each other....""Hmmmmm....the food tastes so bland!  Is it my tast buds?  I missed it somewhere when I cooked this!""<br /><br />We cooked a few more meals and the same!  When we finally got the Himalayan salt in from Amazon, the next meal we cooked was delicious again!!!  So, we learned that this salt really makes a huge difference in the flavor of our dishes!!  Who needs flavor enhancers when you have this?"
"I'll get this out of the way first... If you are expecting the quality of a few tenths of an ounce of instant ""mix"" to be the same as a fresh pressed glass of Apple Cider, you're expectations are way too high for a product like this. This is a fancy instant drink mix in a K-Cup package.<br /><br />Just got my first package and made my first cup and it is pretty darn good. I paid $8.50 with the subscribe and save discount and for 24 K-Cups (around 35 cents each), I think it is a pretty good deal.<br /><br />You can taste the sometimes over-sweetness of the fake sugar used (heck, they only have 10 calories, there has to be a trade off!) but I regularly use Splenda in my coffee so it was not a problem.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alternative to coffee or tea in your Keurig brewer, this is a pretty good option and a pretty good price."
"i'M A COFFEE lOVER<br />this product is very good<br />the vanila Flavors are one of my favorite.<br />My friend send to me on my birthday, and I had to<br />give a 5 star on this product.thanks."
"OK, who else has a stash of Taco Bell sauces in their fridge?  Just me?  Wow, I hope not.  You people are just too embarrassed to admit it.  :)  Well, as a former college student, I have learned to love Taco Bell, mostly for their cheapy ""Mexican"" food.  But it turns out they can make some nummy sauces, too!  We had this on burritos (homemade!) the other night, and it really tastes good!  And looking at the nutrition info explains it all.  Two tablespoons has 11 grams of fat and 300 milligrams of sodium.  And somehow 4% of the daily value for vitamin A snuck in there.<br /><br />This has a little bit of a bite, but it's not spicy.  There is a good smoked chipotle flavor to it.  I really like it and would buy more.  But in the interest of my blood pressure, maybe not all the time."
"Coconut oil is sensitive to light and can break down easily, so it should be packaged in a dark container (way to go Barlean's).  Also, to keep it as nutritionally rich as possible, it should be cold-pressed and Barlean's is indeed cold-pressed.  I have had flavorless and dry coconut oils, so this coconut oil delighted me--smells divine and has a lovely consistency.  Coconut oil is amazing, it can be used for cooking (it is the most stable--healthy--oil at high temperatures), baking etc. and it is excellent for your skin and your hair!  I keep a jar in my kitchen and one in my bathroom!"
"I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well."
"This product does not taste to green tea at all, this is no surprising if you look at the ingredients: it has green tea, lemongrass, apple pomace, blackberry leaves, malic acid, lemon peel, natural lemon flavor wonf, citric acid, roasted chicory root, rosehip and lemon juice.<br /><br />The taste is not bad, but is not tea and it should not be sold as tea in my opinion. I will not buy it again."
"I'm a coffee drinker that prefers to grind my own beans because it is fresher that way. The more recently it was roasted the better. I like dark, hearty coffees, but not ones that have been over-roasted. A select few ground coffees can be good, and this is one of them. Melitta strikes a nice balance between the light and dark roasts. The dark roast predominates but the light roast helps make it smooth and flavorful. This is a fine grind and makes a more potent pot of coffee than similar amounts of your standard ground coffees like Foldgers or Maxwell House.<br /><br />They've priced this mid-range coffee competitively and I would recommend it to people who appreciate a flavorful, aromatic coffee. It cannot replace just roasted and freshly ground coffee, but you'd be hard pressed to find something much better outside of a gourmet shop. I've used Melitta's filters for years, and now I'm enjoying their coffees as well. Because of the Blanc et Noir Ground blend, I tried their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GTO"">Colombian Medium Roast</a> and found it to be quite good as well."
It is a must for all green tea ice-cream lovers.  I wish I could buy them in the US but  I am glad Amazon have them available from Japan.<br />the shipping took a long time but it was totally worth the wait. plus I got some free Japanese cakes and green tea candy  as well as a citrus kitkat bar. I also ordered raspberry kitkats and love them as well. ever since a friend  let me taste these products - I got totally obsessed with them. i also recommend  KitKat - cheesecake .<br />I will buy again ! thanks !
"I have tried a couple flavors of this, Pomegranate is my favorite, and I think they work great! I have a busy 3 year old and work full time, so there are times I need an extra boost.  I have tried other energy drinks and always feel anxious and jittery.  I didn't get that with 5 Hour Energy.  I felt a noticeable boost in energy about 10 minutes after drinking it and it tapered off throughout the day, I never had the crash I was expecting. I wouldn't use these everyday, but for when you need the extra boost, it's perfect!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"I'm a gal who LOVES her sweets - and I had one of these babies just early today HOLLA!!  Twix hit a grane slam with this addition to the Twix family.  I remember when the two varieties of Twix were the original caramel and the peanut butter - both featuring the same kind of regular cookie base.<br /><br />That was then and this is now!  These aren't your fathers peanut butter Twix.  With the new kind, you'll find a chocolate cookie base, and the difference is truly impressive.  This is uniquely different Twix flavor - and the spookiest chick around recommends them like nobody's business.  Just don't overdo it or you'll be passing gas more than usual."
"This brought me back to my childhood. My dad would always take us kids to the grocery store and buy us each a squeeze pop! There were so good and so easy to eat. My mom would be so upset that he bought them for us because they were also so sticky and boy did we make things sticky. I was so excited when i purchases these because while they do still sell squeeze pops in the stores, they only sell the sour variety now and it's just not the same. I don't like the sour ones, i'd wander through the aisles hoping that just maybe they would be stocked with the original version, but to no avail. I am very pleased that I now know where I can get some! :D"
We love these crackers for our salmon spread.  They have just the right flavor and crispness to enjoy the taste of the spread.  And they're healthy!
"yeah just basically good by themselves, my wife puts salsa or peanut butter or other toppings, I like them just the way they are eat 2 or 3 and satisfy my hunger for something more fattening."
I TAKE THIS ON KAYAKING TRIPS INTO THE FLORIDA KEYS BACK COUNTRY.KEEPS WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.EXCELLENT FOR BACKPACKING AND AS AN EMERGENCY STORE!VERY TASTY!
"I ordered these candies for the first time and I am hooked, they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming. I really enjoy them. Highly recommended! Unique candy!"
"These were great. my bf talked about these a few times and so when I saw them on Amazon for such a great price for a ton, I got them! He loved them, but got sick on them after a while. Snickers is the best, then M&M's, then the rest (at least that's what we both thought). Delicious, but if you eat them everyday you will be sick of them by the end. Great deal!"
"I read the instructions five times in order to ""set"" the traps. I still couldn't ""get-it"". So, I put the thing in my vise. I studied the trigger mechanisim and the ""light"" went on. I have not set the traps up yet because the moles seem to have disappeared after I put grub killer on the lawn."
"Got this STRICTLY as a gift for my ""Elvis"" brother-in-law.<br />The entire order smelled like the most wonderful stuff in the world!<br />My will was too weak!  HAD to do ""quality control""........<br />ONLY con..........can is way too small !<br />Best cocoa ever........add marshmallows.......(sigh).....put up the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign.<br />Empty tin makes a great little bank.<br />Jelly Belly's  make a great gift.<br />ELVIS FANS UNITE!!  You won't be sorry you purchased this!"
"dogs love them but cheaper at Walgreens, 24 pack is $10. I microwave them in water for 1 minute on high and let them soak for 10 minutes to soften them. The dogs like them better that way."
This purchase was a great deal in terms of price and product.  Love green tea and it is so healthy for you.
"I sent these as gifts to mom and grandmother.  My mother called to tell me what was in the basket and how late it was received.  She told me that she felt bad, but wanted me to know considering what was paid.  The items were tasty though, according to her.  The items seemed shorted as to what was pictured.  I've ordered baskets before, from two other companies on Amazon, and got much better reviews from the recipients, including mom.  Broadway seems much better."
We used to have drive down to the specialty pet food store for this product.  So glad we discovered Amazon.  As far as I can tell it is no more expensive & in some cases less - Prime membership is awesome.  Loving Pets treats are some of the best according to my dog.  They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.
"This has quickly become one of my favorite teas. It is flavorful without being overpowering. I love that it is a black tea as well. It is a good quality black tea complimented by the sweet taste of blueberries, which you can actually taste. The aroma is fantastic as well. I drink it with honey, which really brings the flavor to life."
This tea is warm and spicy. The coconut is not overwhelming. It's my favorite tea
"I have been wanting to try this for a while but have put it off thinking that it might have an artificial taste or that the blueberry is just a little weird with coffee.  But WOW was I wrong.<br /><br />This coffee is absolutely delicious!!  I love it with a splash of vanilla coffee-mate in it.  It has a sweetness to it, with a hint of blueberry with a really perfect blend of coffee that isn't too strong or too weak.  It's just right!  Kind of reminds me of a blueberry muffin or blueberry waffle or something - but without it having an over powerful blueberry taste.<br /><br />With the fall weather it has been an excellent morning choice, along with the perfectly pumpkin <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHGP72"">Timothy's World Coffee Perfectly Pumpkin, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> which also very tasty!  Love the fall/winter weather to experiment with these flavors!  Go ahead and try it, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was!"
"These are full of nuts.  Great flavor.  Sweet due to the fruit, but the nuts keep it under control."
"We researched dog foods and found many to have fillers and things we didn't want our beloved Westie to eat!  Orijen is a fresh, healthy food.  Our vet strongly approves of Orijen and our Westie loves it!  She had skin allergies and this has Omega 3's, fresh fish, good quality protein, minimal fat, no fillers or junk.  Her skin itching is gone!"
"I'm not a coffee ""gourmet"", so my review is quite simple. I've tried dozens of K-Cup varieties, and, this is the best ever.  I like strong coffee, but, sometimes the bold varieties are somewhat bitter.  This one is strong yet smooth and has a very pleasant aroma as well.  My very favorite!  Would like to see this one on autoship!"
"After I brought these home for the first time, my husband was hooked! I love how the flavor is not overwhelming and they are a one handed snack. My husband loves the flavor and was excited to see that you can find many different flavors available in our local grocery store. Even my toddler daughter is a fan and thinks they are a treat. :)"
"Not sure why these are labled ""banana"" because they have ZERO flavor of any kind.  Taste like dry cardboard!  Even cheerios have a ""taste.""  My 10 month old loves puffs but spits these out.  Tried mixing them in a bowl with another brand of banana puffs and these still always get spit out.  Guess they are going in the trash.  SO glad I didn't order a 6pk of these!"
"When I couldn't find this product, I used other Rose Food producst. Not one worked as well as this one. I finally found this online and my ROSES ARE HAPPY!"
"I love the gummies. They are sweet, fresh, and natural. I kind of wish that they were as good as the Farleys brand and maybe some other brands."
"This is very good corn chowder with a strong garlic base. It is a little salty for my taste and seems to have a touch more rosemary than I prefer but overall very good for a dried soup mix. It is not quite as good as ""Bear Creek Chunky Potato Soup Mix"" that I used to buy and add corn to myself to make corn chowder, but I can't find that particular soup anymore. You must add your own fresh chopped onion, garlic, bacon, chicken broth and milk to make the soup so it is not quite as complete as some of the other dried soup mixes on the market. I would buy this product again."
"A friend told me about the Pop Chips and how great they were, so I ordered a case of 3 different flavors to share at the office.  With only 100 calories per bag, they make a great mid-afternoon snack!"
These arrived today.  They are stale and chewy.  There is practically no flavor.  I am soooo disappointed!
"I love wasabi peas and have ordered different brands and have bought every type imaginable off the grocery store shelves.  The peas from JR Mushrooms & Specialties are the best I've had to date.<br /><br />I like my wasabi peas to have a little kick, so if you like them that way too these are the peas to get. The shipping was fast as well.  I even ordered some when I was in Afghanistan and they were delivered quickly and in perfect condition.<br /><br />As far as price goes, you can't beat it.  I usually order the 5 lbs of peas and it comes in either 1 large or 2 medium sized zip lock bags so you can take what you want and seal it up for later use."
All of The Pure Pantry mixes are fabulous.  Gluten free doesn't mean taste free!  This baking mix allows me to make all kinds of breads and muffins I can also use it as flour when I roll out dough.  I only buy Pure Pantry mixes now.
"I add these nibs to smoothies and yogurts.  Everyone in my family enjoys this product, including my 15 month old son.  However, cacao nibs are not at all sweet, and I would not consider them candy."
"This was not bad at all. It had a sugary black cherry taste but overall, not bad. There is a slight bitter after taste. It's a nice alternative to soda, although an 8.3 ounce can of Back Cherry Switch has 30g of sugar. It's not thick but the sweetness does hit you! One thing that raises my eyebrow (besides the after-taste) was the price of the case. A 24 pack of cans that are slightly smaller than a can of soda for $24 is a little on the high side. Consider a 12 pack of Pepsi (or if you like Coke) which is roughly about $5.99 per pack. If you get 2 packs, you're only paying $12, but if you get a 24 pack of Switch, then your paying over $20 (for smaller cans than)."
"We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat."
I enjoy the mild coffee blends that Green Mountain has.  Great price and fast shipping.
"I tried this from the sampler pack and couldn't get over how great it tasted when brewed at the largest (travel mug) setting in the Platinum brewer. Although I like the Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain for my actual breakfast cup of coffee, this is the one that is keeping me out of Starbucks!"
"This product is really good for you healthy wise. But if you cant swallow it, its a waste of fricken money!! it tastes like a tangy spoiled milk to me. I bought this for my sister. She and I have heard its really good for you and did the research to follow it up. I know not everything good for you tastes/smells pleasant, so you just put it down the hatch because you know its what your body needs to run at a optimal level. But I cant do it with this. And Ive drank all sorts of nasty smelling health stuff. I just cant get over the connection to spoiling milk. My sister is drinking the rest of our package. But Ive noticed that shes been drinking hers with lots of ice and she doesnt do it every day because its so awful. We will not be buying this again. I hope this helps some of the customers looking at this product (even if my opinion is of the miniority)."
"Wonderful color I don't know what to say extremely fast delivery. I was surprised how many were really in container. I personally did not like the flavor and couldn't find any of my kids who did. To their credit they did taste like ""juicy pear"" but for me they left a bad after taste in my mouth."
"First time ordering this stuff, and it shows up ... hard as a rock. This is ridiculous seeing as how it's supposed to be in POWDER FORM for crying out loud. What the hell is wrong with Amazon for even SHIPPING this stuff in this manner? Are their shipping dept. personnel completely braindead NOT to notice that this bag of powdered peanut butter should not be hard as a brick?? And from other reviews, Amazon won't accept returns on this item? That is outrageous. Bad Amazon, just BAD!<br /><br />I'm gonna TRY ordering the jarred version, and I freaking hope it shows up as it's intended; in POWDERED FORM dammit :/."
"I eat hot cereal every morning for breakfast, so I'm picky. This is a perfect one. High in fiber, quick cooking, delicious, good texture, INEXPENSIVE, and you can get it delivered in packs of 6!?!!? I cannot be happier."
Our dog loves this toy and so does our vet. He can't believe how clean our dog's teeth are because of this toy.
Green Mountain is one of my favorite coffee brands.  Breakfast blend is mellow and a great way to start your day.
"Any time you order (even when reading previews) it is a gamble.  Nearly all of the previews for this were good, but I read one which was not and called the validity of all the other previews into question.  I was concerned, but ordered any way.  I am glad I did.  These cherries were sweet, moist, and had that amazing cherry flavor that you usually only find in long cooked cherries.  They were well packaged and delicious.  If I need cherries again, I will definitely buy these."
"This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference. Add a little honey and its delicious. Had neighbors try it and they fell in love, drank my whole stash. One of my spouse's favorites, even I enjoy it and I'm a coffee drinker!"
Our dogs love the Everlasting Vanilla Mint!  One dog will licks and the other dog chews but it takes them a long time to finish them when they are in the treat balls.  The treat ball has provided them with hours of entertainment this winter when we haven't been able to get out much.  We have tried the Chicken and Liver flavors as well but the vanilla mint is by far the favorite.
"These Anchos are fantastic. Ancho is actually ripe smoked and dried poblano peppers.<br />Similar to how a chipolte is smoked and dried red jalapeno.<br /><br />These chiles have a mild to medium heat with a sweet fruity flavor with hints of cherry,<br />fig, and mild tabasco peppers. It's a favorite in Mexican cooking, and especially in mole,<br />but it has a wide range of uses from sauces to salsas and even steak and barbecue sauce.<br />This stuff is also a critical ingredient in the best enchilada sauces.<br /><br />These Badia peppers are properly sun-dried and not the variety of oven dried peppers more<br />commonly found that makes the peppers somewhat bitter. You can use these right out of the<br />bag by crushing or grinding, or you could toast them in oil to really bring out their flavor.<br />Most people just reconstitute them in water and puree them for sauces. At any rate, this is<br />one of the most useful and flavorful ingredients for a variety of dishes than you are likely<br />to find anywhere. 5 Pods"
"My toy poodle is 4 years old and he is pretty smart. He loves learning new tricks and seems to enjoy being challenged mentally. This product is great for him because he loves playing with tennis balls. Basically, this ""toy"" is really a puzzle for him to try to get the tennis ball out. It helps that my dog has small paws which can easily get inside the toy. Another benefit is the rubber is soft and is easily washable. It is particularly challenging for him to get the tennis ball"
"We had the Green Chile Habanero one at a local restaurant and we loved it so much and decided to buy our own.<br />Was very excited to see Amazon has it as a gift pack, so we get to try all 4 flavors.<br />It's definitely spicy comparing to other regular hot sauce you can purchased at grocery stores."
The dogs love this  treat!  They will do almost anything for the delicious treat!<br />The freeze dried chicken liver treats are more tempting than the beef.  These<br />treats are better than any we've tried for our dogs.  Yum Yum!!
"For some you will have to aquire a taste for the way these olives are cured. If you are willing to try it and hang in there it is well worth it though. These have already been prepared for you but you can still add your own olive oil and any other spices you may like to them. The flesh of these olives after being cured is meaty with a slight bitter to them. They play off the almonds very well. The almonds in this mixture are soft, smooth (almost creamy) and offset the slight bitter in the olive. I prefer to eat one or two olives and then follow up with an almond. You can even eat both simultaneously. The olives do have pits so be careful. Don't just bite down into one or you may damage a tooth. Eat the flesh of the olive off of the pit. I prefer to add some of my own extra virgin olive oil but it is up to your individual taste. This would go great on an antipasta tray or served with some cheeses and maybe some wine. Buon Appetito!"
"Both entrees were popular at my house, with all my furkids except ""Mr. Picky!""  This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like ""people food,"" as the box says.  If you're concerned about issues such as ""gluten free,"" it's that, too.<br /><br />I did feel that the ""Chicken Pot Pie Entree"" had a lot of liquid in proportion to the amount of solids, especially for the price.  About half the can is broth.  Kitties who prefer minced meals would probably not like this."
"Let me start out by saying how sad I am to give this product a negative review.  I love watermelon EVERYTHING, so I was super excited when I saw this new syrup was available.  I have to say, however, that it blows my mind how the guys in Amoretti R&D actually thought this syrup tasted like anything but watermelon cough syrup.  For use in Italian sodas, this is *completely* undrinkable.  I've confirmed this with a few friends to make sure I wasn't just being a bitch.  Others reviewers here have mentioned using this syrup in yogurt, and I did try a couple pumps in a strawberry smoothie, and the dairy did seem to help cover up the poison/medicinal overtones.<br />  In short, I cannot recommend this flavor.  If you're looking for a good watermelon syrup, try the Torani version.  I'm sure Amoretti has some excellent flavors in their arsenal, but this is definitely NOT one of them."
"Happy with Dog Food, and our dogs like it too!  The food is made of healthy ingredients and is especially good for one dog of ours who has skin allergies, and there are many ingredients he can't tolerate.  I've found the 26 lb. bag to be the best price.<br /> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SUVR5W"">Wellness Simple Solutions Dog Food, Rice and Salmon Formula, 10-Pound and 8-Ounce Bag</a>"
"Chocolate deserves four stars just because.<br />Beyond that, I thought these were tasty but they fell apart like crumbly cake.  Taste was good, but the presentation was not so much."
"These are stunningly delicious.  If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave (or take them along on a hot summer day's picnic), they're soft and chewy and addictive."
"I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten-free diet.  They taste great!  I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them."
"Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner."
"I bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa, but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one.  The peppermint was pretty good as well...good cocoa!!!"
"Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds)."
"I bought these sky bars for my husband who was nostolgic about the old seven up bars. While they don't have all the flavors inclued in those, the flavors in this bar are delicious! It's like getting 4 kinds of chocolate bar in one."
"I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger. I give this k-cup an A+!"
"I was just deceived... I'm pregnant and have a craving for caviar, but can't eat any raw fish products. So the only option for me is pasteurized caviar. The description of the product here states that this romanoff caviar is pasteurized, but when I got it I didn't find any mention about pasteurization on the jar or packing! So, I can't eat it. It's not cheap, but I don't want spent more money on return shipment, so don't know what to do with it...<br />Shame on you, seller, for deceiving your customers!"
My dogs love Zuke's Hip Action Treats.<br /><br />I don't know if you realized it or not but the individual bags you were selling were cheaper than the three pack.
i have 5 rat terries and they love these things. they are good for them as they are mostly natural which is good due to i have one that can not have much crude fat. just have to shop around to see who has best prices as they can be expensive.
"If not careful, even a Christian like me could begin to think these truffles are the meaning of life! They are fabulous and have become one of my best friends, and I am blessed with lots of friends!  Seriously, you cannot do better than these amazing confections!"
Thought this was going to be multiple boxes as the pictures appears for this product and it was $15 for 5 small pouches!!  I pay less than $5/box at target but thought I was getting more than that size box here!  Never again!
"I have bought palm sugar before and love it in my coffee, tea and on fruit.  I was shocked to taste this product and find it contains salt!  I see that the packaging says ""fleur de sel"" but do not speak French, so that didn't mean a thing to me. I realize that if I had carefully read the entire ad and not only the ""Product Features"", I would have seen that the ""Important Information"" and ""Product Description"" list salt as an ingredient.<br /><br />This is a great product; just be aware that ""fleur de sel"" means salt!"
"The price was cheap & so was the product. These rawhide bones literally disinegrated into a thousand small shards, occasionally causing my Golden to gag on them. I don't feel that i got my money's worth, because they would break up & be gone in 10 minutes, rather than giving hours of enjoyment. I had to vacuum the floor every time he had one. I bought better ones @ Costco. I give him these cheap, junk, ones, to have, only in the yard"
"Having used the Senseo Dark Roast pods for years, I was happy when Amazon got them back in stock.  But the coffee is now undrinkable--it is incredibly bitter; I ended up throwing it out.  To make sure it was not just me, I made a cup for a friend who LOVES the Dark Roast, and she also said that it was very bitter.<br /><br />Called Senseo.  The rep said that he had gotten other complaints of a similar nature: that the new blend was bitter.  He said that it might have been a problem at the factory, since the new batches were supposed to taste the same as the older batches.  (The former factory has closed down, and they are manufacturing the new batches in a different factory.)  However, the new bags also say ""French Roast' not just ""Dark Roast"" so this may account for the difference--but French roasted coffee should not be bitter.<br /><br />For those who are concerned that the pods no longer say ""Senseo"" on the top, they are not counterfeit.  I was told that Senseo decided to eliminate the printing, since it made the pod fractionally thicker and some customers had problems with the top of the pod tearing.  Removing the printing would hopefully do away with this problem.  However, this is the least of my worries, since these pods will have to be thrown out and I do not have any of the older Senseo Dark Roast pods remaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: The following day, having written the scathing review above, I decided to open another bag and see if those pods were as awful as those in the first bag before I threw out all remaining five bags of pods.<br /><br />To my surprise, these pods were fine and the coffee tasted just like the older version.  Clearly there is a problem in the production in the new factory.  I did not want to open the other four bags now, since they would lose their freshness, but it is still possible that the coffee in some of those is also horrible.  But at least I feel better knowing that Senseo did not change the formula for the Dark Roast.  Now they just have to get their production kinks worked out.<br /><br />Amazon, of course, was great in dealing with the problem."
"This product is alright. I LOVE the lentil couscous one. This one is a bit salty, just not as good as some of the other. But it is a great product on the fly."
"I and my wife were afraid to try canned food through amazon. The low number of comments made us unsure of buying this product. Today, we got them and they are very tasty. The cans were easy to open and were not messy if you opened them in the right way. I recommend you to buy them.<br />The only bad thing in this product, that it doesn't have some fish eggs."
We have ordered this product twice and the quality and freshness is always optimal.  We are always amazed at the quick delivery by Amazon.  Thank you!!  Steve and Debi Watson
"Risotto is never our favorite, but this is a wonderful change from our usual fare.  Plus it is Quick and easy and wonderful added to homemade soups and stew.  I like adding veggies and cheddar overall if I serve it as a side dish.  Everything Lundberg is wonderful ... esp. their rice pasta noodles.  yum."
"This seasoning blend used to be carried in our local store, and then suddenly we couldn't find it ANYWHERE.  I'm so happy to be able to order it!  It's so much more than your regular, grocery-store mix of oregano, parsley, and other greenery.<br /><br />We use it in so many things.  Of course, it's great in our Italian dishes.  It's also livened up things such as sausage balls, spinach dip (SO GOOD), and even just oven-baked chicken.  I never thought I'd order spices online, and I never thought I'd be so happy to see a package arrive.  :)"
"I haven't yet tried the morels which are of course the gems of the litter, but of the three other varieties I've tried, these are great!  An ounce is quite a lot actually...I'm going to get 2-3 uses out of each bag.<br /><br />I've never rehydrated mushrooms before but it's pretty easy and has some great benefits.  While the texture isn't the same as cooking with fresh mushrooms it lets you have all these varieties any time of the year and the ""liquor"" that you get from the water they rehydrate in is flavorful and great for using in sauces (sometimes the same recipe as the mushrooms).<br /><br />One caveat though - I had looked up instructions online and then compared them with the labels.  I followed the instructions on the labels at first but found one important thing that the internet had suggested - you really do need to carefully wash these and strain the liquor if you're going to use it.  That's because there IS sand and grit on a few of the mushrooms.  (Overall they seem fairly clean, but I bit into a few grains of sand the first few times I used them because of skipping this step)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a FANTASTIC price and a great way to try these varieties if you never have since most aren't available in a lot of grocery stores.  My palate is inexperienced in most of these varieties but they seem good to me...nice big mushrooms that rehydrate well and are full of flavor.<br /><br />Finally, I did separately order a variety of other products from Earthy direct from their website.  They have a lot of stuff there (sauces, spices, gourmet treats) and their other products are fantastic thus far as well.  Watch prices though...although it's nice to get all your little treats in one place, some items really are cheaper here on Amazon.<br /><br />Customer service from Earthy is great as well...I would assume they'd treat Amazon orders as well as they treat their direct traffic.  I had an issue (my fault) with an order from their website and they were incredibly helpful fixing it."
"I really like the smoothness of this coffee- not acidic or bitter. It is neither dark nor light...a nice ""non-offensive"" middle of the road coffee to have on hand. I did get grounds in my coffee one time this week, but I am fairly new to Keurig and don't know if this is the occassional thing that I can expect, or if this was an isolated incident. Will keep my eyes open for it, but overall happy with this purchase. I plan on reordering."
"Good aroma, good mouth feel, but the taste...flavorless.  Like a crunchy lump of flour.  Might help if they put some ginger in it."
"This is the WORST TASTING Baby whole clams I have ever had!! Being a Bumble Bee Brand, I thought there is no way I could go wrong.. I love their tuna. I make clam chowder once or twice a month {cold weather} for family or friends.<br /><br />We had company coming that night. Thank goodness I tried it before they arrived. I ended up throwing it out!!<br />I e-mailed Amazon and told them the problem and wanted a credit to my account..Less than 30 minutes I received a e-mail from Amazon.<br /><br />Was informed that a credit would be giving. Will show on my account in two or three days, which it did. Told not to send the two cases back. Get rid of it anyway I wanted.. Our cats would not eat it, not the dog!!  I took it to the dump!!<br /><br />I could not believe the speed in how Amazon handled this problem!! I have NEVER dealt with a company that moved this fast!!!! I made a mistake ordering a dvd. E-mailed Amazon and it was taken care of with in a half-hour!!!<br /><br />I have NEVER received a dented can , nor crush package.. Also the boxes they send the items in , have saved me money from buying from the post office!!<br /><br />Needless to say I`m Very Happy dealing with Amazon!!"
Made the mistake of ordering this product. This coffee is WAY too coarse to use. The result is that the coffee tastes weak and bland. You have to use a TON of coffee to get any taste whatsoever and even then it doesn't taste very good. Now I'm stuck with 4 cans. I may try running the grounds through a coffee grinder to see if I can get a finer grind. Very disappointed.<br /><br />May try the black can (espresso grind) in the future as that one has excellent reviews.
I brought some of this back from a trip to Jamaica and wished I had bought it by the gallon.  It is very hard to find but WELL worth ordering in bulk!  It is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to Jamaica with every taste.  I have attempted to duplicate it many times but can't seem to get it right.  I am ecstatic to finally have found a source.
I love cappuccino from the gas station. It is sweet and a good pick me up. This tastes just like that! I love love love it. French vanilla and caramel yum yum yummy too. I highly recommend this item for those who love the sweet gas station cappuccinos. I like it sweet and creamy and that is what this is.
"I've decided to order this online due to uncomparable high price of maple syrup in local stores.  I'm glad that I did, besides saving money, it also tasted better.  Happy with this purchase."
I ordered dark cherries and I received gooseberries. Someone was not paying attention. My order conformation showed the cherries that I ordered.
"I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).""<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content."
"I had this tea at a friends house recently, and really enjoyed it.  I was delighted to find that it was available from Amazon, and immediately placed my order.  It came quickly, and was just as I'd hoped.  The tin keeps it very fresh, and I'm enjoying my delicious new tea - just in time for the holiday season!"
I love this water; placebo effect or truth to the Ph...sorry im a skeptic...this stuff makes me feel fantastic!! If Im going to drink a bottle of water I turn to this brand of alkaline water. :D
"I am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in CHINA. Treats from China have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs. Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description, ""read the label carefully"". In very small print the country of origin is disclosed. I do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from China.<br /><br />These are great treat. My dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers. However, at most other on line pet websites they are half the price. Usually Amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products."
"Very disappointed with the flavor, or lack therof.  Stash usually has dependable products, so this was a real letdown."
"This was a big disappointment to me.  I truly adore the Strawberry Tea and the Peach Tea from St. Dalfour and figured I'd have the same reaction to the Black Cherry Tea.  Sorry I bought so much of it, and I'm going to donate it somewhere, probably the food bank."
"You asked for my review of this purchase already, I said fast shipping and good product. Do not bother me with these reviews any more, if i have a problem i will let you know. I will stop using amozon in the future if you don't leave me alone."
"I play a lot of tennis in summer and do good amount of lifting when the weather gets colder. Turning 40 I started to notice that my recovery time gets longer, and I often still feel it the next day.  After doing some research on the Internet I decided to try protein + glutamine/creatine powder. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0XDI"">Optimum Nutrition Creatine Glutamine Taurine, Wild Berry, 1.32 Pound (Pack of 2)</a>) It really works. I drink 2 tea spoonful of each mixed with orange or mango (my favorite) juice after workout and always ready for more the next day.<br />It also ensures that I always have enough fiber in my diet.<br />I guess people complaining about taste of hemp protein tried mixing it with water - really bad idea. It's too grainy to stay suspended in water. Use thicker juice or milk."
"I typically drink my coffee as a latte (microwave a little skim milk, then use a frother), so the coffee is about 1/4 froth/milk. I also use a french press.<br /><br />The grind is a little fine for the french press - small pieces end up making it through the filter.<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is fine to me. The vanilla flavor is light. I don't love the coffee, but it's...OK. Not a ringing endorsement, but eh."
"Quite good tea, never had white tea before, so it took some getting used to. Not my favorite, but its not bad either."
"I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."
"Don't buy these from Amazon Warehouse like I did...total waste of money for these dry hunks of blandness.  I wouldn't know what they are like fresh, it wasn't sold to me that way...but at least my dog had dog chews.  Not sure why Amazon insists on selling worthless food rather than throw it away and risk ticking off customers and/or poisoning them.  I know they are closer to the expiration date buying it through the warehouse but seriously...THROW BAD FOOD AWAY AMAZON!  Sheesh."
"I love Next Organic Dark Chocolate Nutes! They are not overly sweet or too hard to chew. The dark chocolate coating is tasty.<br /><br />Brazil nuts are nutritious. My physician says they are a good source of selenium.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive, although then I might eat too many."
Very delicious and enjoyed by many people.  These pastels do not melt and do not require special storage or handling.
"It's ok, nothing special.<br /><br />Pro's<br />Good Price for 850 gum balls.<br /><br />Con's<br />Not sour enough.<br />Gum has no flavor when chewing.<br /><br />Will not buy again."
"While the treats were a little small for my three dogs, all over 70 lbs, they smell great and they loved them. Makes it easier to feed them something I know is good for them and can even break in half. I was a bit surprised at the smallness, however, I am willing to buy them again. This way when they get their treats, they think they are getting a whole lot :)"
"I absolutely love this stuff!!!  It would be wonderful on just about anything - grilled chicken, hamburger patties, steak, burritos.  It has an amazing taste, not hot at all.  It's a little high in fat at 11g. per serving.  But, if you're doing low carb there's only 3g. per serving.  My only problem is the serving size - 2 TBS.  There's no way I can just eat 2 TBS!  That's like trying to eat just one chip!  Can't be done.  I hope this becomes available in larger sizes.  A bucket size would be wonderful!!!  This stuff is that good.  Buy it!"
"Kettle Chips are the best potato chip God has ever invented.  I give the Lord thanks every day for delivering unto me such an incredulously delicious blend of ginger and spice, a veritable cornucopia of flavor.  I have actually changed my diet to a strict regiment of the Spicy Thai & Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors, alternating days. I have already lost 5 lbs, not to mention the myriad of other health benefits I have been experiencing. Get your life back - with Kettle Chips."
"Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific."
"These sardines really stand out as the best national brand.  I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.  At any given time, I've got a dozen or so (one case) stashed away, and I rotate them along with my other necessities."
"We've tried many of the K-cups that are available, and this is in our top 3. We prefer a darker, bolder flavor, and this one hits the mark. At the same time it's quite smooth."
"I originally tried this product because the ""oil-free"" caught my eye.<br />Having an acne prone skin, I thought this moisturizer would be perfect!<br />But after using this product a few times I noticed a few things...<br />CONS:<br />  -This product doesn't sink into your skin but rather stays on top and leaves your skin feeling oily and greasy.<br />  -My acne continued to break out, even more! :(<br />PROS:<br />  -Made my skin feel softer :)<br />  -Very long lasting, don't let the 3oz fool you!<br /><br />OVERALL: I stopped using this product after using about 1/4 of it. But hey, everyone has a different type of skin.<br />  If you feel that this moisturizer might be the one for you, go on and try it!"
"Molly and Cocoa, our cocker spaniels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in ""lite"" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.  I would highly recommend greenies for a great treat that helps clean dog's teeth and eliminate bad breath."
"Our family loves beef jerky, and although the flavor is good, the texture was really tough and difficult to chew."
"We have used soy formula for all of our three children, but chose to use organic soy for our third child.  We think the quality is great.  Our son had a lot of vomiting with milk based formula, and with regular soy he still spit up some, but with this organic soy he stopped completely.  He has no problems keeping the formula down, which is a relief to parents.  We use all of the products made by Earth's Best.  It great to know you are not putting all those chemicals in to your baby. Also, I would like to mention that if you use auto delivery through Amazon you get a discount, and you pay no shipping(they give you express shipping for free, so you get it within two days).  They also carry this formula at all Toy R Us, Babys R Us, and Whole Foods."
"When mixed perfectly, the MIO Mango Peach iced tea tastes like a diet version of Chili's Mango iced tea which I am a big fan of.<br /><br />The problem is that it is next to impossible to get a consistent strength. I try for 2 medium squirts for the right flavor, but there is no practical way to measure how much mix you are putting in your glass. It squirts out too hard to measure with a measuring spoon. So, some days it is too strong, and I end up dumping the whole thing. Other days, it starts too weak. Of course, adding more makes it too strong. Like Goldilocks, some days, it ends up just right, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bottle says that it has 24 servings. I haven't been counting, but it seems like a lot more than 24."
"Well, my cat seems to like this stuff... but he isn't really picky about his food. We get the special diet stuff to help him avoid urinary crystals, and he hasn't had any urinary issues since he's been eating this. I love the Subscribe & Save option for this! We just have a few different flavors on staggered shipping schedules to mix things up a bit, and it's the cheapest price around."
"This is an excellent coffee for drinkers like me who don't like an overwhelming vanilla flavor.  Some flavored coffees I have tried miss the mark and the additional flavoring covers up the coffee flavor.  This had just the right light vanilla flavor along with a nice, smooth coffee flavor.  If you are someone who likes a stronger flavor, this product might not be for you.  Personally, I really ejnoyed it and would recommend it."
"Recieved my order quickly, unfortunately, Loma Linda Linketts were shipped instead of the Tender Bits. I was so in the mood, these are so wonderful fried w/ a little crisp around the edges."
We love peanut butter and pepper jelly sandwiches so we've tried various brands.  This one is by far the best we've tried.  I also mix it with Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce by Huy Fong for a sweet sour sauce.
"I originally bought this based on the recommendation of a Petsmart employee -- and was congratulated several times on my choice.  I haven't been able to find it anywhere near by, so very happy to be able to order it on Amazon!  I think this is the best catfood I've ever seen, high quality ingredients and not stuffed with fillers that aren't really good for cats.  My cat loves it and he can be a bit picky about his food.  He just wants to eat this stuff all the time!"
"I drive a school bus and like to get something for all 120 of my ""little darlins"" at Christmas...These suckers have been around since I was a child and I loved them! They are the same great suckers and havent' been cheapend through the years. I put cute little sucker covers I purchased at ""oriental trading"" They fit great look adorable and the kids love them. It's a cute way to say I thought about you w/out spending to much money! I spend less then a dollar a present! I get to eat the left overs!"
"My son loved this. He actually likes this more than any other baby fruit. This is also very convenient. If you do not use it all at one time, then you just put the cap back on and put it in the fridge. They also take up less space in the diaper bag, and you do not have to worry about the jar busting."
I cannot buy these locally. I have looked all over. I have found the peppermint and on occasion I can find the wintergreen but never the cinnamon. I was introduced to the cinnamon via a wedding favor. I was able to find them when visiting in NC but last few times there I could not find them. I prefer the cinnamon Altoid Smalls. They are great. The Peppermint are a little too strong and the wintergreen are ok.
"This delicately flavored herbal tea has become a favorite of mine. It's soothing, relaxing, warming and leads me to a restful night. Hard to find except at Amazon!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O9E"">Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
"Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the ""mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets"" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry ""Believers of Miracles""... this is one that won't make ""The Tonight Show""!"
"In my area, you can not find this flavor.  I think this is a good price and I keep one in my purse, in the car, at work etc.  It is so convenient to purchase from amazon.  I am pleased with this product."
"Santa Fe brand is being sold here (Amazon.com) at something like $1.88 a bag, but you have to buy 8 at a time. And they are eligible for free shipping if you buy the $25 minimum order from Amazon. I haven't tried the Santa Fe brand, but think it might be worth checking out. The Mexicali Rose is just too expensive to even consider, even though the taste is great. It's the next best thing to home cooked, BETTER than home cooked if you're a gringo."
"This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable."
"My baby is 7 months old and maybe wasn't as ready for these biscuits as I imagined. He's got 2 bottom teeth and is very able to get chunks off these biscuits! The pieces take a long time to dissolve/break down in his mouth, but he handles it better than I would expect and he can't wait to dive in for more. He has tasted a wide variety of foods and I've never seen him get so excited about any of them. He LOVES Belle's Blueberry teething biscuits - especially after they've been in the freezer for a bit. Even though I have to watch him closely, they're exactly the cure for little man's teething pains!"
"Dear Sirs,<br /><br />I have not yet received this item!!!!!! I have placed the order back in April 2012 and till now, 12 June 2012 nothign has been received"
"The BEST chips ever. EVER!! I ordered a box and they were sooo goood. I was hooked. Then I got my roommate hooked and I think she ordered the monthly one! They are crisp and have a great soft crunch. Nice and cheesy. Can become addicted, so be prepared to support this habit :)"
"My dogs seem to like these treats, and the ingredient list suggests that there are only two ingredients - chicken and rice.  So, I have been purchasing these for a few years now, and both of my dogs like them (although the border collie has grown bored with them and will occassionaly reject them).  However, my concern is with the price of this product.  In Dec. 2008, I purchased this product (1 pound in a tub) for 10.99.  Now, in early february 2009, they have raised the priced to 18.55 - that has nearly doubled, so I won't be buying these unless the price drops back to somewhat reasonable."
"These are wonderful little treats, elegantly packed. A treat has to be good, satisfying with 1 or 2 bites, and worth every calorie.  These certainly are!  Crispy, light and sweet-hope Amazon carries these always. The lime essence is in the powdered sugar, so be sure to enjoy that with the cookies.<br /><br />A collection of 6 nicely packed boxes  enables you to give a nice box to a deserving friend. And these certainly are appreciated!<br /><br />Note: freshness is not an issue."
My husband used to stop at Dunkin Donuts for a muffin in the morning.  He really likes these so now I make them for him so he can grab one on the way out the door.  He also takes them to work to share with his work colleagues.
"The taste of Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee is so wonderful.  As soon as it begins to brew, you can smell it throughout the kitchen.  The taste is deep, rich, and sweet!"
"You need a pod maker capable of making this.  Maybe I'm a retard but I didn't know that based on the vine description.  Doesn't smell all that great.<br /><br />Honestly none of the instant coffees are any good, just get up 5 minutes earlier and make a pot of real coffee, hello."
"Tastes as wonderful as it smells, cinnamony. I drink it every day at work. It is delightful. It is a very happy tea. Everyone who comes into my office exclaims about how wonderful it smells. Our janitor says I have the sweetest smelling trash after I toss the used tea bags."
"This review is for the 24 pack of 3 Oz. cans of the Wellness Brand Cat Food.<br /><br />Objectively speaking...<br />The cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />Subjectively speaking...<br />I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.  Be good to yourself and your pets!"
"As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for a way to add zing to food.  Luckily, I added the chipotle sauce from Taco Bell to my meal, and it was delicious.  You only need a small amount to get a lot of flavor.<br /><br />I cooked 1/2 cup of Morningstar crumbles and 1/2 cup of Rotel tomatoes in a skillet till the liquid was cooked.  Then I removed from skillet, added 2 tblsp. chipotle sauce, added daiya non-dairy cheddar cheese and put in a tortilla wrap.<br /><br />Goes great with a side of refried beans, black beans, or Mexican corn.  Low in calorie, healthy, and filling.  I definitely recommend.  The only thing that would make it better is if the product were vegan."
"The K cup coffees are very good, but this unsweetened tea is delicious.  It tastes like the iced tea you can only get from a fine restaurant.  I make it in a 32 ounce cup full of ice and then water it down with another 32 ounces of water.  I highly recommend this tea."
I was really intrigued with this product.  I seemed to promise a new choice is artificial sweeteners.  On the plus side it comes in a small container that has 140 serving.  On the minus side you need to measure each serving out a 1/4 teaspoons at a time so it would be easy to get fewer serving than promised.  Another minus are the ingredients.  It states that the sweetener is made from monk fruit but that is the third ingredients listed.  Sugar is listed before Monk Fruit.  That makes me wonder if there are calories when you use more that the 1/4 teaspoon.  The last minus for me was the aftertaste.  I found it very strong.  With the ingredients minus and the aftertaste minus I cannot recommend this natural No Calorie Sweetener.
"The peanut butter cookies are very good but some of the packages the cookies were all broken up.  I had gotten the other cookies by ""Pamela"" and on the whole they were not broken up like the peanut butter ones.  They are very good so I will buy them again."
This coffee was bitter for my taste and not the strongest coffee either.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that it was the worst coffee I've ever had....but far from<br /><br />the deep rich robust coffee I am used to.
"I've purchased a few JBMC whole beans from different roasters over the years, and wanted to share my experience with this particular seller.<br />I was running low on my normal supply of JBMC and decided to give this seller a try, because of their slightly lower price, and they had it in stock and shipped it out immediately.<br /><br />My opinion is that the JBMC beans from this seller were either old, or something went wrong during their roasting process.  The grind has a slight sour smell when brewing, which in turn gives a slight bitter taste.<br />Good JBMC is very smooth; on the lighter side; slightly sweet and spicy with a nice finish.  Like good 100% Kona coffee, there is no bitter aftertaste.<br />I tried different grinds, #16 and #24, and prefer the #24 grind for a single cup brew.<br />The place I normally get this bean from (Lion Coffee) did get a fresh batch of JBMC beans in last week, so I was able to compare both; and the Lion JBMC roasted whole bean wins hands down.<br />My recommendation is that if you are willing to spend $30-$50 a pound for JBMC beans, make sure it's direct from one of their certified distributors like Mavis Banks."
"Using a Presto Hot Air popper, this popcorn works exactly as promised.  Almost every kernel pops quickly and the popcorn turns out light and fluffy."
I love this tea. This is my favorite and was sad not to see it in stores any longer. I was very happy to find it on Amazon. I also am happy with the automatic delivery.
"I love these! When I was a little girl in Hawaii we got these on special occasions, only. Even now, I save them for special days! The nuts are smaller now , though.I'm not sure if they are not allowed to get bigger due to high demand, or if it is the environment. Perhaps because I was only a little thing!"
This is my favorite of all the coconut waters available.  Love the mango flavor.  I drink after I do Bikram yoga and it's something I look forward to  having.
"My 18 year old Maine Coon loves it!  She has a hard time with dry food, so she eats mostly wet.  This variety she loves mixed with a little water.  It's about all she'll eat now!"
These were big hit with my baby when he first started solid. You can offer them to the baby without worrying about chocking as they dissolve in the mouth immediately. I tested them myself before offering them to my baby and they really do :)
"I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good."
This candy always tastes great. If you want it to taste even better leave it out to dry for a while until the outside becomes a little harder.
"Definitely has more heat, smell, and taste than the store bought stuff we were using. Taste great on oatmeal. We also used it for a homemade apple pie with some Muscovado sugar, turned out very nice."
"This is great stuff, used it for years.<br />But the title says 4.4 ounce boxes and the description says 3.5 ounces.<br />Our current (empty) box says 4.4 ounces, and the box in the picture here says 4.4 ounces.<br />Which is it?"
"This coffee is surprisingly good. It's a little pricey in comparison to regular drip coffee, but I am willing to pay that price for not having to clean the coffee pot, grind beans, wait for it to brew, etc when I am in a hurry to get to work in the mornings. One packet makes a large cup of coffee. I use about 14 oz of water and that still has plenty of flavor. In fact, I am drinking a cup of it right now. ;-)"
"TOP 10 REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS SAUCE<br /><br />10.Wolfgang Sucks should adorn this jar.<br />9.Drinking an entire bottle of Vodka is recommended before consumption.<br />8.You should vomit while buying it so that your used to the feeling after tasting this product.<br />7.The pans warped when the sauce was introduced.<br />6.Amnesty International filed a complaint representing the pasta that was tortured when the sauce touched it.<br />5.The KGB called they want thier top torture device returned.<br />4.Used diapers are jeolous<br />3.When opening the jar Gordon Ramsey is heard saying ""Whats wrong with you, your going to poison someone"".<br />2.Set Italian cuisine back 500 years.<br />1.Think hard now, has this guy ever made a good meal?"
"I think this rice is fantastic.  I have not had any of the packaging problems some other people have mentioned (and I would not be happy if I did - I do hope that issue is resolved).  Mine arrived fully intact and the rice itself is of the highest quality I have ever seen.  This is a product from Pakistan as that is clearly marked on the bag I purchased.  I use a little less water than is recommended by my rice cooker and it has always come out absolutely perfectly.  Each rice kernal is separated and fluffy and perfect.  Flavorful and aromatic.  I just love it.  I also highly recommend the Aroma ARC-856 rice cooker that is sold by Amazon.<br /><br />Here is how I cook this rice.  Using the measuring cup from my rice cooker - 2 cups of rice, 2 and 1/3rd cups of water, a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil (I use extra virgin olive oil if out), a taste of butter, sea salt, a dash of cinamon and a fair amount of fresh ground black pepper.  My mouth is watering just typing this :)<br /><br />I would love to read your favorite recipe in my comments section."
"My cats have been eating this for several years and up to now-have loved it.  I have purchased this product from pet shops and amazon.  This last shipment from amazon is not the same product as the label claims.  When the can is opened, it initially looks and smells like salmon, but underneath the 1/8 inch of a top layer of the real looking stuff, is something else.  It looks like a wee bit of the real product was sprayed over an imposter product, because it is not the same underneath, nor does it look or smell the same.  My cat vomited with the first feeding.  My cats don't like it now.  they eat the salmon coating and leave the rest.  I want to know where amazon got this batch of cans, because it is not Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance. Someone is duping us and we are paying a high price for a fraud. Identifiers on the bottom of the can are: NBSCP, best by Jan 13 15, the numbers below the sku on the box are: 723633004152."
I LOVE THIS TEA.  I WISH STASH STILL HAD THIS IN TEA BAGS.  I WAS ABLE TO TUCK THEM INTO GIFTS TO FRIENDS.  NOW I HAVE TO MAKE MY OWN BAGS TO GIVE AWAY.  THE TEA IS GREAT.
"I have tried every ""good"" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****.  Usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef, sometimes I would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating.... I know, I am a mess.  The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.  (I tried turkey/chicken and no go, has to be chicken rice) And you really DO feed a lot less with this food! I am saving money and getting better food.  YYYEEEEAAAHHHH!"
"These traditional Italian and Greek culinary delights are preserved in the ancient manner (Brine and Salt) and are from the perennial fishing grounds of the Meditterean Sea rather than Peru or who knows where? These are premium Anchovies whose quality far exceeds the supermarket variety. These anchovies are nothing like the slender, stiff, olive oil soaked fillet ""saltbombs"" found in the little 2OZ tins or glass jars at supermarkets everywhere. It would take about 16 of these tiny 2 OZ cans to approximate the same amount sold here. At up to $2.50 for 2OZ fillets X 16 the economic advantage becomes clear. In any case, it is the exceptional quality, size and flavor that should guide your purchase.<br /> As a bonus (if prepared correctly) they have a much reduced sodium content. It is true that they require simple preparation: Rinse the salt and soak in fresh water for about a 1/2 hour before filleting and easily removing the spine bone and optionally scales. A simple task that is rewarded by a supple, meaty anchovy fillet that makes any dish requiring anchovies as good as it can get. I usually soak and fillet the contents of the entire can in advance and put them in a small jar submerged in olive oil and store in the refrigerator for long term availability. You can also store the unused portion in the can they were packed in by salting the next exposed layer as the item description suggests but, for me, fiddling with plastic wrap and exposing the fish to absorb the flavor of the can in the refrigerator is solved by re-packing them in a convienient sealable container.<br />Used in pasta dishes with roasted grape tomatoes,sliced garlic, and olive oil(Acciughe + Pomodoro) you'll soon wish the can was even bigger. Try a three or four of them mashed with a few cloves of garlic & a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and add to beef stew for that subltle ""Umami"" flavor that enhances the beef flavor without any ""Fishy"" taste. Diners (including fussy children) will detect there's somthing special, but will not suspect fish had anything to do with it. It has the same effect as Worchester sauce or Thai fish sauce which is essentially fermented fish. These savory anchovies melt away in a variety of sauces and stews. Great(for anchovy lovers) on Pizza, salads, Anchovy butter for steaks- you get the idea... Having them handy will encourage their regular use. You will definitly want to add them to your regular cooking arsenal."
I bought this product as a replacement for Starbucks chai. But it is awful and taste horrible. Not that the Starbucks chai is any better. Waste of money if you know the real taste of chai. It is nowhere close to the taste of chai for real chai lover.
"I'm not the type to get heartburn easily, either, but this knocked me out. I don't know what about it, but it came on suddenly after eating so it couldn't have been what I had for breakfast (toast and jam). It was tasty enough, though some pasta or rice would should have been added, it was quite watery and not very much crab at all, though you could smell it, you couldn't see it."
"This item is really Season's brand of hearts of palm, not Asian Harvest.  Nevertheless, they are awful.  Extremely woody and very hard to chew on the outside layer, tender in the middle, with a terrible bitter aftertaste.  There are distributed by Manischewitz, a generally reliable vendor of food products.  This, however, is a travesty!  The comparison between these and the brand carried occasionally by Costco, SunPix, is like night and day.  SunPix are tender, smooth, and taste great.  These are the exact opposite."
"Mocha Java is a must for those who enjoy a mild and smooth tasting coffee, it is comparable to Italian Roast. I tried a few Timothy coffee brands and must say that this is a must for those who like a mild smooth coffee."
"Very good coffee.  You definitely have to like strong coffee to like this product -- it's a ""waker-upper"".  Definitely would order this product again."
"When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all."
"I looked at a lot of different types of holders for Kcups then finally decided on this one.  I am not regretting that decision. It's great that it has three segrated drawers.  I use one for decaf, one for regular and one for teas and hot cocoas.  Everyone knows just where to find their favorite.  It is also of very sturdy construction -- heavy, not cheap.  Top acts as a little shelf for condiments too.  Very happy with this purchase!"
"I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit. The other was very hesitant and didn't finish it. I won't buy this again."
"My family loves brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts, and these didn't disappoint. They arrived in perfect condition and the pop tarts themselves are wrapped nicely; better than the usual thin wrapper used for grocery store purchases."
I had never heard of Walker's biscuits before and I was really surprised how good they were.  The ginger cookies had pieces of ginger in them - delicious and the chocolate biscuits were different and tasted great.  The honey oat biscuits were also very good.  I would like to order them separately.
"I agree with the other reviewer that it isn't exactly ""hearty,"" but it is very good for a side dish or appetizer. I'll give it 5 stars for a nutritious and tasty packaged soup -- without msg or other deadly ingredients often found in other soup mixes. Sodium is the only ""bad,"" but it's a good soup."
"Our baby (11-months-old) is now on solid foods and we try to feed him a great variety of items. The doctor said he could eat the same foods we eat. Well, that's good to know but we need a things that are easier to eat. In part, we make up concoctions of our own dishes but reduced to a mush. In addition, my wife found this Earth's Best Organic line of baby foods at a local store. They have quite a lineup of foods, but the brand and all varieties can be a little hard to find.<br /><br />One thing he seems to like are fruit and grain mixtures, so we picked up a variety pact as well as individual jars and we include a jar in his daily intake. My wife likes the organic aspect with no preservatives or additives and the baby seems to enjoy the foods. We're gradually trying more and more of the Earth's Best Organic lines of food, and we've been very satisfied so far.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!"
"My family is from Holland so we enjoy many Dutch and German foods.  On a recent trip to visit family, my cousin had Douwe Egberts Coffee in the house.  It's the only brand they drink.  My wife and I loved it.  Great flavor, no bitterness, smooth.  Just what you want in a good cup of coffee.  Great anytime of the day.  The aroma when perking is also great.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  The Aroma Rood is the only one we have tried, but I'm sure the other types are good also.  As you can imagine, Douwe Egberts is very popular in Holland.  Glad we can get it here.  Amazon has the best deal on this coffe that I have found on the internet."
"Being a chocoholic AND a diabetic, this syrup solves a lot of problems for me!  I use this in my coffee and even in Diet Coke.  It gives me just enough of a chocolate flavor that I don't crave it otherwise.  When Starbucks here quit having sugar-free chocolate available for my mocha (WHAT were they THINKING???), I had to take matters in to my own hands.  Considering what I'm saving by passing up the Starbucks, I can easily afford to have this shipped (in a pack of 3) directly to my house on a regular basis!"
"I love Pop Chips!  They are similar to a regular potatoe chip, but lighter though just as crunchy!!  I say give them a try -- they are definitely worth it!"
My family has used this product for at least the last 50 years plus.  It has the best flavor and is not bitter like some powders can be. It also always has such a  warm color which makes a difference in presentation. Please do not discontinue this product. A tried and proven product.
"It's rich and dark without being bitter with the burnt bean taste.  I love this coffee.  It's a tad expensive, but well worth the cost.  I keep it as my private stash and only serve it on the holidays to company."
I bought these after I ran out of the Celestial Spiced India Chai and I was instantly addicted. This is the best tasting chai (outside of a cafe) I have ever had. You can't go wrong with this creamy and sweet choice!
"I thought my review from the single item listing would carry over to here, but it didn't. I've got to warn guys off of this useless ""tool.""<br /><br />This thing was obviously designed by a woman. Trying to be ""proper"" with my comments, women don't have the same ""hardware"" to be cleaned.<br /><br />It doesn't fit your hand. When you're slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto. It's useless for building lather, even with our soft water. Both sides are too small. Because of the shell, you can't run it between your toes, nor use it even on ground-in dirt between your fingers.<br /><br />And I'll try to be as delicate as I can here-- For washing male ""private parts,"" it's impossible. Both front and back.<br /><br />My wife's normal pink ""poof"" is far better.<br /><br />Put it in packaging you might see in an auto parts store, and label it a ""tool."" (Obvious male-directed marketing.) It's still trash. If I were to buy a tool as useless as this, it would be returned to the parts store ASAP."
3 $ in the supermarket!!! its taste good with coffe or cooking. just price is so hight here...ill just go store buy it .
"I use this when I fry eggs and they are the best tasting eggs ever! This oil will make your eggs slide right out of the pan,unlike butter that will burn and stick.This is a  much healthier product to use to cook with and it's also great for your skin, hair and nails.Try this Coconut Oil. You will be amazed at the difference in taste. Check it out @amazon.com"
Overall a very good gift. I sent it back to my family just as a mid season gift and they enjoyed it immensely. Recomended.
"I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!"
These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.
"I started drinking this when I was stationed in Korea. It was a quick way to get my morning coffee. It is just enough for one small cup. One stick has instant mocha coffee, powdered cream and a little sweetener. I would add some half&half and a little vanilla flavoring to make it even nicer. My stomach can't handle brands like Nescafe so I was happy to discover I could tolerate this. It is more expensive, of course, to buy it this route. But, sometimes when the craving hits, it's worth the extra cost."
"nom nom nom. Oreos are just delicious at every age. Eating these just brings back so many fond memories of my childhood. They make a good snacking food in the afternoon or even in the morning. Just be warned, these things are filled with sugar. Each pack has 6 oreos, which I tihnk is too much for one serving. I usually split one pack for two days."
"When I was young my mother bought a Swedish rye bread at the A&P. I ate great quantities of it.  Sadly, that product is no longer available.  But this Siljans crisp bread has the same taste and texture as the bread I remember. So I am very happy that I found this.  I hope it will continue to be available."
Love this product!  It adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners.  Hope this product is here to stay!
"I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first."
"This is a really elegant looking carosel, it holds plenty of KCups, its rotates very smoothly, its basically exactly what you are looking for."
Come on now.  how can you make a 20th anniversary deluxe edition without having the original version.  Not to say it is not a great movie but hey there is no need to edit the movie just so you can show it on disney channel.  I mean no offense but did the producers of this movie say hey why not edit it like a CD so we can sell it at walmart.  Come on where is the love of a good movie.
"I recently returned from visiting Hawaii and this coconut water was in all the ABC stores I visited. I am completely hooked. I used to drink Vitacoco Pineapple flavored coconut water because it had so much flavor, this product is plenty sweet and flavorful without anything added. Excellent product."
"great products to try if just wanting something on the go versus carrying fresh fruit. Portions are small for the price- yet we expected so given the product being dried fruit.<br />Liked the products, wouldn't buy again just due to high cost for amount you get."
"I like Strawberry the best!<br />Tastes to good I eat one every day, can't help it, and sometimes even two.<br />Can be an addictive habbit, good luck!"
"How come Blueberry now (2011) cost more then Banana Nut or Chocolate Chip. It is the same product , the same company and the same size, the only difference is the flavor. Customers should not have to pay extra for a different flavor.  Were do Amazon get this from.<br />This is like charging $.50 for a pack of tropical punch Kool-aid, $.40 for a pack of orange, and $.30 for a pack of Wild Berry, mind you that it is all the same size.  What is this?, is it that Blueberry taste better then Banana Nut? So Amazon is charging for the flavor. What the Hey? Amazon gets to say which flavor is better.<br />This is like saying Coke is better then Pepsi, this is not for Amazon to decide."
I have 2 cats and neither would eat them without a pill in them. They are spoiled by the brand Temptations and don't like anything else for a treat. They only eat 9 lives dry and canned so i guess they are picky. I have bought every brand cheap and expensive and guess i'll give up.
Not worth the price!!! Has a very bitter taste!!!!! You have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn. Does not help coat the throat in anyway!!!!!!
"My dog (GSD - 2 years) is an extremely picky eater.  He likes the TOTW DRY dog food, but he only eats it when he feels like it.  Sometimes he will only eat every other day.  I started adding TOTW CANNED dog food (the same kind as the dry) to his kibble and he LOVES it.  Instead of just sniffing the food and walking away, he instantly eats it as soon as I put the bowl down.  I have read that canned dog food is much better than the dry kibble because there is less chemicals and although a meal consisting of only canned food could be pretty pretty expensive with a big dog like mine, adding the canned food into his dry allows him to get the benefits of the canned food, makes him eat more consistently, and even ends up saving you money.  Great product."
It doesn't get any better than this! My one year old son LOVES these as do I. He loves them because they are fun to eat and delicious. I love them because they are wonderful for on the go and very healthy! This is by far the best product I have come across in a very long time! We will be ordering these frequently!
Excellent product.  Our dogs sure like these - we've ordered them several times and they always make a hit. The product arrived quickly and was nicely packaged.
"This is my favorite blend of the ones I have tried.  Very good value (or was.. when I got free delivery from Amazon).  Just looked it up and it doesn't seem to be available right now from Amazon.  I will not pay shipping fees for any brand.  As others have said it is rich, smooth with no bitterness. I hope it is available when I run out of t-disks."
"Copper Moon Dark Roast Sumatra coffee is my favoite and when friends stop by,<br />they are amazed at how great my coffee is and wants to know what I do and I just tell them""It's Magical""."
I received the tea very fast.  It is a delightful tea and I sleep so well after having it near bedtime.  Thank you for being so helpful.
"I raise Australian Shepherds and it has been important that the food the mom eats can be fed to the puppies. ALL my adult Aussies have had skin irritations from the other (Purina) products we had used, so when my female was bred, I switched her to this food. She LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it, and now that the puppies are at weaning age, they ALSO gobble it up. GREAT STUFF!!!"
"I feed my two Pugs and occasional rescue Newman's Advanced Dog formula. I like this better than the regular Newman's, because it has less ingredients. I supplement with high quality can food, organic free range chicken, healthy powder and salmon oil. My boys are healthy; their coats are amazing. Highly recommend but with supplements--see above."
"I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some."
Every person I try to pawn one of these drinks off on has one sip and the rest is thrown away.<br /><br />I bought a 12 pack of each flavor two months ago... still have 10 left in each pack.<br /><br />The coconut water from concentrate in New Zico is bad for me. It gave me and my girlfriend heart burn.<br /><br />Natural coconut water is better than concentrate.
"If you like spicy snack food, this is it.  I love this product.  My favorite is the ketchup fries.  I tried the buffalo one and Wow!  Too hot, but good.  The regular ones are good.  My store will not stock up on these so I'm buying here.  These are REAL tasty.  Will buy again.  Also, they don't weight you down.  They are light and no trans fats.  Yum!"
"This is great coffee!  I'm drinking my first ever cup right now and the taste is amazing.  I was a little concerned because it didn't smell that ""caramel-ly"" when grinding or making it.  The taste is great.  It's as smooth as people say and the flavor is the best caramel I've tasted yet, and I've been searching for a good one.  Highly recommend this, shipped quickly."
I am so happy that I discovered this food. My cats love it - they won't eat without it mixed in to their foods.
"Some coffees try to impress by including a particular strong added flavor or mixing in a variety of tastes so as to distract from the often bitter taste of the coffee itself.<br /><br />This Melitta Cafe doesn't do that.  Rather it has a very pure, direct and yes smooth taste that is surprisingly not bitter.  It is a coffee for those who enjoy sitting down with a hot beverage and enjoying the moment.  It does not grab your attention, but that's not what I'm looking for in a cup of coffee.<br /><br />The mix of dark and light roasts are very finely blended, and give the coffee a robust flavor, and a great, welcomed dose of caffeine.<br /><br />I'd definitely get this again."
"These are the first yellow grits I, or my family, have every eaten and I must say they are delicious!I priced them at a local store and they are much cheaper here."
"It's wonderful that you offer K-cups in ""bulk"" and at a great price too! For sure I'll be purchasing more through Amazon and in different flavors too. Ordering was very easy and shipment received before expected. Thanks lots."
"My american bulldog loves this puzzle. This was his first time using a puzzle toy like this, and he was able to figure it out pretty quick. Now everytime I get it out he knows exactly what to do :D I would recommend to anyone who wants to challenge their dog a little bit. It is definatly something you would not want to let your dog use unattended b/c of it being all plastic."
"We have a miniature Dachshund named Buck. We used this product to house and obedience train him. Now we use this as his daily treat, and he loves it! My Vet. told me this is a nearly prefect low fat treat. As a result of using Pro-Treat, we hardly ever have to use a leash while walking Buck. If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices. It ranges from powder to 1 inch square, and every thing in between. I have done lots of research and Amazon is the best place to buy this stuff"
"This is a great deal!  Esspecially for those who do a lot of cooking and baking and thus go through vanilla like crazy (like me).  McCormicks is a quality brand and I normally pay between $2-$3 for 2oz at my local grocery store, and here I was able to get 16oz for about $12!  MUCH better deal."
"I found this bar to be one of the best I've eaten. Planters makes other chewy bars, some of which are quite tasty. But the combination of the three nuts and the larger bar size create a truly excellent blend of flavors and textures: sweet, salty, crunchy, and chewy. With a combination like that, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />The only down side to this product is the fact that there are only 5 bars per package, whereas 8 is more normal. However each bar is larger than other bars. While eating this, one should be aware that the larger size means that there are 220 calories in each bar, more than a smaller bar.<br /><br />But the taste is worth the cost (in money and calories)!"
"This makes an amazingly delicious red curry! I add 1 packet of paste, 2 cans coconut milk (the real stuff, with the fat), 2 Tablespoons fish sauce, 3 chicken breast, 1 red pepper, 1 can of pineapple, 1 small can of bamboo shoots, and 1/4 cup sugar. Chop and simmer it all for about 30 minutes, and serve over rice. It has just the right amount of heat, and tastes like something you would get from an authentic Thai restaurant. Of course, you can use whatever veggies you have on hand, these are just my favorites. I make a large pot, and freeze it in individual containers for a super-fast meal. Taste of Thai Red Curry Paste, I don't know what I would do without you!! (Actually I do, and my Thai take-out bills would be outrageous!)"
"Apart from a hunk of quality dark chocolate, this could be the best dark chocolate treat I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's made with one of the worst oils you can ingest, but so are many. Not too sweet, leaves you wanting more.  Seriously good, and I've had plenty to compare."
This is a great soup mix. I didn't find it salty at all. I actually add some seasoning and stir in frozen veggies and spinach. I've ordered on more than one occasion and recommend it. You can experiment with the consistency by adding or subtracting the amount of water used. I find it comes out less thick by keeping it covered as it cooks. otherwise it tends to get pretty thick. Its all your preference though.
"I was served this jam at breakfast in a hotel near Niagara on the Lake and liked it so much that I bought some at their in-town store. Also bought the apricot and the triple berry, all are superior in quality to what you'd typically find in the supermarket. The black currant jam is my favorite. Highly recommended."
"Though I got a few doubles of different kinds of vanilla, this was such a great variety of coffee. Fortunately, I love vanilla, so no biggie. I didn't get any tea in this one. Shipping was quick and arrived loose in the box which wasn't an issue. Will be ordering from here again, kudos!!"
"These smart fries are a great alternative to the usual chips, pretzels, and tortilla chips. You get a heap of pieces for 110 cals (I think about 60), and it definitely does satisfy that salty snack craving I get from time to time. As for the flavors, we got the 6 variety mix. Some were definitely good (the BBQ and japapeno ones were best in my opinion) but others were a bit rough to get through (like the vinegar/salt). Regardless, I definitely plan to get some more in the future."
"My daughters and I discovered these candies more than 15 years ago, and we have bought them each time we have been in France.  I am so happy to be able to order them here now - no matter the cost!  They are delicious and so uniquely different, and they arrived in just a few days! Shhh!  Let's keep these our own special secret!"
"It takes trying a few other brands of coffee, to find one that is very tasteful and smooth to the taste. My opinion is: San Francisco Bay Coffee, Fog Chaser is the best."
"So like others I bought these without reading the reviews. I had a couple handfuls and paid for it as 6 hours later had the worse gas ever. They taste really good, but I ate too many of them ( even though 2 handfuls shouldn't be that much ) So now I eat in moderation, about 10 at a time, and I am ok.. But I won't buy them again- The side effects aren't worth it!"
"If you suffer high blood pressure these MAY cause you to have issues, I don't mess around when I say it. So be forewarned, while I am young and don't have any blood pressure issues I know others that have. So keep this in mind that the salt content is a little extreme.<br /><br />The chips are good, not potatoe-y tasting, though. Taste like a pringle feels like a starchy corn chip.<br /><br />And here is some information about their newly added flavor, Jalapeno, I have received the ingredient list for everybody here to examine before purchasing since it is currently hard to find..<br /><br />---JALAPENO INGREDIENTS----<br /><br />NATURAL POTATO INGREDIENTS (POTATO FLAKES, POTATO STARCH), SUNFLOWER,<br />SAFFLOWER, AND/OR CANOLA OIL, JALAPENO SEASONING (DEHYDRATED VEGETABLES,<br />[GREEN BELL PEPPER, PARSLEY, GARLIC, ONION, GREEN ONION], SALT, SUGAR,<br />MALTODEXTRIN, RICE FLOUR, CITRIC ACID, JALAPENO PEPPER, YEAST EXTRACT,<br />TORULA YEAST, SPICE, NATURAL FLAVOR), RICE FLOUR, JALAPENO PEPPER EXTRACT,<br />SALT.<br /><br />-------------------------"
"I saw a TV segment wherein a chef specified the use of ""Japanese mayonnaise"" in a recipe, so I Googled it and found it on Amazon.  It comes in a very soft, pliable, plastic container, kind of floppy (Phthalates???).  It isn't much different than American Mayonnaise but does differ in a couple of areas.  It is a bit more tart and tastes more ""egg'y"" to me.  It says it's made with ""vegetable oil"".  Not sure what that is comprised of, possibly all or part soy, which is something I am trying to stay away from since, if it's not organic, is genetically engineered (GMO).  If the phthalates and the GMO aspect are not an issue with you, go ahead and try it."
"They taste great, BUT one bar gave me VERY bad stomach pains and diarhrea for several days.  Unfortunately I didn't realize it was the bar for a week.  I just thought I was sick.  Do a google search and you'll find dozens of people with similar reactions."
"Do not buy this soup!  I bought their lentil and vegetable at a county fair.  Bad decision!  The ""vegetable"" contains nothing but desiccated potatoes - no other vegetables!  The lentil taste is horrible. The soup is expensive so  money wasted.  I complained to this company and they could care less."
"The passion fruit flavor comes out loud and clear and the chunks of aloe vera added a pleasant textural variety. My only preferance would be a little less of the cane sugar sweetener, but most people won't have a problem with this as they prefer sweeter drinks."
"Quite tasty; mild chocolate flavor, good crunch, the right sweetness.  Maybe a teeny bit sandy, but that doesn't stop them from being a good snack or dessert.  Probably perfect for someone who doesn't like too rich a chocolate flavor. Also very tasty with peanut butter spread on them."
"This is the only prepared marinara sauce I've ever had that approaches that I make at home. There are discernable chunks of tomato, carrot etc. in the sauce - so if you are one of those people who prefer a completely smooth sauce, it's not for you. Also if you are used to a very sweet sauce, this is not for you. But if you like real authentic marinara, absolutely this is the right product. The spices are balanced and the tomatoes have the right mix of acid, sweetness and tomato flavor. Look at the ingredient list - everything is natural, no weird chemicals or preservatives. Plus the aseptic cartons will keep almost forever. One carton is more than enough for two adults and one child who loves pasta, for one meal. So one case is going to keep us in spaghetti, lasagna, manicotti, stuffed shells, etc. for a long time and the cost point was great, taking into account the free shipping. This is just a fantastic food product and I wish I'd tried it sooner."
"My greyhound seems to like these a lot, and they don't give her loose stool (which plenty of things do).  Great healthy ingredients -- besides being grain free which is all I'll buy, I love the lack of additives or dubious ingredients.  This will be a repeater for me -- well it is already, as I got my first batch at a fancy pet food store I was visiting and came to Amazon to get more (for much less!)."
"My cats like Fancy Feast no doubt and I got a good price on this product.  However, the down side... the cats are not crazy about this flavor and one of them throws up from it and they do not throw up from any other foods.  I put it side by side with the Fancy Feast poultry and they gobble that up with no getting sick.  For whatever reason the Filet Mignon flavor is just not a hit with them and it is also from my perspective in comparison to other selections it doesn't smell good either.<br /><br />I am only giving two stars over one because I do tend to like the Fancy Feast name and so do my cats.  Another cat might like this flavor just fine but my crew does not."
"I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!"
"I'm still searching for a cherry tea I really like.  This one has a very mild cherry flavor (I wouldn't be able to identify it as such if the label didn't say ""cherry"")."
Great way for kids to get in their fruits and veggies. I add to yogurt & smoothies.
"My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count."
A very rich coffee especially for a decaf and perfect for those that like larger cups of coffee but are trying to restrict caffeine intake. I find that Amazon has many more choices than most for the K Cup and most of the time better prices. It is nice not to be so restricted with the decaf choices and this one is a tasty one but definitely bold!
"I think these things are disgusting.  I have celiac disease so I gave these a try one day when (after 5 years of not having had a pretzel!) I had a craving - it was like eating really, really, really HARD cardboard.  Tasteless and HARD.  I'd rather go 5 years more than eat another one of these pretzels!"
"I've been fortunate to consistently drink this water since the release of it at the November Retreat and since my life has changed dramatically. As somebody who is well aware of the importance of water and drinks upwards to 2-3 gallons a day when I am training, this water puts the life back into my body and allows me to push it to new levels. The graphics on it are exceptional and when I am drinking it out in public I always get asked ""what is Trivedi Water"" and I am never short of energy to explain it.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Trivedi for your hardwork and efforts in all that you do. I truly believe in the power of his energy and if you are interested in this water then check out [...] for more of Mr. Trivedi."
"This couscous is easy to prepare and quite tasty all on its own. When I make it I use a really good extra virgin olive oil and some chopped fresh tomato right before I cover it.  You basically boil water, add salt, oil, tomato, cover it and it's ready in 7-10 minutes. YUM."
I like the flavor of this tea.  It is not subtle in any way.  The lemon coupled with ginger provides a very drinkable and somewhat stomach soothing combination.  My little kids think the ginger is a little bit spicy but they will also drink it.
"These aren't bad noodles, but they're certainly not the greatest. In all honesty, they taste almost exactly like Maruchan's beef flavoured noodles, but a tad bit better. Unlike Shin noodles, it has a lot less sodium in it, for those who have heart trouble. It has roughly half the sodium that Shin has, (Shin having between 30-50% depending on the flavour you get).<br /><br />If you interested in trying some different kind of noodles for some reason or another, then I would recommend trying this."
"I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save."
"I purchased this product because one of my cats, Opus, has lymphoma and was not eating.  The Sprinkles were supposed to make food irresistable.  Not only did Opus show no interest in the Sprinkled food but Shadow, the healthy one, also turned up her nose.  Fortunately, medication has helped Opus' appetite but they still don't want the Sprinkles."
"I've never been much of a soda drinker, so I'm always on the lookout for alternative beverages like juice and tea.  Lately, I've been swept up in the craze of coconut water.  When I saw this bottle of 'aloe water' I immediately wondered what the new flavor was.<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I was reminded of the smell of apple juice.  Aloe Gloe has a very sweet, crisp flavor.  Considering there is a both cane sugar AND Stevia sweetening up this drink, I guess that isn't a surprise.  It's very pleasant and enjoyable, and would be extremely refreshing chilled and served on a hot summer's day.<br /><br />One odd note, though: if you drink directly from the bottle, there's a distinctive plastic  note to the liquid.  That was rather disconcerting.  I think that if you drink it from a glass this would probably be alleviated."
It's really cute and my boyfriend and I love it.  It's also been a very easy plant to take care of.
"smokehouse almonds are great but i just can't take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town, if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again."
"Just got my first can of Pero at Whole Foods. It's absolutely delicious and does not give you the buzz like decaf sometimes does. It tastes similar to Taster's Choice decaf, but without the acidity! So far very happy with it, looked for a very long time and glad that I finally found it! In case anyone cares, it's made in Germany."
A LONG WAY TO GO TO SOUTH CAROLINA FOR OUR FAVORITE BBQ SAUCE - SO HAVING IT SHIPPED FREE IS GREAT. CAN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN MAURICE'S
"I stop in daily for a cup of coffee at our local gas station because I tried this once and was hooked. I tried to find it locally but the closest I could find any was a 2 hour drive away. With free shipping, this pack of 3 bags is a great buy compared to buying it a cup at a time. Smooth, rich coffee!"
Perfect training treat for our lab. He loves them and they are tiny so I don't worry about over feeding him.
Love this decaf that has extra body.  Twin packs arrived on time or earlier and without damage.  Would certainly order again.
Completely enjoy Starbucks K-Cups... but I get them at Costco.  54 for 39.99.  Roughly .74 a K-Cup.  Amazon is over a $1 a K-Cup.
This is the second time I ordered this coffee.  Very good blend with a very smooth taste.  You can't go wrong if you like Hazelnut coffee.
Don't know why this is here as I never purchased this item.
I love the taste of this gum!  It actually holds its taste longer than any other sugar free or sugar gum I have tasted.  It also leaves you mouth feeling fresh after chewing.  Great product!
"The Barbeque Flavor of these Pretzel Pieces is tangy to me (not sweet, honey, smokey or even hot).  I am not a big fan of tangy Buffalo Wings, but I am a fan of these tangy pieces.  Be warned:  there are plenty of big pieces, but there are also a lot of crumb pieces.  4.5 Stars."
"Hi love these granola, I lightly fill the bowl with cold milk, let it just sit long enough to have the milk color and then drink it and scoop the granola out. Delicious !<br />My wife thinks it's too sweet though."
"This is one of my diet staples.  When I first ate it, I admit that it sort of tasted like cardboard to me.  But that's because I was used to eating crap like cocoa krispies.  Now, I can't imagine going back.  I've grown to love the earthy flavor and substantial texture of this cereal.  I let it soak in milk a bit before eating, and if I'm in the mood for sweetness, I sweeten it with stevia or splenda.  Yum!"
"This cereal is one of my favorites! It has amazingly few calories and high fiber, yet it is not the typical cardboard. It is light and crunchy, with a little bit of honey sweetness!!! Not as sweet as sugary kids cereal, but I'm started to prefer less sugary foods... I really recommend, for kids or for the kid at heart!"
I was very disappointed in the taste of this product. I have had some great tasting Manhattan Chowder in restaurants. Hard to find in cans. Thought I would try this. I wish I could have bought just one can to try. I did not like it at all..
This is one of my favorite breakfast cereals and I enjoy buying in bulk when I can get a good price for something that I really like and use frequently.
"It is difficult to find pecan roasted coffee. Fortunately, my daughter did some searching and found this one. It is even better than the ones we use to get at the supermarket."
"I have, at this point, made these rolls several times and they have gone out to rave reviews from my friends every time, whether they are eating gluten free or not.  I want to next try using this mix to make a sandwich pocket or pizza.  The texture is great, chewy and crusty, which you seldom find in a non gluten bread."
"This is so tasty, but like others have said, it is nothing like corn nuts.  It's crunchy, but  not too crunchy.  Delicious."
"When I ordered a 5lb string of this salame, no one made me aware that the weight was random. But according to Brian at Taylor's market this is exactly the case. I sent him an e-mail stating that I had received 4lbs of salame instead of the 5lbs advertized and he told me that the weight is random. Shame on them!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"It's been a long time since such a new and delicious flavor combination has captured my attention, but Pomegranate Tootsie Pops have my tastebuds singing a song of praise.  So out of the ordinary and completely satisfying.  One pop does it all.  Bring them on soon!"
Greenies are wonderful for giving medicine to your canine friends.  My dog knows when his pill is due and will sometime go sit by the cabinet waiting for his meds (disguised in a pill pocket).  No more forcing medicine--he reminds me!
"This is a nice change from using powdered stevia. I find that it is better to use in drinks like tea (but please, please, please if you must sweeten coffee, just use raw sugar (not that white powdered junk). I like to use this to sweeten my oatmeal (discovered that a few drops of stevia and a few drops of maple extract in oatmeal tastes pretty darn good). My only complaint is that this was shipped very poorly (two glass bottles in a large box with two plastic air bags). One bottle was broken and had made a huge mess all over the inside of the box. Luckily the folks at amazon were willing to compensate for the loss."
"We tried this food and unfortunately it gave the dogs bad breath (a fishy smell). It also made one of our dogs drag her butt, which she does not do when she eats Blue Buffalo Lamb version. We switched back to Lamb."
"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!"
"Now, I have to say, I am wildly impressed with Red Leaf Tea. With the sheer amount of matcha I've been getting through this promotion, I was starting to feel like I was taking advantage of their goodwill and resolved to hang up my reviewing hat, saying that I had tried all the flavors I wanted to try. Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product. But by now they know me, and they know my reviews and they're just wonderfully kind to me. When I received my package yesterday, I found a little matcha spoon included with my order! I don't know if it's a promotion I just didn't see, or if it was for me specially, but it certainly made my day!<br /><br />I don't know an awful lot about English toffee, but what I do know, I like. I got this one to try with my wife, in an effort to get her to like matcha. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br />When I opened the package, it smelled a lot like the Caramel Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, which is very promising. I love their Caramel matcha. Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm. This would be a very good starter matcha for those who like sweet things, English Toffee especially. I might even win my wife over with this one!"
"These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said."
"Luv, luv, this granola...the only thing is that I received 6 big bags that expired in 5 weeks which is alot to eat for this single lady."
"Quick, efficient, and very addicting. These things are awesome if you want something to take the edge off of hunger pangs."
"Don't even try to oven bake your fish with this product, batter stick to the pan and the fish falls apart.  Deep fry only!"
"I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a ""candy dish"" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces."
"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
"I have been baking with this product for two years. It is far and away the BEST product out there -- offering a wonderful texture and flavor. I have made cakes, pies, cookies, scones, pizza, cornbread, cobblers, and of course, pancakes and waffles. I particularly like this mix becuase it does not have sugar in it, and I have to use xylotol (which I have found to be the best sugar alternative). The two work beautifully together.<br /><br />Here's my issue. I have a standing order with Amazon to ship this product in bulk once every six months. I have found that I need it every four months. Amazon does not offer that option. It gives me the options of 1,2,3, or 6 months. Several times I have had to go through a tedious process of changing the timing on the ship date (which is not easy to find in the My Account section of Amazon. In fact, I have had to call you folks for their cutomer service number to help me navigate through it.<br /><br />Please ask them to expand the timing options for shipping -- to add 3, and 4 month intervals as well. Your customers other than me will appreciate it, I'm sure.<br /><br />Hats off to you folks. I sure appreciate you. Years ago, I had to mess with making my own baking mix, and it was never as good as yours.<br /><br />A loyal customer.<br /><br />Christine Boos"
"This is by far the best flavored coffee compared to Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Peets, and any other I can think of.  Genuine sweet chocolate and rasberry smell and flavor.  A yummy sweet version that tastes exactly right (not like any other flavor).  I strongly recommend this one, cinnamin, pumpkin, and german chocolate cake.  Just don't join Gevalia.  There customer service is terrible.  If you google them you'll see.  Order from Amazon instead."
This powdered cocoa peanut butter is really good and easy to mix with water. Wala you have creamy peanut butter. I add the water slowly so i can get it to the thickness i like. Very nice substitute for the fat loaded type. I get mine at Amazon. I have prime shipping so no tax and free shipping make this right up my alley.
"Roasted, unsalted soy nuts are not the most delicious snack. So before you buy 12, 9 oz packages, you should try a small quantity at your local health food store or asian grocer. If you know you want roasted, unsalted soy nuts, Amazon's offering from the Bergen Nut Company is an excellent source and good price. When I open a package, I transfer them to a tupperware container for easy snacking while I sit at my computer when working. It's a healthier alternative to satisfy a craving to munch."
"I think its a fair price point for the amount of product and quality. I am an avid baker and have used many different types of cocoa over the years. This is by far the best to bake with....it works well with splenda, sweet-n-low, and regular sugar. The cocoa taste is altered if you use aspartame or the phenyl....whatever. Price is higher than grocery store and lower than other high ends."
"I actually got some of this as a gift myself and was instantly addicted.  I am also amazed to have seen a review saying it was hot.. I don't know what that guy was eating but it was NOT this product.  It is not hot and all (and not spicy).  Soon to try it as a salad topping.  It is really nice to finally find some snacks that are satisfying, tasty and nutritious as well.  Heck...I'd eat the stuff even it wasn't nutritious... it's that good!!"
"Don't be fooled by appearances--the chocolate taste on these nuts is very subtle. They look to be coated in melted chocolate, but it's more of a delicate dusting, so if you're looking for chocolate-coated candy, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a lighter, nutty pick-me-up, you can't go wrong with these.  Highly recommended!"
"I ordered based on the reviews, and while it is better than the likes of most coffees, I'm not really impressed.  I think I'll try Kick Ass next.  Being this coffee is at the highest roast temp, I assumed it would be very smokey, but I find that the Diedrich French Roast is more smokey and more smooth.  The beans did not seem as dark as I expected them to be.  They look more of a typical dark roast, below a French or Italian roast.  Who knows, maybe I'll like Kick Ass better.  And BTW, Diedrich is much cheaper ($9 for 12 oz)."
"I didn't pay attention when I ordered these jelly beans, and was shocked at how small the box really is.  Only 1.2 ounces.  I paid WAY too much for them, but I hope my daughter, who is a Harry Potter nut, will enjoy them.  Currently, Amazon has 2 boxes of these available for a better price than 1."
"I found the reviews on here to be completely misleading.<br /><br />Let me put this simply...<br /><br />This jerky is mediocre at best. The meat is very moist and has a lot of flavor but is overly sweet and salty, almost as if they drenched this in syrup and soy sauce before cooking it. The name Spicy Country should be changed to Mild Country. The slices are too thick and look like boba straws. I also wouldn't recommend it if you prefer your jerky a little more chewier.<br /><br />Positive side: $15 for jerky might be steep but 8 oz is a lot and it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />It's good jerky, but not the best.<br /><br />If you're looking for some good jerky. Try Jack Links Peppered. It's one of the best jerky's I've had and it's available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />If you're ever in Gilroy, CA, visit the Garlic Shoppe. BEST beef jerky I ever had. Its by the cashier in the clear box, get a bag and enjoy : )<br /><br />Cheers"
this is the best cat food ever the cats love it a bit pricy but at least the furry<br />friends love it and there s nothing left in the dish<br />LC
Great taste.  Almonds are high in overall fat but low in saturated fats that most contribute to weight gain.  Buy a case; they stay pretty fresh when sealed for 6 months
Some of the best Haribo's around. They taste like a real mango with a touch of sour on top. When I die and go to Haribo heaven these will be waiting for me. So good!
"I have been using Vetri-Science UT Strength Feline chews for over a year with no problems. This was the first time I got them through Amazon from Absolutely Pets. Sadly, the chews were either old product or a mistake. They were almost rock hard and had to be microwaved for 5 seconds and cut up with a knife before my cat could eat them. I think this is a great product and will continue to use it but hope that the supplier will either refund or replace the bad batch."
"For the longest time I've been looking for something that compares to Illy espresso (medium roast) at a lower price. Thought this was a deal as I've been paying $14+ per can of Illy. I read all the hype & tried to order via Amazon only to be told they will NOT ship this product to Hawaii.I found the Crema e Gusto somewhere else for less than $9/pack; sadly, I was disappointed with the slightly bitter undertone and will most likely go back to Illy. Any Illy addicts out there who found something as good at a lower price?"
"This was the first food I fed my puppy. She's always been skinny and we can leave food out for her to nibble on all day. That is until we switched to a different dog food (Wellness core). As soon she tried her new food she ate the whole bowl! It's only her third day eating the new stuff and she's already visibly gained weight. It's kinda sad to realize that she's just been forcing herself to eat this food.<br /><br />I give it 2 stars because there's nothing wrong with the ingredients that I know of, but make sure your dog is willing to eat this bland food."
"I used these treats to crate train our Maltese puppy.  Four years later he still gets a treat before going into crate.  This is the cheapest place to buy, and one of the only places I've been able to even find the product now. Perfect for small dogs."
this cider tastes & smells pretty good but not the best I've ever had. its very sweet brewed on 8oz but still pretty good when brewed on 10oz is less sweet and a little watery but still tastes ok I like it. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. in the meantime I will be buying this again unless I find a better kind.
Very good coffee beans. Good flavor with all the various types. Would purchase again. The price was right. The smaller packages were also good to keep beans fresh.
"I ordered this chili at the request of my parents.  They ate it in Montanna and loved it.  So said, the chilli was not available in Texas, but I found it at H.E.B. grocery.  It is as good or better than homemade.  Not too spicy but has a good flavor and no nasty meat pieces.  The beans are really good and creamy.  We now have it in our pantry.  I normally do not have canned food but I will keep this in stock.  Really good."
"This has been my favorite movie since I was a little kid. I used to watch it every day! It has perfect casting. This movie has a little of everything-comedy, drama, horror(well sorta).<br /><br />Definitly a must see!<br /><br />~silence~"
"My dogs love this food.  I have fed my 11 year old German Shepard and my three year old American Pit Bull Terrier for almost three years. They have thrived so well on this food, my shepard no longer has stomach problems ... both their coats are beautiful and I am completely satisfied.  When I decided to switch foods, I did alot of research on what good, healthy, mostly organic food to switch them to. I chose Newman's Own, not because I could purchase it easily at a local store .. because I can not do so, I have to order it and have it delivered, but because of the ingredients, how it is made, and because most of the proceeds go to charities. I found the best price at Amazon, and will always order it this way.  I truly recommend this dog food to everyone."
"SIX Reasons to buy this product:<br /><br />1. It's a healthy source of protein you can stash in your pocket.<br /><br />2. It's fun and cool - it's Ostrich!<br /><br />3. It's only 2 weight watchers points<br /><br />4. They say its a good source of potassium (650mg) and iron (?) - I'm not a nutritionist<br /><br />5. If you like salt. I have to say I don't, and Im a bit sad because I want to love this product, but it is too salty for my tastes.<br /><br />6. If you want to drink more water. Seriously these are salty."
A great buy. I've got a small counter space and not a lot of storage all around. Great way to organize and store my coffee.
I take this tea when I feel snuffly like I am just about to get a cold and it does wonders.  I catch no cold and the symptoms disappear within a day.  Brilliant stuff.
"Well to start I don't know why this is under toys when it's a drink.  The bottle is pretty and coll looking but the smell and taste is terrible. Also the horrible taste will stay in your mouth for quite a while. I don't recommend this is you intend to drink it. But I resealed mine and put in on a shelf with the rest of my collectors stuff. Same thing goes for the mana drink, very pretty and cool but the grossest thing you can imagine."
"I bought this chai tea while I was waiting for big train chai latte to be shipped to me. I mixed it with soy milk. It was a good chai tea but not a great one. I love big train chai tea more.For some reason, it leaves a weird taste in my mouth after the last sip."
"Unlike most 40 cent ramen, this has three favor packets, including one that's a liquid. Lots of flavor, good spice. Wish it didnt come in the big plastic container though."
I bought these for making rainbows on top of cupcakes that I had baked for a baby shower. They were awesome. There are 8 strips of candy per pack. I had plenty of extras and the kids loved that. Very brightly colored.
"This Ketchup tastes great, it really does!  You can't tell the difference between this and regular ketchup, and the benefit is that there's only 1 carb per serving and much fewer calories too.  This is great stuff and I am really happy with how great it tastes.  Going Low Carb can be difficult with no condiments, this really helps.  This tastes so good that we've stopped buying regular ketchup and keep this in the fridge now instead since the kids can't tell the difference anyway.<br /><br />This is an item that might be available locally at your big box retailers, if so you can probably find it for less there.  I know it's available in the stores around here.<br /><br />5 stars, great product and great tasting."
"This coconut water showed up with over a year left on it's expiration date and tasted very good.  I consider it a five star product, it was nicely packaged and the water itself was very tasty."
"This coffee is really good.  The pumpkin spice is not too strong and not too weak.  I started off adding pumpkin spice creamer to it, but i actually prefer it black.<br /><br />This makes a great fall coffee!"
"5-Hour Energy is probably one of the best energy drinks out there, and the effectiveness is simply amazing. I'm an vegetarian high school student taking 4 AP courses. Sometimes, I get so loaded with work that I have to go to bed at two or three in the morning and still wake up at seven. Before I used 5-Hour Energy, I'd sometimes doze off or fall asleep in my classes. However, after I used 5-Hour Energy, my life changed. Now, with only 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy, I can power through the school day and swim practice easily without feeling tired at all. My grades rose significantly, and I can actually pay attention in class. Just yesterday, I managed to power through the day with only 2 hours of sleep and 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy. The extra energy that the product gives you is definitely worth the money. The product is simply amazing."
"This is what you have been looking for unless you grind your own annato seeds!  If you're wanting that yellow rice you've had in Miami, Puerto Rico, Brasil, Cuba or a thousand other Latino restaurants, then look no further. I've been using this product for 30 yrs. and it is the same thing, same quality, same mistake free results. All you need now is that unreal rice, onion, garlic, oregano, pepper, salt recipe I've been using passed down from my dear old Brasilian father....hehe....good luck. If you want a copy, send a sase to Chef Doogie 3700 nantucket pkwy, oxnard, ca. 93035"
My dog was not as crazy about this product as I thought she might be.  They are a healthy treat that she will eat after she knows she isn't getting anything else.
"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
"I've bought this before at a local health food store, and thought I would get a better deal from Amazon like I always do, but I found the same item for a lot less at my local grocery store yesterday.  I was very disappointed.....  Check with your local store before you buy it from Amazon."
"I have a beagle puppy that like to chew everything and cries when he doesn't get attention. These treats help with both problems, it keeps him busy so he is not whining and not chewing on anything but his sticks. I love that it is natural as I do not give him any foods or treats with any byproducts. I cannot say that he prefer these treats to others. He eats anything and everything I give him."
"I'm currently having a cup of this coffee right now at the breakfast table before eating (on a relaxed Saturday morning when I can take my time and really enjoy this meal with my wife.)  Before having this cup, I just finished a cup of Hawaiian coffee that was good but wasn't Kona.  This cup was too mild and smooth for my tastes.  I grind all of my coffee beans at home.  I like to have one cup of caffeinated coffee first and then follow this with one cup of decaffeinated coffee every morining.  The caffeinated coffees that I like include Kirkland's Guatemala and Ruwanda and Starbucks French Roast.  I like strong, bold flavorful coffee.  I also like Trader Joe's Seattle Blend and another very dark French roast that they sell.  I like Kirkland's decaff a little better than the decaff that Trader Joe's sells.  I have tried Trader Joe's Italian Roast decaff and liked it.  In general, I feel that decaffineated coffees are somewhat one dimensional in taste.  They have a good flavor, but it just isn't bold enough to suite me.  But, for a person who wants to limit their caffeine intake, both Kirkland's and Trader Joe's brands are pretty good and I recommend them.<br /><br />After grinding my own Starbucks French Roast for about two years now, I cannot drink Folgers or Maxwell House by themselves anymore.  I used to love their darker coffees but now find that they just don't have enough flavor to suit me anymore.  I use two rounded tablespoons of freshly ground coffee and filtered tap water to make my coffee.  On weekends, I use a french press to get a little more flavor out of that first cup of coffee.  Obviously, I'm not an expert on coffees but I know what I like and Kirkland's decaff is pretty good.  Of the caffeinated, I got tired of Starbucks French Roast after a while.  I like the the Guatemala a lot.  I want to try the Mayorca brand soon."
"Now that I'm addicted to this green jasmine tea, what do I do? The Target store nearby no longer carries it. Amazon seems to carry only the smaller bottles. I need the 2 litre bottles!  Nothing else compares. There is no point in trying to find a replacement. Will I live?"
Easy ordering. Found the item easily.  Easy pay. Good product.  As soon as you open the lid the aroma opens up your sinuses!
"This is a great mid morning coffee, best for drinking after I have already had my jet fuel. It is a medium strength coffee, but has great aroma and flavor."
"All of Murray's Sugar Free Cookies are excellent, but my favorite is the Pecan Shortbread.  Delicious!"
Product does as billed and is pleasant to the palate. I get a hint of vanilla with a smokey finish much akin to a smooth cuban cigar perfect to end the night with. Customer Service with Apex was a pleasure even with Fed-Ex delivery errors they made it right.<br />Recommended
This tea smells wonderful and tastes like you are having a treat. I am on Weight Watchers and it is just sweet enough by iteslf to take the edge off any of those nighttime cravings! It is very relaxing to have a cup at bedtime- it tastes better than the original sleepytime. The subscribe and save option means I don't have to worry about running out!
This is a travel must have for my Chocolate Lab Lizzy. As soon as she is in the back of the SUV and the engine is started she is looking for her chew. These chews keep her busy and occupied.
"My cat is pretty picky and I have tried every kind of natural/grain free/expensive wet cat food there is. She typically turns her nose up if she is given the same wet food two days in a row. The Natural Balance pouches are the only wet food that my cat will eat every day without a problem. I bought cases of two flavors and I alternate them every other feeding. We are going on a couple months now and she still loves it. It seems to be a great brand for people who care about natural, high quality ingredients, and for the relatively low price, it can't be beat."
"Kellogg's Special K Dark Chocolate granola bars are tasty, however they are pretty generic. Nothing really stood out and wowed me, however they do taste good in my opinion. The dark chocolate is probably the best part of it. When I first bit into it, it reminded me of a rice krispie treat with chocolate. Instead of rice cereal though, it is made with oats. The box comes with 5 bars so with the price on Amazon, it costs about 75 cents a bar. Each bar contains 110 calories, 4 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, 3 grams of total fat, 85 mg of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. They are pretty sweet so if you aren't a big sweets fan you probably won't like these. It's almost as sweet as a candy bar in my opinion, so it would be a healthier choice if given the option between the two.<br /><br />Overall, they are decent. I'd buy them myself if they were on sale at the grocery store."
"Kettle chips are thicker and crunchier (though greasier at times) than other chips, and the honey dijon flavor is great.  They don't have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have, and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack."
"This food is great. I have two dogs, a golden retriever and a Shih Tzu Brussels Griffon mix and they both love it. My Brussels was a 1 year old rescue dog and he wouldn't eat the Iams dog food we had so I researched food and found this one. I decided to give it a try. My golden went blind less then a year ago and gained a lot of weight(it's one of the side effects of his disease SARDS) so I wanted to see if this would help at all.... Well guess what! My golden has lost weight and his coat looks healthier after 1 month 1/2 of eating the food and my Brussels loves it too. I highly recommend this food! On a side note we watched my in-laws 14 year old dog and she hardly eats her wet pedigree dog food. She pushes it around a lot, so I gave her a few pieces of the taste of the wild to see what she would do and guess what she ate it all then barked at me for more!"
"Halo makes great food. Good ingredients. Safe and healthy! My cats leave the veggies for last, but always come back and eat them. I put them on a can food only diet. They are loosing the extra pounds I could not get off any other way!!!"
"It's hard for me the believe this myself but so far I have given 8 Keurig coffee makers away (five model B40s, two B60s and two B70s) as gifts and I always give this sampler to go along with the k-cups included with the machine.  I feel that it includes a very good selection of coffees and teas.  If someone does not like a particular beverage (some people NEVER drink tea for instance) the recipients have found that they can keep them on hand for guests.  This does not include all of my favorites but it does have a very good mix.  Here are some of the most popular:<br /><br />Hazelnut:  I don't know why but most of the women in my family (and many  of the men) LOVE this one.<br />Rain Forest Espresso:  If a person likes a full bodied coffee then this could be the one for them.<br />Breakfast Blend:  A milder, medium blend that a lot of people enjoy.<br />Chinese Green Tea:  This is becoming more and more popular in the US and my friends who drink tea like this K-Cup.<br />English Breakfast Tea:  A classic.<br /><br />And the not-so-popular ones:<br /><br />Italian Hot Lemon Beverage:  I have personally never met someone who liked this one.  I am sure that someone does, just no one that I know.<br />Italian Blend:  I usually like an Italian coffee but this one is not popular with my friends, family and guests for some reason.<br /><br />There are others in this pack but in my experience these are the ones that the people in my life usually love and the ones that they avoid."
"I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011)."
"I put a TB of these in my chocolate raw smoothies (I use cacao powder for the chocolate flavor) They add a nice little texture of chocolate bites. Keep in mind these are NOT sweet. So don't overuse.<br /><br />Nancy Rector<br />Author of ""A Painful Truth - The Entrapment of America's Sick""<br />(How Being Ill Got Me Arrested)"
"This is my new favorite cereal. I had given up cereal when I cut way back on carbs. Plus, most of them were just full of sugar anyway. When I decided to add some healthier carbs back into my diet I was looking for a healthy cereal with protien and fiber, but without sugar. I love cutting up a banana and topping my cereal with it. That way I don't have to add any sugar or sugar substitutes. Ocassionally I use stevia if I don't have any bananas or other fruit."
"Why does the ingredients list prominently feature sorbitol and xylitol?  With the stevia, that's 3 sweeteners!!!  And sorbitol causes painful gas and bloating.  Want a gum sweetened ONLY with stevia.  Does that product exist?"
there is not much one can say about Hawaiian punch.  my kids love it.  the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles.  i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own.  i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future Hawaiian  punch needs.
"My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these ""edible chews,"" so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones ""chewy"" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though)."
"I like the single-serving bags, and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought, but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.<br /><br />They are crunchy, and have a decent texture, but they're saltier than I'd prefer.  They're what I reach for when I want something salty, or when I'm just bored with the rest of the snacks on hand.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can tell a difference between the Nacho flavor rounds and the ""plain"" ones."
The Bisquick Complete is great. I work and live overseas and ordering this product made life so simple to deal with after a hard day at the office.  The freshness and tender touch make anyone I serve them to appriciate the great taste.<br />Thank you for making this item one of the best on the market and for making my life a more simple one.
I was very happy with my order.  It arrived on time and as described.  Thank you!!
"They work great!<br />This is instant coffee but it's good, not great but good.<br />Better than most not as good as some.<br />small individual packages, easy to take with you.<br />mild flavor not to strong.<br />About average cost."
"Last night my family tried the Patak Tikka Masala sauce.  Boy, that was good! Tonight, we tried the Patak Tandoori Paste-- and, yes, that was good, too!<br /><br />The paste is very easy to use.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast.  I mixed 8 -10 tbsp of this paste with 6-7 tbsps of plain yogurt and marinated for several hours.  Then, I baked the chicken for about 1/2 hour and it's done!  It's rare when I serve a meal that everyone in my family likes, but I've now served 2 meals in a row that everyone in my family raved about!<br /><br />I served this with couscous and a salad.  Very quick, easy, and very very good!"
Ritter Sport has prepared a great combination for white chocolate lovers like myself who also like the texture of crunchy nuts in their white chocolate.  The white chocolate is top notch and the Hazel nuts are always fresh.
Great formula.  Helped with my newborn spit up and gas issues.  Plus it contains probiotics to help with the immune system.
I'm not a morning person and I need my morning coffee!  I got this coffee at a great price and it was delivered as promised.  Caribou Coffee was just the thing I needed for my mornings to get started.  Using the K-cups was very convenient and made brewing coffee quick and easy.
"The Oat and Honey clusters reminds me of the granola cereal that I used to love as a kid, but this has much less fat and still tastes great.  It's gluten free on top of it!  Since I am Celiac, my breakfast cereal choice is somewhat limited.  I was looking for something different to break up the monotony and decided to give this a try.  I am glad I did.  The only downside to this is that it is a bit expensive.  I think it is worth it though.  I just ordered the Maple Walnut clusters and looking forward to trying them."
Walkers Royal Toffees is a fine quality product that we enjoy very much. We first experienced these toffees at a retail store that we frequent. We tried to find a way to purchase some for aouselves which proved rather difficult. We did a serch on the internet and found they could be obtained through Amazon.com. After several attempts due to availability shorages we were able to succsesfully completre an order and was able to receive them.<br />We highly recomend this product.
"I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas; this is a great addition to my current mix.  The tea bags make it easy to enjoy at work."
My dog absolutely loves these treats.  Sometimes I offer him other treats and he may turn away from them but he never refuses these treats!
I've ordered this product a couple of time. Both orders were past their sell dates...FOUR MONTHS OLD. Bought in November product had a July date. Food was discolored. For a dollar more a box you can purchase at TRADER JOE's.
"Delicious! If you cook them according to the instructions, you will have a wonderful pasta substitute! I use these in casseroles too. Enjoy!"
"Bought this for a gift - box (wood grain tea chest""?) arrived in poor condition.  Other than that - nice assortment of teas."
"While I understand they are a little sweet...they taste sooo good!  My coworker hated them...so it's really about personal taste on this one...you seem to either love them or hate them... though I have to say, they taste really good when you separate them..eat the center a little by little and a bite of chocolate with it..yum"
"this is possibly... no definitely, the absolute best tasting honey i have ever had. i have obviously never had real honey, bc this is unlike anything else i have had."
I was very pleased with my latest order of Biscotti.  I will definitely by this product again.  Everything arrived in perfect order.
"One must know that this dieter's tea helps mostly by moving your bowels along.  Be careful at first, or it will be unpleasant!"
This is good pantry pasta for lazy days.<br />All you need to do is boil the pasta then make or buy a sauce.
"My 2 year-old LOVES these. They are kinda sweet-tart, which I happen to prefer over the super-sweetness of other brands. Plus, I feel a little better about letting my son have these as a snack. Even though they are more expensive than other brands, the amazon subscribe-and-save price makes it worth the extra money."
"I LOVE these.  I make them, cut, wrap and them and freeze them.  Zap in the microwave and you will have the best brownie ever!!!"
We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!
"These are so yummy....large, fresh roasted flavor, just a touch of sea salt....must have eaten half of the first bag upon opening... ...may have to place an extra order...I am definiately on autoship!"
"This oatmeal is great, its hearty and filling and tastes great, I eat it for breakfast almost everyday, sometimes for dinner too when Im in a pinch and need something quick and healthy. I change it up by adding fruit or a sprinkle of plain cinnamon (not cinnamon sugar!). I will continue to buy it, not sure if Amazon has the cheapest price though."
i just got those nuts a week ago. my husband loves those snacks so much! i also use some dark chocolate turn those nuts to health candy.<br /><br />i will continute to order when i finish this order.<br /><br />you really should try it.
"Amazon clearly has stacks of these just sitting around at a warehouse for months! These bars were chalky, so they tasted old. Besides that though, I don't know how much I would've like these bars anyway. I mean I love anything peanut butter, but these bars just didn't cut it. They tasted like cardboard. Sure, the box I got was old, but I can't imagine the taste being much better when fresh. Allow me to suggest a couple of other bars that I do like, 'pure protein' bars or my favorite 'supreme protein' bars."
"If my cats don;t get tgus fir breaJfast tget are syre ti ket ne jbiw quite strudebtly at that.<br />Unfortunately,they don;t love all the flavors equally so I do wish they would sell the flavors separately if possible."
"The best store bought brownie mix. Just add oil, water, 1 egg, and set it for 40 minutes. Anyone can do it! Taste great, not sweet, little bitter, just perfect. Don't overcook it, it should be slightly wet when ready and once it sits for 1-3 hours to dry out, it will be perfect."
"I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin ""chocolate vehicle""--i.e., cookie."
"I used to use this brand all the time and loved it, but they've changed their formula.  The latest is marked ""gluten free"" and has virtually no heat and little taste.  Now I'm searching for a new brand."
"Better than any other ""gummi"" type products on the market.  Just takes quite a while to make it across the pond to our country."
"Now why would the description say it's a great alternative to milk when it contains milk by products!?! Annoying! Now I have to waste time returning it.<br />Update: This company was extremely difficult to deal with. They argued with me about it containing milk when it says right on the ingredient list that it contains a ""milk derivative"". When I refused to pay for return shipping they claimed to not know how to give me a shipping label. Their email responses did not even make sense much of the time, nor were they timely. After 15 emails and almost a month of being patient I had to file a claim with Amazon to get my money returned. Amazon credited my card within a couple of days and I'll just give the product to a food bank. This was not my usual experience in dealing with Amazon merchants. They are usually much better."
"To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
"We used the seasoning last weekend to make some hamburgers. Man, that was the best hamburger I've ever had! This will definitely be a staple in my pantry."
"We normally brew a full pot of coffee in our home each morning as there are enough coffee drinkers to make it worthwhile. But in the afternoon, sometimes one of us wants a cup and it is not worthwhile to brew another pot or grind up the beans to make a smaller pot. That's what we have our Senseo for. We keep a couple different kinds of pods around to suit various tastes, and this one suits mine.<br /><br />These are a little stronger, and more full-bodied than the basic medium roast Senseo pods, yet the flavor is not quite as acidic as their dark roast pods. I use one pod for a ""double"" serving (the button with the 2 cups), which is (I know) not the recommended way, but I still seem to get good results. If I happen to be making one first thing in the morning and need a little more strength, I will use 2 pods and press the double first, and then the single to get a slightly larger and stronger cup."
"Caffeine can often be a problem for me and I often like to have a comforting cup of tea in the evening.  I have tried most of the decaffeinated black teas out there and most are poor quality and/or very weak.  I'm not overly fond of herbal ""teas,"" Earl Grey or green teas and this is the best decaffeinated black tea I've found, at least readily available in the States.  Though not as strong as the equivalent caffeinated Twinings version, it is pretty close and has a lovely full-bodied flavor without bitterness.  If you like your tea on the stronger side, simply allow a minute or so longer steeping time on this one(I tend to drink mine brewed strong with a bit of milk).<br /><br />I admit there are caffeinated black teas (including several loose teas) that I prefer over this one, but based on a lot of searching, this is the best of the decafs and I'm glad it's available for an evening cuppa. I still think there is room for improvement in this product area, but this one is pretty good and is definitely a step above the rest of the field."
I'm not sure what i was expecting but the taste isnt something that makes me want to take another one an the effect of the product isnt anything i felt. unfortunately i would not recommend this product
"Very good coffee, not too bold, but rich.  Took a long time to ship, so order early!"
This tea is great. I drink some every day and it keeps my tummy happy and my spirits uplifted. The aroma is very nice. The size of the bag is enormous! I have never seen such a large bag of loose leaf tea!
"These were kind of expensive for a dog treat and two of my dogs wouldn't even touch them, so I doubt I would buy them again."
"I (like another review that I read) enjoyed this tea while staying at a 4-star hotel recently.  I just loved it and was sorry there was only one in the 'coffee/tea' wooden box available in my room.  I saved my tea wrapper/package (well wrapped for freshness) and I immediately looked it up on Amazon to order for home use. I wasn't surprised that it was a little more expensive than the usual tea bags, but it was WELL WORTH IT.  The Pepperment is subtle and aromatic.  The plus is that it's decafinated and won't keep you up at night.  I highly recommend it!!"
I really liked the regular so I thought I would try the Chocolate and it's almost as good as the regular smooth. It's just a little more liquid and you need to stir it.
Works great for me and also help me with my weight.  I don't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed.
"Try this one, great decaf and maybe it'll help make you think you're in the tropics."
"I keep a number of jars of this oil around the house.  One is in the kitchen where we use it everywhere we would use butter.  It is great on toast, corn, steamed vegetables, rice, pasta etc.  The other jar is for our skin.  It is wonderful as a bath oil and a lotion.  I put it the whole family from baby to Daddy.  It smells divine, tastes great and is super softening on the skin."
these pods have changed my life. they are so easy to use in my francis francis machine that i now make espresso every day instead of just on the weekends. i have never been able to get such consistent results or crema with beans i ground myself. i highly recommend them
"I have to give my do meds twice a day, and these pockets make it so easy. I prefill  at least a week at a time, and keep them in tuperware. Every morning and evening I say ""Time for medicine."" , and he comes running."
I really did not see that this product hepled me in increasing my milk supply. Not only did it not help me but it has a bitter taste.
Poor product don't waste your money
"I tried these because of a friend's recommendation.  I was weary.  One bite was all it took for me to get hooked.  These are a far more nutritious salty snack than potato chips are.  Sure the taste is different, but I usually grab potato chips when I want something salty, not potato-y.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"
"This is the best tasting of the hordes of noodles I've tried. You name it, I tried it.  I've been eating this particular one for probably about 10 years or so. I once ate this every meal for a whole month. The MSG really gets you after awhile though."
"I was reluctant to try these crackers at first, but once I did, I couldn't believe how delicious they tasted.  They are great for dips because of their firm nature but they are not too hard to chew for those with sensitive teeth.  I cannot wait to try all varieties."
"Best hot sauce, I've ever tried!!! DO NOT BE SKEPTIC about this! Read all reviews on the I-net, before you order. Just ONE DROP will do it! I mean it! I love spicy food, but this sauce can make you cry and sweat and your a*hole won't be happy, trust me!<br />Tabasco is a sweet tea in comparison to Dave's Insanity!<br />Never ever try it on your friends or as a prank! NEVER! Enjoy!"
"I mixed this into a Bulgogi type of recipe.  Decent taste, don't use too much though"
"This stuff was really hard to find!  I really like that it is actual fruit and not just juice, water and sugar.  The price was ok, but the shipping makes it a bit less desirable.  I would love to find a comparable product that is a little more affordable!"
"Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon."
"This is an easy-to-make dish that takes macaroni and cheese to the next level.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Easy prep.  Everything cooks in one pan.  No need to cook noodles separately.  Took 5 minutes to prep and 15 minutes to wait while it simmered.<br />- Makes a lot of food.  Our family of three was stuffed and we still had a lot left over.  This really does make 5 servings.<br />- Flavor is good. This is a comfort food.  The addition of lean ground beef really adds to the flavor.<br />- Nutrition is good if you use extra lean ground beef (except sodium.. see below).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- A little high in sodium (38% RDA / 850mg / serving).  This is very common for these sorts of meals.<br /><br />Other thoughts:  If you use 90% lean ground beef, you get 9g fat per serving, which isn't too bad.  We used 95% so had more like 5g fat per serving (estimate)."
"I'm running low on my dental bones and I've gone to Petsmart, Petco, and Walmart looking for these specific ones. I couldn't find them! I can't remember the place that I found this exact package but I do remember it was almost 30 dollars for it. I am definitely going to repurchase via Amazon after she finishes the rest"
"This is great as a sugar substitute.  I put it on mostly everything, my coffee, cereal and its great on oatmeal!  And you don't need that much."
"It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.  I've even gotten used to drinking it plain without any sweeteners.  A cup sounds pretty good right now!"
"Perfect with leftover Chicken, Fish or ?.  Serve it over rice or plain.  Even makes canned Swanson Chicken a great meal."
"My brother-in-law got me hooked on Bariani Olive Oil. It is terrific.<br /><br />I use it almost every day. It's not like those store-bought brands that are almost gooey and awful tasting....<br /><br />I recommend it for everyone! (Well, not everyone, then I wouldn't have any.)"
"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D"
"My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting. That's a winner."
Fondant started to seperate. May have been due to the weather but even after adding powdered sugar we still could not use it. What a waste.
"Nice caramel apple flavor (its an artificially sweetened powder that completely dissolves and empties out of the k-cup). This can have a somewhat strong/tart flavor on small cup setting, so i run the same k-cup twice on 'small' cup setting in a large mug to dilute it slightly more to suit my taste.  Quick and convenient hot apple cider with caramel touch for those occasions when you crave apple cider, hot or cold  add ice cubes).<br /><br />***update*** noticed my keurig was spurting during brew cycle but only when using this caramel apple cider k-cup.  After making a cup of cider, i decided to cut the foil open on the top of the k-cup.  I discovered this stuff clumps during brewing inside the bottom of the cup as a sticky ball.  It has done it on the second pack as well, so might be product & not just a bad batch. Might be clogging up the discharge needle in the bottom of the k-cup.  Just to check out what's inside, I cut open a new cup and small amuont of brown and white powder is all there is to this."
"I just wanted to add that the product we received was extremely fresh and tasty. We recently bought ground hazelnuts (=hazelnut meal/flour) from one of the online stores, and they smelled and tasted rancid. We had to return them right away.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill hazelnut flour was perfect - very tasty, high quality product.<br />Hazelnut is often used in Europe for cakes and cookies, but for some reason it is not a very popular nut in the US.<br />I will certainly stay subscribed to this product since I cannot locate it in any of the stores in our area.<br /><br />Just a reminder, keep it in your fridge to preserve freshness."
"I returned these because the expiration date was the day I received them.  They were quite expensive but I was willing to pay the price because these are not always available in the local stores. I want to order again but am afraid I might get the same shipment date. If Amazon can check the exp. date before they sent them out, I would order again."
"This is an amazing brand.  I don't like garlic, and they mostly do sauces without it.  It seems the manufacturers of pasta consider garlic to be a centerpiece of their sauce, but in fact, there is no need to stick it everywhere, and the taste is better without it.  The sauces of this brand are the best I tried.  Furthermore, this sauce tastes very flavorful and authentic Italian, where, unlike in the USA, garlic does not permeate every tomato sauce."
"I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many ""bad"" coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor.  You don't have to try them all, this is a perfect blend coffee."
"I occasionally like to add a little flavor to my club soda or mineral water & this gives me a healthy choice. For me it's very sweet, because I really restrict my carb intake. It only takes a couple of drops in a 16 oz. bottle of water, to satisfy me."
We received this product really quickly! It was well packaged and exactly what we ordered.
"If youre on a low cal diet (or any diet!) and you crave chocolate, GET THIS!! You mix 2 tbsp of the powder with 1 tbsp of water.. You can add a little more water if you want a drizzle like consistency for drizzling on desserts or waffles. But otherwise, its super creamy and absolutely delicious! If it isn't sweet enough for you, try to add one packet of splenda or sweet n low! Will buy again and again! Absolutely LOVED it!"
"I've been buying ZICO with mango in 11.2 oz. tetra-paks almost since they started offering them here on Amazon.  However, just as another reviewer explained, the most recent batch I received was horrible, it went from being the best coconut water to the worst I've ever had.  The packaging was slightly different and most alarming, the individual box no longer says anything about being from Brazil.  If this continues I will never buy this product again.  If you are having the same experience, please speak up on here so maybe we can get this fixed......"
"Tastes like lemon chiffon in one's mouth, but texture crumbles and is a bit crunchy (I like).  Messy food, but the wrapper, if one is careful, contains it well.  Filling too.  It's the single best non-dairy snack I've ever eaten."
"I used it for a present and the person loved it. Is growing up ok and the shipping went through without problems to DC. Looks good on top of a table and the ceramic pot matches with almost everything.<br />The only thing I didn't like it's that the ceramic pot doesn't have some stones that can give more support to the bamboo while growing. I didn't think about it when I bought and though is something easy to get and not that expensive, it would improve the presentation."
Very tasty cup of coffee. I like to get the whole bean from Community Coffee. I enjoy many of the different coffees from this company. Good quality and the prices are right.
"Starbucks has outdone themselves on their VIA line of products.  As a full-time medical student, I am definitely a caffeine addict.  Coffee is my drink of choice when I need to stay awake during long stretches in the semester, but I frequently study with classmates that don't drink coffee.  Starbucks VIA packets are the PERFECT solution for me.  I don't need to bring a coffee maker and coffee.  I just pack a few packets into my bag and go.  I must say that I was genuinely surprised at how fresh and full this coffee tastes.  Whenever I make a cup, I'm amazed because I never get that instant coffee bitterness/staleness found elsewhere.  If you like coffee, have an unpredictable schedule, or travel, I highly recommend picking up a pack of Starbucks VIA packets.  You won't be disappointed."
"All products from wilton are absolutely incredible. These are not tiny balls of sprinkles, they are slightly bigger and just what I was looking for for the cake idea I had. A must buy for fabulous ideas. Arrived quickly : ) so that was a plus."
"I love my Keurig and use it every day, several times a day. My mum was born in England and is VERY particular about the taste of her tea. I got her to try this and she really liked it. I love it! True tea lovers will like this tea. It is the only K cup tea I will drink."
"This is some excellent oatmeal!  Steel cut is the way to go--more flavorful and healthier than your Quaker rolled oats.  Preparation is simple as well...no need to go instant.  Just start cooking your oatmeal when you wake up, by the time you shave and shower, you're ready for some wholesome oatmealy goodness!"
This Oolong tea tastes pretty good. This is my favorite Oolong tea that I have purchased from Amazon. I have tried many of them. It has some green leaves and brown as you can see in the pictures of the leaves in the bag that I took.<br /><br />I have used the leaves over and over to make tea. It has a pleasant fragrance upon steeping it with hot water. I'm happy with this tea. It was well worth the cost of it.
this seems like a silly product but if you have hard water it can prolong the life of your dishwasher and make your dishes come out sparkling
This is by far my favorite olive and and it is excellent for dips and dressings!!!
"If you notice, all the bad reviews are from people who seem not to understand there are k cups and there are coffee pods...2 totally different systems. by their inability to read, they create a negative view of this product. The coffee is excellent and much cheaper than k cups. Not sure it is as good as Java One Sumatra coffee but pretty darn close. For those who own pod brewers this is worth a try. For those of you who own keurig k cup brewers be a little smarter and don't knock the product because you can't read or don't know the difference between k cups and coffee pods.It is not the products failure."
This is a nice variety of minature Hershey products.  It is a huge bag (3lbs5oz)and arrived ahead of schedule and fresh.  Will probably end up eating it and ordering more for Trick or Treaters.
After consulting with the seller I can recommend this product. The product is top shelf and it is everything the seller said it was. Freshness and taste is excellent  I will be glad to order this product again
"I love the Flavrz range and this is my favourite flavour.  One sachet will give a great taste to 1 litre (approximately a 32 oz nalgene sized container) for only 70 calories.  I SO appreciate the fact that there are no artificial sweeteners in this - I'm much happier with just the very small amount of sugar, agave and fruit juice which are present here, instead of the acesulfame, aspartame etc which you get in other products.  Tastes great, contains no nasties and hardly any extra calories.  Awesome."
"For strong, well rounded black coffee, Emeril's is just the best!  I won't go back to anything else.  Smooth, non acidic.  My last batch ordered had many pods that ended up ""punctured"" when brewing, so I had grounds in my cup and a dirty machine.  This has only happened once, though, so I must just have a bad shipment.<br /><br />Yummy product!"
Came on time and as described will keep ordering it. Best price that I have found and easy to order.
"I have three dogs, a minpin, a lab, and an aussie pup. My min-pin got sick recently. It was pancreatitis and kidney problems. His liver was a mess too. After he got out of the vet hospital (800 bucks later) they wanted him to eat a prescription food that they sold. He hated it. Would NOT eat it.<br /><br />I got the Wellness through a reccomendation and it has been a life-saver. My minpin is healthy now. His liver is fine, as are his kidneys and pancreas. He looks years younger with his shiny coat. My lab and my pup are looking fabulous as well.<br /><br />Whats ironic is that I WAS feeding a supermarket wet food and it was costing me 90 bucks a month to feed these guys. Now, it's cheaper, they are healthier and they LOVE it. I have never seen dogs freak over dry food like they do over this.<br /><br />If you can afford it, I highly recommend this product. It saves you money in the long run and makes your pets happy and healthy."
"My JRT is very picky and won't eat most treats, but she loves her Greenies and her mom (me) loves how they clean her teeth and breath."
"This was the first Larabar product that I tried, and it was awful!  The bar smelled and tasted like Vicks Vaporub, which is not exactly a pleasant thing when you're talking about food.  I will definitely not be purchasing any of their other products after this awful experience."
"I used to head to my local gas station and purchase the individual bottles at almost 3 bucks a piece. A friend told me that she buys them off amazon and they come out to half price! You can't beat that! I only like to drink energy shots when I am in NEED of a quick pick me up. I dislike having to take red bull, monster and all those drinks because of their size and high sugar content. I like the 5 hour drink because at 2 ounces and 4 calories, and no sugar, I can easily and conveniently throw it back and get on with my agenda. However, it does NOT last 5 hours, not for me at least. I drink it 20 minutes before an activity and I can get through it just fine, but maybe 2 hours or so tops. I'm satisfied with it, because that's normally all I need."
"I have recently developed a taste for these chewy/crunchy/powdery/nerdy candies.  I love them.  Purchasing them here is quick -- they arrived in two days, as promised, and easy!  I will definitely order from you again.  Thanks.<br />Robyn"
"I have an 11 year old Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. I've been giving her Dentastix for over 9 years. She absolutely loves them. I started giving her these for oral care. I can't brush her teeth because I've got a chronic pain condition that effects my dexterity. I gave her ""Beggin Strips"" for a treat. After a few months, she stopped wanting the ""Strips"" and only wants the Dentastix. I checked with her Veterinarian and she said they are safe to give her more than 1 or 2 a day.<br /> I was hospitalized 9 years ago for 3 weeks and she stayed with relatives. When we both got home, her bathroom habits were all messed up. To fix things, I started to give her half a Dentastix when she went where she was suppose to. After a couple of weeks, her bathroom habits were corrected. The only problem was now, instead of going to the bathroom 2 to 3 times a day, she either pees a little or defecates the size of a penny whenever she wants a Dentastix.<br /> As far as their effectiveness as a tooth cleaner, she has never needed her teeth cleaned. They are in perfect health. I should know, I was a Dentist before I became ill.<br /> I get them sent every 2 months to make sure the are fresh. Having them sent automatically also saves a few dollars."
"This stuff does give you an energy boost and I believe (with proper diet and exercise) it will speed your weight loss.  But, I suggest you get capsules, because this stuff is disgusting otherwise."
"The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic."
"These are good-tasting, as advertised.  My one caution would be don't eat too many a day, or at least space it out with something binding."
I recently wanted to make a batch of sloppy Joe's using a recipe  that I haven't used for 40 years. It was absolutely the best thing for kids parties when I was growing up. I could not find the vital ingredient-Heinz India Relish anywhere. Thanks Amazon.com for carrying all these wonderful products.  Now I can pass this recipe on to my grandkids.
"I placed an order for six of these several days ago and they arrived two days ago.  These preserves are outstanding and probably the best that I have ever eaten.  As a result, we have placed orders for several different flavors.  This is a good time to try them out with the special incentives and Amazon was by far the best price I found anywhere."
This is nice for making the broccoli tops in my Chinese take out cupcakes.  The greens are different shades of dark green.
I've been using this product for the past few months and I've seen a difference in my health. It makes me more calm in stressful situations and it keeps me regular. I love the taste - it's just like drinking raspberry soda on a daily basis!
For low price and great taste this product is worth to get.  Incredible taste and aroma.  This is the only product i would purchase. it beats out green mountain coffee.
"This product is a dream come true and I haven't even used it in recipes yet.  I love mixing up a small bowl to go, and eating it with sliced apples as a snack.  It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...  Again, LOVE this product."
"This product is excellent, and fairly priced.  I am very happy with the taste and quality.  It's very gourmet!<br />This kind of salt is good for you!  Of course, moderation is the key."
"I really enjoy these bars.  I ordered the cashew-almond bars as well, but much prefer the cranberry/almond.  The cranberry just adds that extra bit of flavor, plus I have a sweet tooth.  I am a borderline diabetic, and I like how these bars are low-glycemic. The last thing I need is a sugar rush."
This is awesome! It's so much better for you than regular soda. It actually perks you up when you drink it and you want to share it with others. So good for you. Drink up to your health!
"Lses expensive than the lowest local price, all four cans arrived in perfect condition, and the ""sell by"" date is more than a year-and-a-half in the future. Excellent.<br /><br />To those very few who received damaged cans, I suggest you contact Amazon. Their return/refund policy is among the best. Arrange for the return online, print a prepaid UPS label, and it's picked up at your house."
"I drink a lot of iced tea and this was some of the best I've had!  I will be buying it again, and again!!"
"Some find the orange taste too strong. I don't. They are a bit pricey for cookies, but the Amazon price is good. Not for compulsive eaters, though--half a cookie is 130 calories."
This is the topping used by my local R**al Theater Chain and I love it! I've seen blogs on this topping and could not find a source for it until now. Great Stuff.<br />Delivery was quick too. I was suprised. Thanks for offering this to the consumer.
"Googled ""best hot/chili sauce in the US"" the other day and Huy Fong Sriracha popped up. I read that this brand is one of the best hot chili sauce so I figured I would give it a try. I was hoping that a supermarket near my apartment would sell this brand, and to my delight it does.<br />I understand now why this is one of the best hot chili sauce out there. man! its so spicy and hot that I must have drinking water near me all the time I'm eating this sauce. Not only I like the spiciness, it has a little garlic taste to it too. Plus the squeeze bottle is a plus. I'm never gonna buy different brands again. This will do."
This is the most tasty protein bar I have ever had. I introduced to people at work and some of them just get hooked. It is not as chalky as other and tastes like real chocolate wafer.
"got as gift from friends who traveled to australia. definitely has a kick, but also has an incredible taste. looking here on amazon to see if we can get it for a reasonable price. clearly for this much, i think i'll travel to australia to buy it! perhaps i'll find it cheaper elsewhere."
"These are probably the best-tasting potato chips ever. Chips certainly aren't the healthiest snack food out there, but at least these don't have any trans fats."
My little one loves these and you cannot beat the subscribe & save price!  It's a better price than any sale at a retail store!
"I'm on the HCG diet and these drops are great! I use them daily in my tea but one of my favorite things to do is use the orange flavored ones on a half of a grapefruit, I feel like I'm eating a real treat! They do not taste as sweet as Splenda, but they are a lot better for you!"
"What a surprise! The truffle salt  I ordered was cheaper than it is at my local Whole Foods. It arrived so fast that I could not understand what could possibly be in the package! It said Paul Butler in the return address, which gave me no clue. What wonderful treats are in store for me! I will toast some good bread, spread a nice helping of smoothly mashed avocado to which I have added a soupçon of lemon juice and a slight sprinkle of the truffle salt.  Some black bread, even untoasted, is good this way! I look forward to the next delivery that says Paul Butler in the return address . A great seller!"
"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!"
"I received my starter and it worked exactly as it should. Due to my mistake, it ended up w/mold. I contacted the company and they offered to send a new one at no charge. Really a great company and a great product. I did my research prior to ordering and am glad this is who I chose."
"I've tried this a couple of time and both times the noodle just fell apart.  The taste was rather sweet, not like regular pasta.  Now searching for some better pasta substitute."
"How do you make $400 Million dollars a year with 1 product? Sell imported irradiated, pasteurized ""fruit juice(?)"" as a nutritional supplement.<br /><br />Where are the ingredients on this product? Shouldn't they be listed on this page?<br /><br />My chiropractor pressured me into buying a $40. bottle of ""Xango."" I got out my magnifying glass so I can tell you the  ingredients: citric acid, natural flavor, pectin, xanthum gum, sodium bensoate. Citric acid, yum, natural flavor,yum, pectin to thicken it up, and irratiated xanthum gum, and sodiom benzoate, an ingredient in fireworks which is used as a preservative, which combined with ascorbic acid (vit c such is found in fruit) forms benzene a known carcinogen. The additive sodiom benzoate is also thought to contribute to hyperactivity in children.<br /><br />Like I said, I bought a bottle of this to please my chiropractor, drank it at the medium dosage, and as I was finishing the bottle, fell sicker than I have been in years, with summer cold and flu symptoms.<br /><br />Well there's a sucker born every minute. I'd pay $40. for a bottle of something to cure my gullibility."
"I am so happy to have discovered these chips. I hate stealing a phrase from another product, but they melt in your mouth. I have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.Just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag, air popped chips. Do try them people!"
"In the past, I have absolutely hated pop tarts. I just couldn't imagine why someone would actually eat them. However, my girlfriend loves them, and things were running a bit tight on the grocery expenses front. I certainly wasn't in a position to start buying Ben and Jerry's. These took the place of such expensive gourmet treats. I figured that $8.53 for 48 of these thingys made it a cheap way to stretch our dollars for a week.<br /><br />I think the Amazon description said assorted flavors. We received strawberry and brown cinnamon. Maybe different shipments have different flavors, but I wasn't going to argue given heir low cost. We received four boxes. Each box has six foil packets. Each packet has two tarts.<br /><br />OK, OK, I actually dug into these before my girlfriend. Properly toasted, they're pretty decent. The pastry shell (I guess I can call it that) was not overally doughy or pasty. The filling tasted the way the box said. A single pack of two is reasonably filling as a dessert.<br /><br />Kids and pop tart afionados would probably give these five stars. Given the fact hat I really had expected a one-star treat, I think the four I'm giving this is pretty good."
"I have a 10 1/2 year old chow-shepard mix... a big girl about 95 pounds.  She started showing some signs of something hurting her as she laid or sat down and then when getting back up.  She didn't have a lot of energy to play or to go for a walk.  The Vet said she's getting arthritis we should try to give her some supplements.<br />We came across these at a mega-pet store and bought a package.  I've followed up with two more and about to buy another to be the fourth month of this experiment.<br />Does this work?  Well, for our dog, she no longer moans as she's lying down or getting up.  She's running around the house again, running in the yard after the squirrels and if we get anywhere near her leash, she's trying to get it off the hook for us to go, go, go.<br />Miracle?  Maybe.  Right product at the right time for my `pup'?  Yes indeed.<br />Do I recommend?  To every dog owner I know; and tell them Amazon has the best price too."
"very easy to use, tastes good in coffee, and nice that doesn't need<br />refrigeration"
"Theses are great, I think I have only had one meal I did not use these on sense I bought them. The bottle was packed full, believe it was more than 2 ounces. I also received 2 free dried ghost chilies."
"the quality  of the product is great! The metallic wrapping will keep it fresh forever.<br />I suffer from migraines, and this has been the only thing that helps, it beats any over the counter<br />and prescription meds. I take one teaspoon with 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and within 15 minutes my pain is gone<br />also works wonders on my joints and muscle pain.<br />now I'm a believer on natural remedies, I was by far the most skeptical person, and had long arguments with my brother about it! I will only believe in what the doctor will prescribe, and was I wrong!!!<br />if you suffer from headaches or arthritis give this a try!! it does not taste bad at all."
"I love supporting family businesses and was pleasantly surprised to discover the Fog Chaser K-cups provide an excellent cup of coffee. I love my Keurig, and I also love a good cup of coffee in the morning and the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company doesn't disappoint. Their coffee is just as flavorful, if not more, than the big brand coffee chains. I will definitely be buying more Fog Chaser and also trying some of their other coffees!"
"I've been looking for this sauce in supermarkets for ever, SO glad to find it on Amazon at a good price. Country Sweet is definitely one of the things I remember fondly of my Rochester days!"
"The title says it all. For a gluten free mix, the cookies are a bit lacking but the cake that this package makes (with sour cream) is absolutely amazing. I routinely make it for pot lucks and such so I know I can eat desert... and everyone asks if I'm sure I can eat it- no one realized it's gluten free!"
very happy with product. It was shipped right away. When it arrived it was in great shape. Nice and fresh tasting . I appreciated the fact I could get this in 96 kcup size.
"When I decided to give my cats canned food I tried this excellent canned food but none of my four cats cared for it.  The food would sit there and they would sniff it and turn their noses.  I gave it four stars because the ingredients are excellent.  Three of my cats liked the wellness canned food, and the last one only likes dry food."
"I am using a Senseo machine so this was a nice product to use it with.<br />The box is large and has a slot you can open at the bottom to get one bag at a time, like a dispenser.<br />The bags are individually wrapped in sealed envelops which can be a pain in a neck to tear open.<br />Taste wise, this coffee is the best testing I have ever tried with my Senseo machine.<br />On a side note, the coffee beans are not Jamaicans but Ethiopians. It is 100% Arabica.<br /><br />Every bag is thicker than the norm so it is large enough for a double coffee."
"My husband and I have tried these rubs on various things now. On the bottle it gives you the type of ""meat"" it would be good to use on, whether it be ribs, fish, whatever. I'm here to tell you you will want to experiment as these ""bbq rubs"" are good on so much more! My husband likes to put them on everything(including vegetables and in soups and chili)!"
"I've used this stuff for years.  As far as it getting in your nose/mouth whatever, hold it close to the ground and sprinkle a small amount on the holes. It's not to be used inside and only on the ant holes/mounds themselves. A year ago they pulled it off the shelves in my local hardware and big box stores. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Can't wait to get back to something that actually works!  Thanks Amazon!"
"It's true, I can't find it anywhere, but I visited a teeny town in Maine in 2005 and they had it! Our local Walmart used to carry it (nc) but hasn't for 4 years. But I'd rather just buy it this way and get as much as I want! This is the best, so much better than Kraft original. :)"
"I am not an 'espresso' expert by any means, but do like a good cup now and then.  This product fit the bill in that regards, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was rich and smooth, not overbearing or too strong.  The Nescafe maker that goes with this coffee is a gem, and if you love coffee and trying different things, I would recommend trying this flavor.  It is our household's favorite flavor overall of the five  we have tried."
"This light roast is absolutely delicious.  I normally buy dark roasts, but my husband wanted me to get some lighter roast K-Cups for him.  I was was so pleasantly surprised at how much flavor this coffee has.  I would highly recommend this."
"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger."
"My dog did not like this food much at all.  A lot of the other reviews I read stated that it helped their dogs w/ itching and flaky skin, didn't help mine at all. For me, it was a waste of money. Every time I put it in his bowl, he looked at me w/ a sad look in his eyes as if he was begging for something else."
My son loved to eat this. Easy to use and take with you. Also a great way to get them to eat meat.
I got my order super fast - great product - plus it helps me sleep straight thru the night :)
"The color on these was bright and they stuck well to my buttercream without bleeding.  One cupcake I still had after 6 days did have some bleeding on the red ones but in my experience, cupcakes usually don't last that long!"
"You can by at Kroger at half the price. Used to be cheaper before recent price hike, just continued from innertia to order until payed attention, people be careful!"
"These are great, they taste like the best apple pie you have ever eaten.  At 70 calories they are a healthy and low fat for adults too!"
These tasty little treats are great for a lunchbox or a hike. They are tender and savory - what more can you ask from an olive??
"Bottles arrived on time and in good condition. Marmite is a love it or hate it affair. If you have lived in the UK or Australia, you would have come across it. I have it on toast with butter, but it's also good as a drink (tastes like strong soup stock) or for use in dishes with mushrooms because it has that dark, earthy flavour."
very good cinnamon taste -- beautiful red in color for most of them are a pink color & don't look very good when used for toppings
"Postum was a grain beverage that was the answer to coffee for people who didn't drink caffeine beverages.  My dad drank postum all the time for breakfast or weekends.  The great thing back in those days (1970s) was that even us kids (5 of us) would drink it with him.  It doesn't have that pungent coffee smell but it was soooo good to us kids.  A little milk and sugar made it look like a creamy cup of coffee, add a bagel and donut-YUMMY!. I drank it up until it was discontinued November of 2007.  What a real retro memory."
"After only a few cups in a couple days, I began noticing an increase in my supply when pumping. Rather than 1-2 oz or less at a session, I began getting 3-4 oz. I had started taking a fenugreek supplement a few weeks prior, which helped as well. I don't pump a lot--just enough to run errands or let dad help with overnight feedings, but this really improved the quality and speed with which I could pump. Maybe it's the placebo effect, but this along with staying hydrated and eating balanced meals is a winner in my book.<br /><br />As for the taste--it SMELLS stronger of anise than it tastes. I find it mild and pleasantly herbal with a splash of whole milk and a little sugar. I make it two tea bags at a time in a standard Copco travel cup. I can see though why some might find the taste bad--it depends on how strongly you oppose the licorice flavor. (I don't like licorice that much but this was fine.)<br /><br />I think the case deal here on Amazon is probably one of the best around--I haven't found it cheaper locally."
Try this in any of your chocolate recipes and you will not regret it!  It changes a recipe from a nice chocolate something to a fantastic chocolate something!
We needed to replace the gluten-free crackers our daughter was eating with something corn free and these fit the bill.
SIMPLY DELICIOUS & A GOOD NIGHT TIME SNACK.<br /><br />ORGANIC POPCORN IS THE BEST WAY OF SNACKING !<br /><br />YOU CAN'T TASTE THE OLIVE OIL USE NOR THE SEA SALT.
"Tastes like Blueberry muffin and coffee without the muffin. My opinion is that its better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, but not as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XSM"">Green Mountain Coffee Caramel Vanilla Cream, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>. It's all a matter of opinion, and all of these Green Mountain flavored coffees are mild with artificial flavors. It boils down to, would you rather have a blueberry muffin or french toast drenched with maple syrup with your coffee? Try 'em all, and pick your favorite is my suggestion. Also, check out the other flavors to see which is lower priced and take turns."
"have tried many flavored popcorn's and usually am not impressed with the claims made by the company about their product, this is different, this really is a great flavored popcorn, the bar-b-q flavor is not too strong nor is it too weak,  this has become our favorite popcorn, thank you POP Weaver, oh yeah, these 3 bag boxes are at Wally World for $1.00 a box, buy-pop-enjoy"
"I use this to make frappes at home by blending 2 tablespoons of it with non fat milk, ice and a packet of Starbucks French Roast Via.  Tastes just as good or better than your local coffee store and is less than half the cost.  This product is great!"
I had been dieting and missing so much the great flavor I was used to with flavored creamers for my coffee. I am one of those people who like a little coffee with a whole lot of other stuff. I had tried several flavors of stevia but the flavor vanilla creme did it for me. I had been making hazlenut coffe and adding vanilla but could not get that cream flavor untill this product. If I close my eyes I can imagine it is my old coffe with lots of cream flavor!!!! Thanks for product.

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.

Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

the best decaf so far ive tried many brands so far no bitter taste but still good robust taste no after taste
"I bought this because it is good quality and it was on sale.  However, ingredients are not listed as organic and so generally it is pretty pricy. Dogs like it.  I'm hoping it is better than the run-of-the-mill type."
I don't eat many sweets but I will have a chocolate chip cookie every now and then. Poppie's cookies are incredible. Impossible to have only one though so watch out.
"These were pretty good. Nice coconut flavor but with that lousy fake ""Fudge Shoppe"" chocolate Keebler uses. They do taste kind of like the Girl Scout Samoas, but I didn't detect much if any caramel and with the sub par chocolate I don't really agree with people who say they're as good as Samoas.<br /><br />They were fresh though, with good flavor and cookie part was still crunchy. Overall I liked these, but don't expect the flavor or richness of the Girl Scout cookies."
"My little boy is nearly two and has become an extremely picky eater.  The peas and carrots he used to love just get thrown on the floor and the little chunks of squash I give him - he spits them out and makes himself gag!  So, these pouches are my salvation!  I mix the powder with a little milk into macaroni and cheese and voila!  Now he eats macaroni and squash and cheese or macaroni and peas and cheese and we are both happy :)  The squash is also great mixed into spaghetti sauce.  It's just an added bonus that they can sit in the pantry without going bad for weeks or months so I always have some veggies on hand for him."
"I was a little skeptical at first but this honey got rid of a chronic skin rash that plagued me for months.It took about 2 weeks for it to completely disappear and when it flares up now I put the honey on it immediately and it usually prevents it from spreading. It's a little sticky but I rub it in as much as possible. After trying steroid creams and every thing else under the sun, I could not believe that manuka honey could solve this problem. Fantastic!"
"We've tried chicken, cheese, and peanut butter. Sometimes the cookies are very small hearts and other times they are large hearts with chunks of oatmeal stuck in them. The smaller cookies are more tender and the large ones are a little harder to break apart. My dog isn't picky, so he's never had problems eating these."
"I tried the black box based on input from a friend who is a golf course greenskeeper. He uses them with great success  to eliminate moles on his golf course. Remove surface dirt from mole mound and dig down into the dirt with a hand shovel to locate the tunnel. Locate the tunnel holes on each side of the hole you have dug out and dig enough dirt  to be able to put 2 black boxes back to back into the hole you have dug. Be sure that the black box opening is even with the tunnel floor and  right up against the mole tunnel hole on each side of the hole you have dug. Set the trap (similar to setting a mouse trap) and put soil loosely over the set traps to keep the light out but don't pack  the soil down. When the little bugger moves through that tunnel,  ZAP .... you got him!! There are are instructions for use on the box also."
"I'm a fan of all kinds of teas so it's easy to give them a thumbs up.  The single pouches are what I use to take with me to work or camping which cuts down on space AND lets me share with others easier.  Great product at home or on the go for sure.  They do have strings, staples and paper tags which is why I only gave it a 4 star.  Eliminate those wasteful parts and they're a five star for sure."
"I love these noodles - they are perfect for taking to work, etc. I found myself looking in Amazon Grocery because I was trying to find this flavor again, as my local store stopped carrying them. The taste is not restaurant-perfect but is much better than all the other instant Asian food products out there I have tried. Cooking is easy. One suggestion - after the second microwaving (there are 2 steps) I let them sit for 10 minutes before I start and the consistency is perfect."
"coconut manna wish container was larger...i use it to make coconut manna balls..they are very delicious...order from amazon.com 15 oz container..it is delicious by it self coconut is a good fat helps the body in many ways...it is fiber, it is sweet naturally, it helps lower lipids in body..love the product"
"This is going to read like another ad for the company, but rarely have I been so completely satisfied by a product. I was specifically looking for dried bhoot jalokia (ghost) chilis that I could grind myself for a variety of uses. I had never purchased from this company before and was concerned that the peppers would be leathery and not really dry enough for my grinders to work correctly. No worries! These chilis were exactly what I was looking for. They were perfectly dried and I was able to grind them very easily into the different consistencies that I need for my various uses (jerky, salsas, etc.) The peppers are first rate: the flavor is awesome - the perfect intense flavor and incredible heat. It is obvious that they started out with only the finest fresh chilis and dried them to perfection. Not only that, but the delivery was faster than promised and the packaging was excellent as the peppers arrived in perfect condition. There is no question where I will go when I need to replenish my supply. If you need perfectly dried chilis of the highest possible quality, look no farther. You will NOT be disappointed."
"Good, strong cup of Java and not bitter like Starbucks. However, not very smooth so I can think of better."
having experimented with several hot sauces over several years including pyro diablo and snakebite habanero extract i can confidently say that this is the tastiest and hottest sauce i have ever used.  my only regret is that it is that it is nearly impossible to apply in small enough quantities leaving my eyes bleeding after every use.  perfect 5
"These popchips(original flavor)are great tasting, low in fat, and a snack that is satisfying. With free shipping and handling with amazon prime they are now at a price I will order and reorder.  With my son's food allergies I am so happy they contain all allowable ingredients!!  Thanks Amazon."
"This is the best tasting of the low acid coffees, and it really feels as if it is lower in acid than regular coffee.  Wish it were up there with the best of the best, but it really isn't bad if acid is an issue, as it is for me."
"This rice milk surpassed my expectations.  It tastes so good and it's real creamy!  The powder does not dissolve well in cold water so I mix large batches in hot water (a drinkable temperature, not boiling) once a week then store in the fridge to drink later.  I do not even need to shake it prior to use because the powder dissolves so well when mixed in hot water."
I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
"Low calorie, its true. Try other flavors not Salt & Vinegar.  Wish I could return them, but we ate 2.  Or at least tried to, yuck!"
"I put some in my morning joe, and I wasn't able to drink it.  The flavor was terrible.  I haven't baked with it yet so I dont't know if will taste better in baked goods or not."
"The slots wernt exactly evenly spaced and its a bit stiff to pull out/push in. But bottom line it works! And looks good! For the price, can't beat it."
I ordered this rice on a whim. I am so happy I did. It has a wonderful aroma when it is cooking. It fluffs up nice and has a great flavor and texture. The package size is quite handy. All in all I am totally happy with my purchase and will reorder.
"Tried the first one and wish I didn't have the rest of the 36 bars to eat through. Grainy paste texture and a very bitter aftertaste. It was my first time to try halvah. Sorry, but I recommend that maybe Amazon think about food samplers for people to try new products without the large outlay of money."
"It may seem like a very decadent extravagance to spend so much for such a small amount of vinegar, and I suppose it is, but it's really worth it if you have acquired a taste for great balsamic. We use it regularly on salads, etc, and it still lasts about 4 months."
These are great!  They are sour but not too sour and have a really great taste to them.  Brought them to work and shared with coworkers.  They keep asking when I'm going to bring more!  The double pack is worth the price!
I enjoy a variety of Yogi teas and I'm really enjoying the flavor of this tea.  I normally squeeze a lemon in to my green teas so that I can enjoy the taste without sugar or honey but this tea due to the hint of blueberry does not need any help.  I will stock up on this.  Can't say anything about the slimming part as I've just started drinking this today.  Very happy with purchase.
This is my second purchase. Sent them to my boyfriend who just loved them - couldn't stop eating them. Glad they are back in stock.
"We were just in Scotland, the flavor and freshness of this product was the same.  Its good that we don't have to pay for a plane ticket to get goodness!"
"Culture fires right up and makes good bread. Instructions clear and precise. Be sure to check out breadtopia's website for nice, slow-paced videos that are Very helpful."
"I grew up on Cocoa Wheats! As a child growing up in Ohio, it was the perfect hot cereal for cold winter mornings. My sister and I ate it every day with a little bit of sugar and milk. We moved to Florida when I was a teenager and for years couldn't find it. Recently Publix started carrying it and will gladly order it for us if they run out. Great stuff!!!"
These Soy & Wasabi almonds from Blue Diamond are my absolute favorite - just enough kick & the almonds tide you over until mealtime. The resealable bag keeps them nice & fresh.  Love them!!
"I enjoy that this product gave you a number of various flavors to try at once. I also liked that it wasn't one of each flavor (especially since there was two boxes) so that you could try them a couple of times to be sure that you enjoyed what you were getting or not.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of people stated that there was a plastic taste to their beverages after having these. I have not noticed a plastic taste in the ones that I have tried so far. I'm wondering if older ones that have been stored for longer may get this plastic taste?<br /><br />Someone else said that the Timothy's products had poor seals and would leak coffee grounds all over in the pot and into the drinking vessel when they were being used. I'm not sure if this is linked to a certain Keurig coffee pot or not but mine, the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee pot does not do this. I have also not noticed poor sealing in this cups either.<br /><br />I have also enjoyed the flavors that I have tried so far and I can't wait to try more of them."
We have had this ring for about a year now and our 3 year old German Shepherd still has not broken through! She pulls in out of her toy box about once a week to give it a good chew. The design is great since it allows her to hold down the bone and still chew. Definitely worth the money!
"We tried a variety of decaf cup brands and found Timothy's Columbian to be the best.  We like the bold taste, but it's not too strong, we use the 6 oz of water.  If you like it even less strong you can use the 8 oz of water. We just like the taste. It comes in the 50 Count K-Cups, which makes it really easy for price, storage and shipping.  I schedule my order for every 6 weeks and they arrive automatically, without my having to go in and order every time we're low on k-cups, and the shipping is free.  I can also go into Amazon and check the status to see when my order will be shipped and change the order date if I want it earlier or later.  Excellent coffee, excellent service. We're very happy."
"Errrr, I hate to tell you folks this, but this is made from the whole leaf, LOL. Check out the Sweetleaf website. This one is made more for topical applications. It won't hurt to drink it because it doesn't have anything harmful in it but it's more for skin irritations and such, that may be why you guys didn't like it in beverages.<br /><br />This dark concentrate is renowned for its ability to soften skin and help to smooth out wrinkles. Just apply, and after 30 to 60 minutes wash it away. It's worth trying on any skin problem. You'll be amazed!<br /><br /> Unrefined whole leaf concentrate made with water<br />- Helps pancreas<br />- May help regulate blood sugar levels<br />- Can be used as a topical agent for blemishes<br /><br />It's still sweet and you could use it that way, but since it's made from the whole leaf all those great plant phenols and stuff are flavoring the coffee;)<br /><br />It's a very easy mistake to make with Stevia.<br /><br />Having said that, I'll say this. Sweetleaf is the only company I've run across so far that doesn't add fillers and other sugars to their Stevia. I love Sweetleaf Stevia.<br /><br />Maltodextrin is a processed hydrolyzed starch used as a filler by a lot of companies. My question is why?<br /><br />There are a couple of other sugars they like to add too. Stevia is great all by itself. It seems as though they're determined to muck up a very healthy thing, sigh."
"For all you health conscious people who still need your chocolate fix, I'm sure this is a great cereal for you and your kids.  I guess we are just too used to thinking chocolate is supposed to taste like cocoa pebbles or chocolate frosted flakes.  (Yes, super chocolatey and super sugary).  I know I'm not the only one who loves that.  This was too bland for us, but still o.k.  I wouldn't buy it again, but will finish off the 4 boxes and go back to our tried and true :)  S&S was a great deal for this though."
"Best Energy bar ever...healthy, tasty, & less than 4 ingredients.  What could be better than that.  Great taste too."
I bought a bunch of the powder from the company for soups. I am very happy. It seems high quality.
"I had my dog on this food until he developed an infection in his anal glands. My vet told me not to use this food anymore because it is made in china and the glucosamine in the Happy Hips formula provides no benefit to my dog because the amount of glucosamine is too small and its not a high quality. He had us switch to Royal Canin<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K2OK"">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Giant Breed Adult 28 Formula, 35-Pound Bag</a> - so far our dog is doing really well with this food, firmer stool, loves to eat it, etc. And for the glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM we are using Dasaquin<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MCVGEA"">Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 Tablets</a> which is a pharmaceutical grade supplement, same manufactorer makes a supplement for human consumption as well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor- buy a solid supplement and a dog food that is not produced in China."
Basket was sent as a gift and arrived as promised. Recipient was extremely impressed<br />with selection of items in basket.
These little treats are his favorite treat and he loves all three flavors but especially the peanut butter flavor.  They are great for training or just because.
I'm not even a big fan of dark chocolate but these nuts are delicious! They are the perfect thing to snack on to help rid sweet cravings and they contain the same amount of fat/calories than the plain almonds. They don't even have added sugar!
"There are several brands of Miso-cup Soup on the market and in the grocery stores, all with the same or similar names.<br /><br />I have tried several of them and have been disappointed to the point where I have to throw the remaining product in the trash.<br /><br />This Miso-cup soup, distributed by Edward & Sons Trading in Carpinteria, CA uses higher quality ingredients than the others, and tastes a lot better.<br /><br />It can be used as a broth to cook rice too."
"I really enjoy the flavor of this coffee! The taste is subtle and not too strong.  The only problem is that in almost every package there is at least one pod that is ripped or broken and all the coffee is in the bottom of the bag...very messy and of course, the pod is unusable.<br />A little quality control would go a long way!"
"Excellent GF bread mix.  I use it to make dinner rolls with grated cheese mixed in, and melted garlic butter brushed on top.  Very easy and tasty.  Even the rest of my family who can eat gluten like these rolls.  Also makes good sandwich buns.  I always keep it on hand.  You do have to mix the dough by hand, and it is very sticky, so I use more oil than the directions call for, and put oil on my hands before I start mixing it."
I purchased these for my husband as he was recently diagnosed as diabetic.  I eat them as much as he does!  There is no strange after-taste as with some sugar-substitute enhanced foods.  We highly recommend.
"Nothing wrong with the product - I have bought this many times before.  However... it wasn't really clear that the Liquid Nation description of a Double Pack really means 1 bulk bag per the photo.  So for over $50 including shipping you get 32 cups of coffee.  Now that's expensive whichever way you look at it.<br />Shop around and you will find bulk packs of 80 cups for only $2-3 more including shipping.  Shame on me for getting ripped off, I won't be using Liquid Nation ever again."
"Pho is one of my all-time favorite foods. When I saw this at the grocery store, I was extremely excited. I'd been waiting for a product like this for a long time. I bought both the chicken and veggie varieties.<br /><br />Both flavors were terrible.  Neither tastes anything like any bowl of Pho I've ever tasted. It's horrific. Both flavors have a terrible citrusy/sweet taste that just doesn't come close to Pho -- or taste good in any way.<br /><br />I give this product a (very generous) two stars because the idea is awesome, and the organic/MSG-free recipe caught my eye.  Unfortunately, the execution is terrible. I can't believe the people that made this product let it go to market tasting like it does. I won't be buying this ever again unless they completely reformulate their recipe."
new zico chocolate is awesome....it's delicious and i love that its so much less sugar. i grew up on yoo-hoo but those days are over! zico chocolate is great for post workout and gets me going in the morning. love it!
"I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra ""oomph"" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese."
"Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are almonds roasted with cocoa rather than covered with chocolate, which makes them healthier and less fattening than traditional chocolate-covered almonds. This is is an advantage if you don't want to have to wear clothing made in Indonesia, a highly laudable goal considering that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist. What's more, they taste excellent, too. In fact, these are chocolate-flavored nuts for people who care about watching their weight."
"I recently ordered two of these lovely little plants, the Sparkle Star and the classic pink-flowering desert rose.  Both arrived well-packed and right on time, and are healthy with new growth sprouting at the top.<br /><br />The larger plant, the Sparkle Star, came without soil (as per the description) and many of the bottom leaves have fallen off due to transport stress.  However, as I said before there is a good deal of new growth, and they are hardy little plants in general.  If you're looking for a nice plant to keep indoors (in a well-lighted area), I'd definitely recommend these plants and this seller.<br /><br />Just a note: desert roses are poisonous, so wash your hands well after touching the plants, and keep out of the way of pets and young children."
"Skippy Peanut Butter, Creamy, 16.3-Ounce Jars recall<br /><br />I got a recall notice about this from Amazon. But the notice said the low fat variety which this is not!<br /><br />Will have to update this review I've tried the product if it's not part of the recall."
"I'm a great 'jet fuel' coffee person. So I figured I'd give ""Jet Fuel"" a try in my Keurig. My favorites are still Emeril's Big Bold and Timothy's Rain Forest Espresso. Unfortunately ""Jet Fuel"" is not as bold and full bodied and leaves a thin aftertaste that is not pleasant to my taste. Definitely will not be on my re-order list."
I take a medication for my Rheumatoid arthritis which leaves a nasty aftertaste in my mouth. I also have dry mouth from Sj&ouml;grens's. I have been using Life Savers for a while now to help with these problems. I seem to go through a roll in fairly short time. I like the rolls because they seem to cause less trash. However these bags were too good a bargain to pass up. I had been out when the package arrived so I opened the bag right away. The mints were nice and fresh. They tasted great. Later I am going to try to see if they really will spark when I chew them. But even if they don't I am really pleased with this order. Thanks. I will order more in a few months when these are gone.
"This is one of the best products in the array of ""greens"" out on the market.  The taste is most definitely one of the best.  Green Superfood is a great addition to a balanced alkaline/acid diet.  When my body is overly acidic (which is obvious when my stomach or body is sluggish or feeling like I'm coming down with something), I make a shake and it helps to balance it out.  I used to add a few items to the mix to make it even more powerful, i.e. fresh kale, banana, aloe, and flax oil.  Nowadays I simply use a frozen half banana, flax oil, and a touch of carob powder.  Mix it up with a bit of ice and you have a great shake, especially good during the summer months.  And for some crazy ideas, especially during the really hot months, add a bit of Baileys or Kahlua to the mix.  Yum, yum!  It's like having your vegetables with your junk food.  Or maybe try adding some Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream and present it to the kids (sans the liquor, of course).  There is a kids version of this product, also.  Both an adult version and the kids version come in chocolate, but I like making that decision for myself, so I buy the plain.  This is a great way to get your vits/minerals in a powdered, raw food product.  It's gluten free, vegan, and no soy fillers.  Also, 70% organic.  You would have to eat a truck load of raw foods to get the same level of nutrients that you receive in one scoop of Amazing Grass Green SuperFood.  And no, I do not work for the company."
"bought these as a gift for my mother who like's these and she loved them, i tried even though not a fan of hot stuff and thought they were fine, these are not easy to find in stores so ordering them is easy and the price is not bad"
"I first tried sprouting with a jar with a drain lid. It was hard to drain the water all the way out, it was a pain to rinse the seeds, and my sprouts would rot, before they even sprouted. Air couldn't get to them, and I live in Nebraska, a very arid region.<br /><br />Then I got this thing. If you can't grow sprouts in this, just rinse them more. It drains effortlessly. The instructions are ridiculously easy to follow. You can grow tons of sprouts really fast. I grew, tall, strong, deep green, and super potent sprouts in a matter of days. They will not go bad if you keep them in here and keep rinsing them, I rinse about 3 times a day, but you could probably get away with once depending on where you live. You will basically have a living, growing food, that you can eat at your leisure.<br /><br />The smallest seed I have put in them so far is radish, but I'm sure smaller seeds could work, and you could always put a growing sponge on the bottom.<br /><br />During the winter I will get a second one because it will be one of the only ways to get fresh greens in my area, and I'm a vegetarian, so that is super important to me.<br /><br />These are made in the US."
The AriZona Sugar Free Pomegrante Green Tea is one of the best tasting Green Teas I have found so far and it's sugar free which is very important for me because I have Type 2 Diabetes and need to drink as much water (or sugar free drinks) as I can per day.
"It's true, our miniature dachshunds absolutely love these.  They are a special treat for them.  Unfortunately, they go through them fairly quickly, but it's their absolute favorite!"
"I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn. Some complain it doesn't all pop, that's because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop. It always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up. I love it."
"As usual with Newman's Own Products, I found his Special Blend Decaf K-cup coffee to be great. Strong enough for me, without being very acidic.  I continue to be a K cup lover, despite my feelings of overpaying for ""home-brewed"" coffee.  The K cups are just so darn convenient and easy to make.  I keep my K cup cooker right on my bedroom lavatory shelf.  Turn it on when I get up and the coffee is ready to brew before I have finished with my morning tasks.  And the Special Blend is oh so good."
"I have 3 dogs with different needs and tastes and this is one of the few foods that meets them and basically one of the only ones I can afford.<br />My oldest (14) loves the lamb, my husky loves the glucosamine and the youngest farts less on this food which makes everyone happy.<br />I always try to find food with good ingredients and this meets that standard while staying one of the cheapest foods. I thoroughly recommend it!"
I love this stuff. I never could never use artifical sweetners they all taste terrible to me. Erythritol tastes like sugar to me. It has helped me lose 30 pounds. I wish it was cheaper.
"This is an INCREDIBLY GREAT AND HEALTHY PRODUCT, however. . .<br />THE PRICE IS 5x THE PRICE ELSEWHERE - See for yourself - you can get this for $1.75 per box from many other online sources.<br />Amazon - please help!! Sell it direct from Amazon for a competitive price!!"
"If you are buying hemp oil, consider it for the health benefits and not the taste. Nutiva's Hemp Oil is descried as having a ""nutty"" taste. It does not taste nutty, but rather ""earthy.""<br /><br />Its about a 5/10 taste wise; not terrible, not great. I've tried using it as a replacement for olive oil, but the taste of the oil comes through too strongly.<br /><br />This product may be a good use to throw in for shakes or smoothies for its health benefits, but I do not consider this a viable replacement for traditional oils.<br /><br />EDIT: I've found mixing in hemp oil in shakes or making salad dressings is quite tasty."
"Already knew I loved this coffee - half-caff is the way to go for me and my college daughter, too.<br />It was great to get a large quantity delivered to our home at a very good price."
"love the oil. but i hate the jar, whenever i try to pour out some of the oil it spills every where. for this reason going 2 try another brand next time."
"Haven't used vanilla beans before so wasn't sure what to expect -- but thought they seem fairly dry, thought they would be moister."
"this is my first time ordering from Amazon, and my package arrived on time and in tact. Will defintely order again and will also check out other products sold here now that I know they have great service for online shopping...this was a great first experience with Amazon.com =o)"
just look whats in it! not good  its like burger king for dogs! total garbage...
This dressing is the best you will ever find.  I not only use it on traditional salads but on cut up mixed veggies like cucumbers and tomato with onion.  Simply delicious and worth the money.
"About a year ago I decided to put my dog on a better food as she was (at the time) 11 yeas old and I want her to live the longest, healthiest life possible, much like everyone else, as she is not just a pet to me but also a daughter. I stopped at my local ""mom & pop"" pet food store and asked some questions. I knew little about the better brands as she's always been on grocery store brands. I was directed toward Orijen as it is one of the better brands out there, it's very high in protein, you can understand all of the ingredients and it's ""so healthy, a human could eat it"". Of course I bought it, and my dog loved it. Little did I know how damaging the food was to her, as quite honestly, she exhibited no symptoms. Back in January my dog had to be put in the ICU due to an accident. It was during that stay where the vet noticed how high her liver levels were. Her alkaline & phosphatase as well as her calcium levels in the kidneys were all very high as well. The vet put her on 3 different liver support medicines and we had to follow up every month with more blood work to reassess the situation. After the 3rd month, the vet was suspicious that cancer was present. When I hear that, I immediately did some research on the food. It was then that I noticed how high the protein content is and what that much protein could do to a body. I presented my research and concerns to the vet, who wasn't as convinced as I was. After the 4th blood draw, and still no changes, we made the mutual decision to wean her off of Orijen and on to Science Diet (although just about any other brand would have worked too). A month later after the switch, and my dog was presented with a clean bill of health. Her alkaline & phosphatase levels are still slightly elevated, but I'm told there is nothing to worry about now. We concluded it was the food that was damaging and slowly killing her, as she was deemed healthy at the start of feeding her the food, A few months prior to all of this, she went though a full work up in order to get her teeth cleaned.<br /><br />I write this not to slander Orijen, I only want to educate others on my own personal experience. While it happened to my dog, that doesn't mean it will effect all dogs the same. Just please keep in mind, my dog showed no symptoms while on the food that anything was wrong. If it weren't for her stay in the hospital, we never would have known how much damage this food was causing her. If your dog is presently on this food, maybe a precautionary blood draw at their next exam would be worth your while."
"Tried these one day when I was starving at work and needed a snack, a coworker gave me one. I was impressed with how yummy and natural they are. I immediately wanted more, so I found them on here and now get a box delivered monthly. I use them as a healthy snack at work, at home, or when I'm out cycling. At the auto-deliver price, they work out to around $.80 per bar or so, which I think is very reasonable. I'm happy to have a ""good fat"" snack in the house for us to eat, instead of resorting to chips, candy bars, etc. I did counsel my family that they can only have one per day, as while they're good fat, they should still be eaten in moderation. :) Anyways - they're delicious! Buy them!"
I grew up eating these cookies.  Got a case for a great price.  Will be looking for them again this fall.
This has an unique taste to it. Has a hint of charcoal flavoring.  We use it on thin cut beef to eat with rice. Being black it does turn what you are cooking black also. But taste great!
"Campbells Creamy Tomato Parmesan soup at hand is very tasty and convenient! I notice when I have a stuffy head, or especially a sore throat, that it is really soothing. I swear it made my throat better, and I really FELT better after I sipped it down. The only thing I do not like is how SWEET this soup is, which I wasn't expecting. But, still, its good. However, the classic tomato flavor is NOT so sweet and it has HALF the calories of this one! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MIFS5M"">Campbell's Soup at Hand, Classic Tomato, 10.75-Ounce Microwavable Cups (Pack of 8)</a>.<br />Creamy Tomato Parmesan:<br />Calories  -  220 (per unit)<br />Protein  - 5 grams<br />Fat  -  7 grams<br />Carbs - 35 grams<br />Sugars -  20 grams<br />and only 27% of calories from fat!"
I have a professional expresso machine and have had it for nearly 10 years. I decided to try these beans because the hype was convincing.  The express / lattes that were made using these beans was really awful. It tasted like gas station out of a vending machine coffee.  It was so bad that I had to brew all the beans to remove from my machine and it did this so that i could put in Starbucks beans. So much for experimenting.
"Just received my shipment. Tasty chips, but as my title says, they have 120mg of sodium which is almost double the amount listed by amazon on the product page."
I recently purchased this for a good friend's 60th Birthday and everyone enjoyed going through the collection and calling our their favorite candies from their childhood.  Absolutely recommend!!
"My friend had a pack at her house that she purchased from a fundraiser.  I noticed the little box sitting on the table and inquired, as I like licorice.  Well I pop one of these minis into my mouth and thought hard perhaps stale?  Strong menthol, kind of gross tasting, and lastly that I love them anyways and need a lifetime supply, so thank G-D for the internet.  Everyone I know ends up liking them, though they are not sure why?  :-)"
"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS COFFEE. IF YOU ARE A REAL COFFEE DRINKER, LIKE MYSELF, THAN GO FOR IT."
"I use the Clear Scalp therapy in combination with the Clear Scalp shampoo and it has fixed my dry scalp and dandruff problem. I use the Scalp therapy on my hair right before I dry it. It not only has helped my dry scalp, but it also adds volume to my hair. The Clear Scalp is a wonderful set of products"
"I have a 2 yr old and a 4yr old and this cereal is perfect for their small hands and mouths and it's all natural too!  It's really hard to find an all natural cereal without all the added junk.  This cereal only has 3 ingredients (organic whole grain wheat, natural cane sugar, and vitamin E).  The kids love it as a snack or for a healthy breakfast.  It may not be as sweet as it's competitors, but what's wrong with that?  Who needs all that sugar?!"
What a waste of money. Flowers? were wilted and had a chemical smell that stung my eyes. Don't Rush these to any women you respect.
"I love this stuff!  add a little bit of cornstarch(to get the sticky texture) and some seasoned rice vinegar and microwave it for a few seconds and it makes a wonderful low carb, low cal substitute for sushi rice!  I also love it in soups in place of noodles and in place of steamed rice in any curry dish.  the texture is not quite rice, but in sushi rolls you wouldn't notice unless you're looking for it.  in a soup, they feel more like little pasta balls, but are still really good and filling.  I will definitely be ordering more of this, and will recommend it to any of my low carb friends craving sushi :)"
OMG this stuff is so good. i know its is weird but i hate chocolate and love white chocolate and this is the best yet.
"Good, but not a replacement for what I usually drink. I'm into soda mainly for the caffeine, so I was disappointed to find that this beverage is caffeine free. I love that it's organic, though, and the taste is still great... but if you're after a caffeine buzz, this is not the soda for you."
"A great  dark roast coffee, my husband and I tried many different dark roast coffees and found that we always came back to  Green Mountain Dark Magic.  It has a full bodied rich flavor."
"If you want to serve a tasty rice, this is the one.  It is healthy wholesome rice compared to a mix style box that adds lots of sodium.<br /><br />Recommend to anyone to create a restaurant style quality to your meal.<br /><br />It take 45 minutes to cook, so I start it first thing on the stove and prepare the rest of the entrees of the meal.<br /><br />Amazon also offer this rice at a very good price compare to my local grocery store.  Thank you for an affordable price."
However.....<br />You can get a better price at Target or Walmart....$4.14 for a box of four = Approximately $1.04 a bar.  One drawback to Target and Walmart though is they are frequently out of stock due to being so popular.
I have tried this from Influenster and its delish! I also purchased more of this because it became my son's favorite snack! Love it too! :)
It took me a while to find out that Amazon.com sold spices as well as other items. The pure Himalayan salt is difficult to find; and sometimes more expensive than you expect.  Amazon.com had it at a very reasonable price.  I will be purchasing my spices from here when I can't find items in local stores.
What else can I say about this many fine quality boxes of lifesavers for the price? Except I have to write more words for this review to qualify ...
"I don't understand why other reviewers are complaining about the sugar content in this product. GO TO THE WEBSITE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. This product has 1 gram of sugar per serving! I don't understand how people think this stuff is ""too sweet"". All I know is it sticks to the roof of your mouth like no other peanut butter!"
This is my favorite flavor for my Keurig - smooth and delicious!!  You can really taste the chocolate and the raspberry flavors and they compliment each other nicely. We use Sweet  Cream in it and it is sooooo delightful!
"I purchased this item in preparation for our first cruise.  Neither of us know whether or not we'll experience motion sickness on the ship.  I plan to take a bunch of these along as well as the ginger crystals packets.<br /><br />I honestly didn't expect these chews to be as good as they are.  They're very chewy and sweet without being too sweet.<br />The ginger sort of creeps up on you as you chew them.<br /><br />Very tasty, individually wrapped candies.  I plan to put out dishes of them in our home for us and guests."
"The flavor itself is good, I like this coffee and will enjoy it. Nothing more convenient for a college student than the keurig, although its somewhat more costly... I am willing to pay the costs and find them acceptable. Others may not, but keurig is a matter of opinion I suppose. The coffee is well brewed by my mr. Coffee keurig, but the flavor isn't what I expected. Bare cup, taste only vanilla, which I found a bit dissapointing because I love caramel; the caramel flavor only comes out when I add sugar (three packets of sugar in the raw, in my experience). Sugar added it tastes great, but the caramel is minute as compared to the vanilla...<br /><br />All in all it's good. I will try Gloria jeans butter toffee next, and choose a favorite after that (big into sugary flavored coffee). Otherwise, get this if just to try it. You won't regret it."
"My toddler loves these little things, has since he was 10 months old. Although he can eat an entire can in one day now that he's 3...doctor told me that as a snack/filler this is not a bad thing to feed kids at young ages, has some good ingredients and isn't fried or full of fat.  Do try to eat the contents within a week, so they stay fresh and crisp."
"Love the new Crunchy Nut cereal.  Tastes like honey drizzeled over corn flakes and nuts.  Not much more to say.  If you like those 3 things, you will love this!"
I write to recommend Wholey foods and their calamari product. It is especially good for those who cannot cook. Product is fresh and good. One must follow instructions.  The seller is very accomodating and friendly and will do anything to see you are happy with the sale. Amazon should  keep this seller on a high level and recommend the product to all. Joe Parzymies
Good quantity for the price and feels good on  skin Smell is acceptable  ONly problem is its almost solid in jar and have to dig it out but after warming it in hands it goes on pretty well. At least it doesnt  feel like 1/2 water like most moiturizers. Id buy it again.
"For the most part these are pretty good, but not as good as the real thing. Have the same texture and feel as the sugar version. Some of the flavors are excellent and some are definitely not. Might just be a matter of personal taste. With so many sugar free products to choose from, will probably not buy these again."
A great item for your survival reserve stash or just when you run outta milk and are too far from the store!  The cream makes it delicious!
"I completely agree that this item is pricey but frankly, it purees better than my blender, food mill or cuisinart can.  I tried each of the other appliances and while they certainly ground up the food, the consistency was a bit lumpy with each.  The babycook actually created a creamy paste out of the food and my little one has LOVED the food I've made.  It's certainly not the only item out there for making baby food but if you have the money and the inclination to make your own baby food, then you really can't go wrong with this product."
"Frontier chicory is the best chicory I've found so far. From the bright and deep aroma to the noticeable smooth taste it's a pleasure to drink and enjoy.<br /><br />Frontier chicory is not a fine ground chicory. At first I thought this might be a fault, but I was wrong.  It's perfect.<br /><br />I have also tried other chicories, including Community Kitchen brand. Community Kitchen chicory is fine ground, but weak in aroma and flavor compared to Frontier.<br /><br />Other Frontier products have been outstanding and their chicory is exceptional."
I love Paul Newman - so no offense to the man - but I have a male cat and I truly believe this food caused him to get crystals.  Won't buy it again.  Perhaps it would be good for female cats.  Nuff Said.
"Excellent taste, smooth, easy going.  I like a mild drink to start my day and this is it.  Heartily endorse this coffee."
"I like the Tortuga original better than this cake. First of all the rum is cooked with butter and other ingredients, depending on how you like to make it, and made into a glaze. There are some people that think the rum is soaked in straight from the bottle and I am going to assume that these people don't drink. In this brand the rum is not as intense. I am not sure what brand or type of rum they use but it is weak. The cake is crumbly, it was falling apart as I tried to slice it. If you serve this with ice cream or create some kind of dessert dish then I am sure your guests wouldn't mind. On the other hand it is a good price."
"Too bad, I was looking forward to these, but they were awful.  Unusable.  Smelled EXACTLY like my anatomy class dissection room, unmistakable odor.  My guess is that chemicals were added to them to preserve them.  Anyway, what a disappointment: returned.  Thanks for making that easy at least, Amazon."
"I have been enjoying this unique tea for the past couple of years and give it 5 stars.  In the latest batch I received (June 2012), the tea just tastes plain, as if they accidently switched it for unflavored green tea or mislabeled the bottles.  I wonder if anyone else has experienced this.  Hopefully, it is a one-time issue and the next batch will have the unique rose flavor."
"This is excellent salsa.  I recommend it if you like smooth, piquant flavour with a hint of heat; with soft, distinct chunks of ingredients."
I liked this product.  It's a little bland so I add a pinch of pepper and it's fine for me.
"I sent this item as a gift to Chimphaven.  It was on their ""wish list"".  Have never heard from them so am not sure it was ever received.  Probably would not order online again from you all."
I've tried several flavors. The macadamia and apricot is the best with the apple cinnamon a close second<br />Very tasty
Our dog loves this stuff.  Ground up and sprinkled on his dry food he just gobbles it up.  No additives or fillers no carbs. We also use as a treat.  Best price at Amazon and quick delivery.
"This is very spicy hot.  Almost too hot for us, but we can eat it fine.<br /><br />It's very flavorful and the smell as it's cooking is just wonderful.<br /><br />As another reviewer wrote, I too strain out the spices before I add the water to the vegetables because I don't like to bite down on them while eating.<br /><br />This pairs very nicely with the Butter Chicken Curry (also by Kitchens Of India)."
"Generally the dog biscuits are great if not such a high percentage would be broken. The point in buying extra large biscuits is the ""extra large"", small pieces miss the reason for buying theme in the first place. There has to be a better way to pack the biscuits better than this."
"Love mberry, and while I have tried these before and they were fabulous, I did not receive my order this time! Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I don't know where the fault lies, but if this has happened before, it is likely the seller."
"I find this kcup to have a bad aftertaste. It is fairly strong, and I do primarily drink strong coffees. I much prefer the Tullys French Roast.  If you can pick this up on sale they are worth a ""shot""."
"This is really tasty stuff, and I sure wish it were organic as stated in the product description above, but let's not confuse ""natural"" with organic. Organic means grown without chemical pesticides and grown without using genetically modified seeds. There is no guarantee that this is the case with ""natural"" products such as this and likely they could be GMO and sprayed with pesticides. If it were truly an organic product I would have given it 5 stars, and it certainly is priced like an organic product. Still, quality of ingredients aside, it is very yummy. But so is junk food."
Good price for 108 ct. coffee. You know how fast you can go through K cups. The coffee has a nice taste to it.
"These are fabulous!  Tastes great, no real 'gluten free' taste as some things have.  My kids loved them also.  They are on the smaller side, and it might help with portion control, but we couldn't stop eating them. =)<br /><br />I would definitly purchase again!  I also love their pizza crust mix."
"illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cafe, is exactly what it promises to be:  strong, black, sweet Italian espresso.<br /><br />At 45 calories a can, it's sweeter than I would personally choose, but not too sweet to enjoy.<br />I drink mine cold and straight from the can in an attempt to wake up and greet the day.<br /><br />The can warns, 'do not shake,' and that's not because it's carbonated or fizzy; it's a full can and shaking causes enough expansion for the drink to spew (think Mt. Etna).<br /><br />Coffee preference is a very personal issue; we each have our favorite brands and brews.  For me Illy is at the top of the list.  So, if you like Peet's Italian Roast or Starbucks Cafe Verona, this may be a brew for you.<br /><br />Drink it cold from the can and pry those eyes open!"
Excellent stuff that helps you maintain a well balanced lifestyle. I drink it 3 times a day and it has helped me feel much healthier.  Bragg's is only Apple Cider Vinegar and the best!
"I have been using Lavazza Super Crema for lattes I make every morning with my Gaggia Classic for over a year now. In my humble opinion, this is the smoothest and best tasting espresso I have come across. There is no bitterness or bad after taste, just smooth and creamy and I make really good crema with it as well. Top notch coffee!!"
"A great candy with a nice center! No complaints at all about these. I wish I would have gone down a size though, they are not HUGE but... I actually shared some with friends because you get a load of these."
"Finally, a nutritious snack that actually tastes good! I normally don't like apricots but this bar is not overpowered by the fruit.  It's the right combination of almond and apricot flavors so that it's not overly sweet or nutty.  I do wish it were a bit bigger in portion.  It doesn't feel like a meal replacement but definitely a good snack. Even if you're not a big apricot fan, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  The monthly delivery service also provides a nice little discount!"
"I love these soy crisps.  They are the perfect salty crunch.  I have a hard time finding snack foods that don't have wheat, corn, or some sort of sugar sweetener in them.  But these fit the bill.  They are *very* salty, tho. I like them that way, but if you're not used to it and can be kindof surprising."
My 93 yr old Aunt loves peanut brittle and I can't find it in the stores. I sent her some of this for her birthday through Amazon and she loved it.
"I decided to purchase this balsamic after reading a few good reviews.<br /><br />From what I heard from a few people, I expected much more.  This is a watery vinegar and does not cling to your food like the better balsamics. I put a couple drops on some cheese and they instantly rolled off onto the plate. It's also much more sour than I expected.  The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly.  I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet.<br /><br />It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste.  I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food.  I imagine it would make a good reduction.  It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.  If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you.  I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment.<br /><br />The Amazon price is also on the high side.  You can currently get two bottles of this exact product on eBay for $12."
"I've tried two of the major coconut oil brands that I order via the internet. I've been using the oil in food and on my skin for about 5 years. I ordered this just to see how it tasted because the price was so good, if it didn't taste right, I'd just use it on my skin. It is the BEST tasting oil I've tried. Tropical Traditions, Coconut Oil Supreme pale in comparison. This is truly a coconut oil you could eat right out of the jar. If you want to try a coconut oil that tastes as good as it smells, this is it. And the price is fabulous. Yea, Nutiva and Amazon!"
"My nephew seems to enjoy these purees.  My only comments are:<br /><br />- it is a bit watery.  If it was slightly thicker, it would make feeding much easier as it would be much easier to get it into his mouth.  To make it thicker, I blend the puree with a little banana or steamed yams to give it a thicker consistency and make it easier to eat.<br /><br />- Another note is that each pouch is so large.  The instructions indicate to use within 24 hours of opening.  In my nephew's case, he's 6 months old.  There is no way he will be able to finish a single 4.5oz pouch in 24 hrs in addition to drinking his milk.  I have had no problems with using the packs over 2-3 days."
"This is probably one of the best mix and match of vegetarian goodies that I've seen in a while. I don't eat red meat and my meals are generally consisted of vegetables and soups. That's why when I came across the advertisement of this product, I immediately decided to give it a try. And I must say, these canned goodies are really tasty and nutritious. In fact, I am already thinking of ordering them again."
"Nice mix ,what really suprised me is the fact that it was ordered on wednesday night and we got it on friday afternoon."
"Good flavor. Will be ordering this often for ""mexican"" type recipes. This are a nice ""enchilada"" size, but do they offer ""burrito"" size? I didn't see it."
Excellent smooth taste. Any one who loves chocolate will enjoy this drink. Almost has good as International house's dark mayan chocolate coffee was.
My husband is GF and a vegan-- we make these using egg replacer and do the option with oil instead of margarine.  They are really really good!  Very moist!  Easy to bake and never last long in this house!  Yummy!
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7VYRA"">Snyder's of Hanover Cheddar Cheese Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> package claims these pretzels are bursting with flavor. I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2"" x 3/4"" - 1""  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot.

"Lewis Labs Brewer's Yeast Buds 14 OzI use this product in my dog's food every evening.  I found information (somewhere?) that brewer's yeast help repel fleas.  I have been using this for 6-7 years and my dogs have not had one flea in all of that time.  I have heard that it is a good supplement for human use as well.  I should give it a  try myself, I guess."
"When Gracie wants to go out, I don't know if it's to relieve herself or to, again, get some treats.  I haven't tried one, but she says more, more.  I assume they are five star.  They are individually large treats so I cut them up.  I think she prefers more, more than large."
"-- Update --<br />Sadly, though, two of the stalks did not recover, so I had to remove them. I am still hoping though, so I transferred them to a different container and cut out all the dead parts. We'll see how it works.<br /><br />The one stalk did recover, but most of its leaves are limp and dying so I had to remove them. So right now, it's more of a stick with a little stump of a leaf bud, but I have not seen any signs of degradation to its health. I read that it takes longer for these plants to leaf up so I'm just going to watch closely. As of now, I can say it's recovering.<br />------------------<br /><br />Shipment came pretty quick. The plant was stuffed in a bunch of packing peanuts, with the roots soaked in plant gel (to keep the plant hydrated).<br /><br />I have to admit the plant looked a bit sad coming from the box, but considering it traveled from west to midwest, it's expected. It didn't look like it's dying, though, just a bit limp, the roots look healthy so I'm pretty sure it'd bounce back in a week or so.<br /><br />The vase it came with though was a bit too tiny for my taste. But I can just get a bigger one when my bamboo grows (pretty sure the bamboo will topple the vase over when it starts growing top heavy."
"When I am short on time to eat a proper meal, one of these bars and a beverage fits the bill.<br /><br />If I eat one of these and have a large coffee or a glass of iced tea, I won't be hungry for 3 hours.<br /><br />They taste great, have a nice texture and a good balance of protein, carbs and fats.<br /><br />I have tried all the flavors and the triple chocolate crunch is my favorite.<br /><br />They don't spike and crash my blood sugar like some bars do.<br /><br />If you have them in any kind of heat, like stashed in your purse or car, they will melt in the package.<br /><br />I keep these at home in our pantry to grab if the baby is upset and I haven't had a moment to eat anything.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is the cheapest you will find ANYwhere."
I was really looking forward to trying the pumpkin flavor - I was a little disappointed in the flavor and not as creamy as the other flavors I have tried.
Great refreshing drink. Replenishes electrolytes naturally after workout.  Quenches thrust much better than water and all naturally rather then all the junk in sports drinks.  Tastes good too.
"THIS PRODUCT (MIRACLE SHIRATAKI NOODLES) ARRIVED WITH SOME THE INDIVIDUAL PACKAGES FULL OF BROWN WATER, AND SOME WERE SWOLLEN WHICH COULD BE CAUSED BY BOTULISM AND SOME PACKS HAD NOTHING BUT WATER INSIDE....I THREW THE WHOLE ORDER AWAY..I COMPLAINED BUT HEARD NOTHING FROM AMAZON...I AM SORELY DISAPPOINTED AND OUT $30.00 SOMETHING DOLLARS...."
"I have just ended a 2+ year custody battle. Needless to say I have anxiety & I'm set off at the slightest thing. Then this little miracle fell into my lap. I was prepared for disappointment- didn't happen! The anxiety & edginess I had become all too familiar with has vanished. This affect is achieved with your very 1st dose. I now feel calm, literally. I no longer feel agitated. I no longer bite peoples head off. AND to top it all off I am sleeping soundly through the night EVERY night. No waking up, no tossing & turning, just solid, sound sleep. Thank you FIRST Magazine for this reccommendation!"
"This has become part of my regular vitamin routine.  The softgels are a little big, but I didn't have any problems swallowing them.  This really helps curb my appetite.  I love this stuff."
I tried one case about 2 months ago and absolutely love it.  I has a great kick and is excellent hot of cold.  I just received cases 3 and 4 (one for work and the other for home).  It has a very smooth hot chocolate taste when heated in the microwave.
"We are always pleased with Amazon's packaging. Chips are never crushed or broken, always fresh. We really liked this brand/flavor of chips. Very tasty!"
"Excellent value with supermarket prices on coffee escalating, Amazon.com's Subscribe and Save price with $0 shipping and handling is the best value out there!"
Arrived on time.  What a deal !!! So glad I could find this product on amazon !  I used this when i feel like im getting sick<br />Thanks !
"This stuff is great! I switched my 8 week old female GSD puppy to this about a week after I got her (the breeder gave me a bag of the food she was feeding her dogs...I think it was IAMS...) and immediately she had no more problems with diarrhea. In addition, I also sprinkle on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003153TEA"">Missing Link 8-Ounce Puppy Health Formula</a> and ""Schatzi"" loves it! I had no proof that these items worked well together until I visited the breeder when my puppy was ~4months old. The breeder still had one of my puppy's sisters (from the same litter), and there definitely was a noticeable difference between their coats. The ingredient's include copper proteinate and copper sulfate, which is probably why my puppy's coat was MUCH more glossy and her color's are more pronounced. The first bag lasted about a month, and I have already bought my second bag, which isn't bad for ~ $1.75/day -especially with the prime/free 2 day shipping option. She really likes this food and never leaves anything behind, and I will continue to buy!"
"I wasn't sure if my dogs would be able figure out what to do with this, but they got it right away.  They loved the taste and would have kept licking it as long as I let them. The container is 5"" tall and approx. 1 1/2"" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat."
"When I found out dogs could live healthily vegan, I jumped at the chance to share my diet with mine. This food was recommended by a friend so we tried it out and my beagle loved it. Granted, he's a beagle and will eat anything. But, I noticed huge improvements in his health after eating this food. He would often vomit after eating when he ate an omni diet and have digestive issues. He was never a dog that could eat meat straight up without getting sick, so perhaps he was sensitive to even the high end food with meat in it I had him on before this. He has rarely thrown up since having him on vegan food, if at all. It's been so long I can't remember. His weight has been easier to manage, and he has a nicer coat and even better smelling breath! All his vet visits have been great. I totally recommend vegan diets for doggies and specifically this brand of food. I usually buy a big bag of it, get the free shipping, and am good for a while."
"Sweet dried apricots.  No chemicals, sulfur, colors, other preservatives.  All natural.  Perfect for snacks between classes and on the trail.  I will definitely purchase again.  Highly recommended!"
"These taste ok but unfortunately for me they do not agree with my stomach, I plan to give away the rest of the carton."
I am totaly satisfied with my order of blue buffalo dry dog<br />food.  I am a senior pet owner and having this delivered to<br />my door is great for my pet and I.  Great delivery and<br />product.  I will be ordering again.<br />Thanks
"These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.  This ends up being a little over a handful for the entire package.<br /><br />Great to have on hand for those on the go times."
"A friend of mine knows that I like to watch what I eat as far as the chemicals and un-necessary processing so she turned me on to these bars.  First let me say, they are awesome. They have next to no processing, ZERO chemicals, and are very tastey.  Yes, they are hard.  What do you expect?? They're nuts!!! Nuts are hard!!!  The little pieces of the dried fruit they put in add a little sweetness but, they're still nuts and therefore crunchy. It's just like putting a handful of almonds in your mouth.<br /><br />In regards to the fat content, any health related magazine, doctor, and/or website will tell you that some of the ABSOLUTE best items to eat to help weight management and a live a healthy lifestyle are nuts and seeds.  They contain all of the good fat that you're body needs while hopefully, helping you stay away from the man-created/altered fats that destroy our cholestrol, hearts and general well-being. Just like coconut, high in fat, but one the best things you could possibly put into your body. Remember, everything in moderation.<br /><br />In regards to the size, yes they're small.  They are not a meal replacement bar but it is a decent amount of protein and good fats to satisfy you for a few hours until you can sit down and enjoy a healthy dinner.  While I try to eat 5 small meals a day, in my line of work, it's just not possible so I snack on one of these during the times I just can't have a decent meal and they get me through.  And have you checked out the price of nuts lately????  Any good raw nut costs upwards of $6.00lb, I've seen some as high as $18.00lb.  So, to have this bar prepared, shipped packaged and sold for about a $1.00 (just buy them in bulk, Costco is even cheaper) seems like a good deal to me.<br /><br />In regards to manufacturing, while I do wish they were put together closer to home, first and foremost, they are a business.  They have to watch their bottom line just like any of us.  If you do your research you will find that very few of the ingredients come from China (only some seeds and rice malt, I believe because they can't get them anywhere else).  Most of the ingredients come from the US then are shipped to China for manufacturing in a facility built specifically for Mrs. Mays.  Think about it.  If you can pay the same amount and have either 20 people or 1 person do a job, and those 20 people are being paid a good wage in their country, which makes more business sense.  Now, I don't like it, but I can understand it. Considering labor costs in this country, imagaine how much these bars would cost if manufactured here? And given the issues coming out of China recently, do you really think anyone manufacturing there would risk doing anything less than spectacular??? Not if they want to stay in business.<br />Check out their website for their safety and health inspection related info.<br /><br />What it boils down to is this, if you want a great little, portable, and extremely healthy snack and you're nuts about nuts, then you will love these bars.  Do we all wish they were made in the US, sure.  But barring that, they are a great product for any health conscious individual as well as vegetarians and vegans alike.  Like I said earlier, they're awesome!!"
"I ordered this sampler for my aunt for christmas.  I called her after they arrived and she was THRILLED!  She said they are delicious, and also commented on what a wonderful gift idea.  She lives alone, and in another state, so this was the perfect gift and size for her!  She can even invite a friend over to enjoy with her.  I just ordered a larger Rib Eye package for my husband and myself to enjoy!  I can't wait to receive it."
"I love my Keurig and use it every day, several times a day. My mum was born in England and is VERY particular about the taste of her tea. I got her to try this and she really liked it. I love it! True tea lovers will like this tea. It is the only K cup tea I will drink."
I love Reese's Peanut Butter.  I had to resort to ordering a half-case online because local stores no longer carry this product.
"Not quite sure why this is called Mocha Java, since the Mocha flavor is lacking.  However, the coffee is quite smooth and it is perhaps one of my husband's favorites.  I on the other hand prefer something with a little more chocolate flavor such as Timothy's German Chocolate Cake. This blend definitely has the hint of choclate that I was looking for when I ordered the Mocha Java but it also has a touch of coconut flavor and a scent that I enjoy.  In Timothy's defense, they don't truly market Mocha Java as a Flavored coffee but rather as a ""medium roast"" blend of ""Ethiopian and Sumatran coffees"".  However, unless you really researched this, the name is misleading."
"Yes, these are a little sticky. But they make up for it by being addictively delicious.<br /><br />These are a yummy alternative to granola bars for those who need GLUTEN-FREE foods."
"I really hesitated to order this because of the reviews but I am SO glad I did. I couldn't be more pleased. Out of 35 cups, I have 23 different flavors to try. Thank you Amazon!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>Dogswell chicken jerky is now made in China.  The FDA has warned against dog food products made in China.  Don't risk it!"
"Got this for 2 months at my local stores retail price with the Amazon subscribe and save program. Then like many other items in the program the price doubled??? That got me looking around. Way to pricey and not really a very healthy dog food from what I have read lately. The dogs ofcourse have liked Pedigree for over a year now, But for this kind of money I want something healthier."
"While the green mountain apple cider have a relatively okay taste, the combination of sugarfree and caramel in this product provided an overpowering sweetness. No one in my office will drink the things."
"This paste is AWESOME!! I got wind of it from an Indian food truck and was dying to figure out how to make it myself, thus went the search for butter curry.  I cannot stress enough how good this is.  I use it for chicken and now have tried it with shrimp; DELISH!!  Will be buying packs and packs of this as often as I can!"
"My baby loves this stuff. It is a great texture and actually reasonably tasty. I like that he gets some protein, and that the flavor combination isn't as boring as some."
"I tried this for the first time recently. My budget was tight, but I was not willing to feed my dog ""junk"" food, so after some searching, ""CSDLS"" seemed like the most bang for the buck. The sales person advised me to buy a smaller bag before diving into the 35 pounder to make sure my dog would eat it. I chuckled and told him my dog has never met a food she doesn't like...until now. Now mind you, I have a lab. Labs love food and will eat just about anything. This is the first food that she is not excited to eat. :( She will eat it just b/c she's starving, but it's with much less enthusiasm. She even stops eating after a few bites, walks away, and then reluctantly finishes. She has never done this in her life. It's too bad. I was hoping she would like this, but now it's back to the more expensive brands."
"This is one of the best tasting coffees around, it has a rich creamy coconut taste.<br />I purchased as a 3 pack sample to try it and I will definitely be ordering a full box soon."
"These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though."
"Have gotten this about 2 years now on subscription. Just cancelled it because the price increases, way too often. I have found using the San Francisco Bay  cups, french roast great and about 40% less and more enviroment friendly."
"I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!"
"Not exactly the highest possible praise, but as something of a coffee snob, I was surprised to find this so palatable.  And really, if you need a caffeine hit, isn't it better to down something that didn't have to be formulated inside of a lab?  Five Hour Energy Drinks, I'm talking to *you*.<br /><br />What's in the can?  Coffee, beet sugar, potassium carbonate and potassium citrate.  Those last two you can buy in the vitamin/supplement aisle of your drugstore, and they do have natural antacid properties - I don't think they are used here as preservatives, but rather to tone down coffee's natural acidity.  I get good balance in the flavor of the coffee, so it's easy to enjoy without the addition of milk - great for me as a lactose-intolerant coffee drinker.  If you happen to already cold-brew in the fridge at home for lower acid, you'll appreciate the difference.  On the other hand, if you're a huge fan of bright, acid-y Central American coffees as opposed to the deeper Sumatrans and Suwalesis, then for you this might be a deficit.<br /><br />I'd keep this around in warm weather to offer iced to guests.  It's true that you can probably brew a better cup, if you start with good beans, but I think the convenience here is worth the price, particularly if you don't normally brew much coffee. Roasted beans kept in storage go stale - FAST.<br /><br />For decades, Illy has enjoyed a reputation for reliable, if not exceptional quality, and I'd sooner have one of these than a Starbucks canned or a McCafe any day. (Even if they did partner with Coca Cola for this latest Issimo line, says the coffee snob.)"
I was desperately in need of these in the shell but they were a little pricey and although not super stale were not the freshest (I bought them way out of season). Served the purpose when purchased though.
"I have a standing order with Amazon for some time now where a case of K cups is shipped to me each and every month at a discounted price.  Amazon has raised their pricing without informing of they're doing so and shipped the case without my approval at the newer higher pricing.  To me, this is bad business and taking advantage of the dedicated consumer.<br /><br />The coffee itself is more than wondeful."
This was a great price for the quantity delivered. Good tasting but not as sweet as Sun Crystals. Recommend<br />for those not needing sweetness.
"It tastes awesome, but ""awesome"" packs 50% sugar by weight. one serving of this is like eating a whole glazed doughnut."
"This flour is very nice in pancakes.  A little goes a long way. I also used it in place of flour in making Apple Crisp, I will try other uses eventually."
"This is a wonderful cubed sugar, some of the sweetest I've ever had.  Shouldn't have, but I ate it like candy.  Reminded me of high end resturaunts from childhood."
"First off i think this is a great value.  The bag is huge and lasts forever even if you make a shake every day.  My husband buys isopure protien and that stuff is so expensive and contains all kinds of sugur ect.  but this hemp protien is great for smoothies.  I like to add it to skim milk, rice milk, coconut milk, some berries, maybe a bannana & i add a tbsp of psyllium as well.  it taste great in my opinion, not like a  sweet sugary smoothie, but like a nutty flavor.  even my kids like to have a little scoup in there milk, they love it!! A great buy :)"
"Excellent product and received in record time...thanks and good job!  Taste is perfect and consistency the same.  The only thing I question is so much plastic is wasted because the container is less than half full each time I've ever received this product.  A container half the size or a slightly larger should be considered, to stop the waste of excess plastic that may end up in landfills if not recycled.  I wrote to the company three years ago and asked if they would consider package modification, but never was acknowledged."
My favorite was the Triscuit Pepper until now. A lot of the other Triscuit brands like Garlic tastes terrible and has hidden MSG. Triscuit Dill is naturally favored with no MSG(: Tastes really good with spray cheese.
"I ordered these just a few days ago.  Haven't used them yet, but like this sellers attention to customer care.  Thanks, by the way I looked and found some other ""gotta have"" stuff in your store so expect me to return.<br /><br />Respectfully,<br />Future Sausage King of Edmond, OK"
I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND ON THE JOB SHE LOVES PEANUT CHEWS. SHE WOULD BUY A BAR VERY DAY.SO I DECIDED TO GET A BAG AND PUT THEM IN A BIG JAR JUST FOR HER TO PUT ON HER DESK. SHE LOVE THEM !!! IT IS NICE TO MAKE SOMEONE SMILE.
"My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.<br /><br />And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat."
"I was excited to purchase this tea and found out thats its not good.  I brewed it on small setting and big, very weak, not of quality.  I have one of the Raspberry and one lemon I have to figure out how to get rid of."
"I love the cereal on which these bars are based, so I wasn't surprised that these are also great.  The only reason it doesn't get a ""5"" is so I don't water-down that rating by making everything I like a ""5.""  Make no mistake - these are great, there's just not something to make the bar stand out in a class by itself.  Perhaps if there was some way to increase some of the nutritional figures without using artificial vitamins, etc., that might do it, but it's still comparable nutritionally to a very good quality brown rice.  You're likely to be very pleased."
"My wife and I just love these instant potatoes.  They are best with evaporated milk or evap. milk and fresh milk (50/50).  We use cholestrol free/sugar free evap. milk and 2 percent fat fresh milk and it comes out really excellent.  Don't chintz on the butter either!  Follow directions exactly and you will be very, very pleased."
"Love, love these K-cups.  I'm a Starbucks junkie and at around 50 cents a K-cup I save tons on not going to my local Starbucks store and buying a caramel macchiato when I can make it myself at home!!!  Now, if Fair Trade would just make K-cups then I'd be all set."
"Could only find at local Shell gas station......now I have a source to buy all I want!  Fast & secure delivery....price is great!  Will order again, and again, etc.,....."
"Excellent cookies, but the packages were all beyond the Best Sold By date... Since I wanted to give some as gifts, t was unable to do so.  Very disappointing."
"I purchased after reading many reviews.  Use on face, chest and hands.  The first application was not dramatic as far as results go; but I use daily and the results are fantastic.  It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!"
The easy pore pouch is a great feature. My 7 month old has not eaten any baby food as fast as he ate the pears and greens. The pouch is easy to close and store for later if needed. The pouch is also microwavable. Overall I love this baby food.
3 out of my 4 cats will not touch this.  Pretty pricey for alot of gravy & grain & little meat.
"A package of coffee that's LARGER than 1 pound, imagine that! And you get 3 of those nice large bags in your order.  Plus the price is extremely reasonable especially for an import.<br /><br />The first thing I noted about this coffee is that it is very tightly vacuum sealed - no air in the bag.<br />When you open the bag you get a lovely waft of fresh ground coffee.<br /><br />The coffee itself is ground extra fine to what is very much like a powder, quite dark in color and even though ground to that gauge is nice and moist with an acceptable amount of oiliness.<br /><br />The extra fine grind makes using a paper filter a necessity - you can use a gold tone filter but it will clog with grounds so must be scrubbed after use and you will, most likely, find grounds in the bottom of your pot.<br /><br />No matter what coffee we brew in our auto drip pot we start the brewing process and then pause it for a short time allowing the grounds to 'bloom' and then restart the brewing until completion.<br /><br />We have found that this coffee as most of the Made in Germany coffees we've tried has a slight acidity and an earthy undertone in the flavor. Not a negative if that appeals to you. We enjoy it after dinner but prefer a lighter roasted bean for our morning cups.<br /><br />As with any coffee, liking this coffee very much or disliking it comes down to personal taste.<br /><br />At the price it's certainly worth trying."
These crackers have great flavor and the subscription price makes them a great value. Late July has great products and this is one of their best.
"When I received this item it was labeled ""Sea Salt."" In  fact, the Sea Salt version of these chips is also described as ""lightly salted,"" so you might think the two were one and the same. However, these are listed as having 115g of sodium per serving, while the Sea Salt version has 135g of sodium per serving. If this matters to you like it matters to me, stipulate that you receive the Lightly Salted version ONLY."
"I bought 4 cases of this because I HEART Housewives/NJ!!  Now I am going to start by saying that black is not my favorite color AT ALL, but I will try anything that is like..you know...healthy organic.  I'm really healthy like that ;  So I invited some of my best girlfriends over for a tasting party and OMG things got CRAY!  I have to add that my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight earlier that day about him not wanting me to wear these really cute shorts that I found on sale at TJ Max that were like short but not THAT short, and I had this really cute top that I wanted to wear with them but he was like ""you look super slutty in those shorts"" and I was all like ""Whatever Ramondo, you wear like those cholo shirts out every day and I don't say anything about that!""  Anyways, point being I was ready to try something new!  So the water arrived and all my girlfriends and I each took a bottle.  My first reaction was...""I don't think i can put something THIS black in my mouth""  But I had spent 55$ a case on this so I just sucked it down (that will show Ramondo LOLOLOLZZZZ....)<br /><br />It sorta tasted like I expected...like dirt water...but like not bad dirt water..like dirt water you drank when you went with your uncle to the river when you were six to go swimming with him and then you would jump in and accidentally drink a little river water.<br /><br />So overall i was pretty please with it but I was really upset about the TJ Max shorts and Ramondo so 2.5 stars<br /><br />XOXOXOXOXOXO-"
"This is my 3rd reorder.<br />I LOVE Tunafish,but after years of trying to eat the crap in the can,<br />I gave up...until I googled BEST TUNA .<br />Thank you,Mr.Google.<br /><br />Wild Planet is just like the Tuna I remember.<br />You actually have to Break it up with a fork.<br />No extraneous floaters and  pieces swimming in stinky water.<br />THIS TUNA IS THE BEST...The PRICE is Terrific.<br />Sorry Charlie"
purchased from this site due to past experience with Green Mountain coffee. It is great coffee a great deal will buy certainly buy again when I need more coffee.
"I love anything ""pumpkin"", so of course this coffee fit the bill.  I find that one cannot go wrong with Green Mountain. All of their seasonal K-cups are great! -Just so you know, I prefer Dunkin'Donuts over Starbucks, so if you are with me on that, you will probably like ""Green Mountain."" I do not like ""bitter"" coffee."
I have cooked with Textured Vegetable Protein for years and use it in my spaghetti sauce instead of ground meat. I've also used it in Chili with beans and soups. I can not tell the difference between it and ground beef as it absorbs the flavors from the sauce. I do not eat meat so this is a good source of protein for me.
"In my opinion, the best tasting coconut water on the market.  All of the types of coconut water I've tried have different tastes, so if you haven't tried this one or many others for that matter, go to the health food store first to see what you like best before ordering on amazon (much cheaper)."
1 star for not selling what is pictured. If you want to sell a small container for a rip-off price that's fine but you should at least take a picture of the small container instead of the largest container you have. Crooks.
"I do not know how the product itself is because I gave it to my sister for Christmas. However, the company said it would be delivered on or by Dec 24 if I ordered on Dec 17 (which I did). It did not come until Dec 26. So, on Christmas day I had to tell my sister what her Christmas present was but that I did not have it yet. This was part of a Sushi making kit that I was putting together for her and some of the other items in it were from this company too."
"My cat cannot get enough of this food - so it must taste great.<br /><br />With this as her regular diet, she gained 3lbs in a year; my vet said this is a fattening food.  I still give her individual pieces of kibble as ""treats"" but I feed her Blue Buffalo weight control now."
I really liked these bars. They are really good. Finished them in a week and would definitely order again. I wish I could find a coupon
"I have been trying to find a nutritious food for my picky 6 pound, 1 year old, terrier/poodle/mutt and runt of the litter. Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an ""emergency"" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has ""pickyness""/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food."
"This product arrived today and I gotta tell ya its better than I expected! You ever walked into a store and smelled those cinnamon pine cones?Thats my best description of it...if I drank tea w sugar I'm pretty sure this tea would taste like a version of those cinnamon red hots candies. Anyway, its pretty dang good!!! :)"
I've been on a low carb diet and bought these.  I wouldn't recommend them.  They aren't bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter.  I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.  In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.<br /><br />The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar.  They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie.
"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.<br /><br />Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased."
it taste really good as long as you don't use too much of it..if you do its really over powering
"I make my loose tea in a coffeemaker that has never been used for coffee, and I use unbleached filters to hold the tea.  The tea is fresh and so flavorful you wont believe it.  There is no dust in this tea as in teabags, just real tea.  I dont understand why loose tea isn't available everywhere, but I am glad to have found this source for it.  The price is very reasonable, especially when compared to other loose teas.  Do a Google search for loose tea and you will found out for yourself."
I really had high expectations of this product but the artificial flavoring just kills it.<br />My wife gets migraines and the artificial flavoring in this product has been reported to make these worse.<br />I just wish I hadn't gotten a double pack.
"OH, these things smell awful BUT the dog loves them.  This will help keep his teeth clean and was recommended by the Vet."
"we love the powdered goat milk taking the place of regular formula! raw goat milk is one of the closest and most nurishing milk to give a baby other then breastmilk, and when we cant get raw milk we go with powdered! it sits well in his belly and digest great! he loves loves loves it!!! i have used this milk for all 4 of my boys and it has proven to be the best formula EVER!!!! would highly recommend to anyone for their baby unless of course you can get the fresh stuff!!LOL"
I had bought a  #2 ceramic filter holder and found<br />these papers are a bit too small for the holder.<br />Wish I had bought the #4 paper.
"My 16 year old cat, little bug has joined that ever growing club of hyperthyroid cats.  While she is super easy to pill, is was clear that hunting her down twice a day to drop a pill down her throat was hurting our relationship.  In addition I wanted it to be easy for someone else to pill her when necessary. These so far have worked like a charm.  As she only gets a quarter tablet I tear the pocket in two and that cuts the cost down.  Amazon's price on these smokes the pet store and the the vet."
"From the several makers of K-cup coffees I've tried, Black Tiger makes the best tasting cup of coffee!  It's robust, yet not bitter or acidic.  It's the perfect morning coffee for me."
"I have yet try to this brand, but all I know is that lentils are the richest bean in fiber.  Here is list of the fiber content in 1/2 cup of the following beans:<br /><br />1.  lentils  8 grams<br />2.  black beans 7.5 grams<br />3.  pinto beans 7.5 grams<br />4.  kidney beans 4.5 grams<br />5.  chickpeas 4 grams<br /><br />It's probably true that canned beans do lose some of their fiber content but not by very much.  And it sure beats the hassle of cooking."
This granola is awesome!  It tastes great and was delivered fresh.  I look forward to trying other flavors but you can't go wrong with this one!
"This is the ONLY vegetarian noodle bowl you can get on Amazon.com, and I would say about 90% of the time, the ONLY vegetarian noodle bowl you will find in most stores (except certain Asian specialty markets).<br /><br />Not only does the noodles taste great, the soup is spicy and wonderful. Price is great on Amazon.com with Subscribe and Save. Keep it up Amazon!"
"Given that Salt & Pepper is my favorite potato chip flavor (specifically Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut for those who might be interested) and I love cashews, I was looking forward to trying these. Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know. This product could easily be delicious if whoever formulated it would put a bit more finesse into it."
We just bought Tassimo Gevalia Expresso 16 pack for $9.99 less 20% off at Bed Bath and Beyond.  Why would anyone pay this price?
You'll love this syrup even if you don't like sugar free stuff.  It doesn't taste like it's sugar free and that's what makes it really good.
"its a little on the dry side but if you use a spray butter on it, it turns out very well and jam, yummy!!"
"this was such a great deal when I purchased it from amazon. I typically buy the generic raisin bran cereal on wholesale and don't purchase the actual brand but the deal was cheaper so I picked this one. Man, it is yummy! It's much better quality and it's just delicious. LOVED THIS!. very yummy."
"This tea is the reason why I bought a Keurig. It's my absolute favorite. I make a cup each morning to take with me to work (anyone who works a 9-5 needs a pick me up!). I usually re-order two boxes every couple of months, and my package always arrives quickly. I'll be buying these k-cups as long as they're available!"
"This tea has a delicious flavor, fresh and light. I love it, and this is a great price. For regular tea drinkers it is a great deal on Amazon's auto-order feature."
"I used to be totally against energy drinks. I thought they were a scam to get people to placebo themselves into a state of awakeness. Then one day, walking the streets of SF, I was handed a complimentary sample of 5-Hour Energy. I threw it into my bag thinking that I'd never use it. A couple weeks later, I was having a hard day and knew I was going to have a long night, so I figured why not try the freebie, it didn't cost me anything anyway.<br /><br />Oh My Gosh it worked so well! It was amazing. I guess I'm more sensitive to it because 1/3 of the bottle kept me going for hours. So I decided it was worth it to buy a dozen so it's cheaper per unit, and I could just store it for my long days.<br /><br />I've tried Berry and Pomegranate, definitely like the Berry flavor much better.<br />Cheers!"
"this is the best popcorn i have ever eaten, much better then the Ricos brand I was getting at sams club, thanks"
"I like this protein powder. On its own it is too sweet and has more caffeine than I should have at one time, so I mix one scoop of it with a scoop of EAS 100% whey chocolate protein powder and it makes the perfect protein drink for me. I use this product daily."
"This is my favorite flavor, I feel like I am on a tropical island, at least for a few seconds."
"My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
"This is the best sugar free candy on the market, hands down! There is no after taste, which is very important to me. Well worth the money. I've tried many other sugar free candy and none of them come close to this one, but don't take my word for it, try it for yourself and you'll see."
"Sustainably caught off the California Coast, packaged as disclosed in a previous review. I feel a tad guilty buying 10 at at time at the local co-op but they are simply the best tasting sardines, distinctive and flavorful. You know you are buying premium product compared to the plethora of sardine purveyors out there: Nordic, Portugal, Mediterranean, etc...The cool waters off the California are well known for sardines"
"On my quest to improve my overall health, I have been on the lookout for the best water I can possibly find so I can flush my system of toxins and, at the same time, have glowing skin.  Although I keep trying different brands, I always come back to ""Fiji"", the natural artesian water from the islands of the same name. ""Artesian"" means that the water is protected inside a volcanic rock formed millions of years ago. Because it's bottle at the source, the water preserves all its minerals literally untouched. The difference is also obvious to the naked eye, when upon looking through the attractive bottle, one can see the clarity and transparency that just makes one want to dive into its purity.<br /><br />Taste-wise it does not dissapoint either. Imported from the distant falls of Viti Levu, Fiji tastes free of all particles and just... fresh! I usually keep a bottle by my desk at work, and use it hot or cold, for tea, hot cocoa, or straight up.<br /><br />The typical analysis in mg/liter states:<br /><br />Silica: 85<br />Calcium: 17<br />Magnesium: 13<br />pH: 7.5<br />Bicarbonates: 140<br />Total dissolved solids: 210<br /><br />Cases are offered at a discount at the company's website for delivery in the USA."
"I've been reading amazing things about Cacao, health benefits, etc., so I thought I would purchase these for my family and see if I couldn't ""work"" them into our routine.  I have to be honest, it really hard as no one in my family (including me) really likes the flavor.  Raw eating is new to me so maybe in a year or so this will be a real treat.  I agree the price and the fact that they are organic is GREAT.  I am still searching for a good idea on how to use them?"
Love this coffee and it was a great price!  I will continue to buy bulk this way if the price stays right.
"When time is short and the family is grumbling for something to eat, a boxed prepackaged meal can be a great way to get dinner handled.  Cook a little chicken and throw in the packaged cheese and veggies and you're good to go.  While not as fantastic as any given home cooked meal, Velveeta's cheesy skillets are easily on par or better than most varieties of the standard chicken/tuna/hamburger helpers available at the supermarket.<br /><br />There are a lot of ways to jazz the meal up or make it go farther for feeding more people, like adding in more vegetables or turning it into a casserole by baking a bread crumb crust on top. Although making it too much more exciting obviously defeats the purpose of having a quick and fast boxed meal sitting in the counter in the first place.<br /><br />For something simple and easy when you don't have time for a prepared meal, the chicken and broccoli cheesy skillet is a tasty and affordable option, it just won't knock your socks off and become your new favorite dinner."
I love these bars.  They are lighter and crisper than the nature valley brand.  Being that they have protein as well they make it a better choice to stave off hunger.
"Love, Love, Love!  I've been using for years, if you haven't tried it, please do.  Great customer service"
I love all the baby food my baby eats but this tasted horrible.  I think the ascorbic acid in the bananas makes it taste funny.  It's a little bit bitter and doesn't really taste like a fresh mushed up banana.  I'm going to try giving him fresh banana instead.  Don't stock up until you know they love the taste.
Good product. It's tasty and it's healthy for you. Great texture compared to other whole wheat pasta. Good amount of pasta in one bag.
I hadn't used millet before - I used it in soups as a thickner.  It doesn't taste to much so takes on the taste of whatever you put it in.
"If you compare this to store prices, you are getting a great deal, this package has 24 packs!  My dog is only 5, but she loves this food.  This dog food actually looks like real food, it is not that mushy food that comes out the shape of the bag/can.  I would defiantly recommend this."
"Exported from Japan, this is a very good ""fake"" wasabi powder (nearly all tubed and powdered wasabi is actually horseradish). 25g of powder is a lot, so this can will last you a long long time, making this a very economical choice for sushi lovers. I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product. Ingredients listed on the label: horseradish, mustard, Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, and artificial colors (Blue #1, Yellow #4). Blue #1 (Brilliant Blue FCF) is a commonly-used synthetic dye derived from petroleum. You can see it on the right side of the label in the photo if you read Japanese: chakushoku-ryou, coloring agent.<br /><br />Another excellent brand is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNU1X"">Hime Powdered Wasabi (Japanese Horseradish)</a>, or if you prefer it in a ready-to-use tube, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YGSAU"">S&B - Wasabi in Plastic Tube (Family Size) 3.17 Oz.</a>, a very popular brand."
"Still in process of narrowing down my personal preferences. Medium strong which is a good thing, but I get an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about - might be me."
This juice is a wonderful rehydrator. Some people swear by it's ability to help dissolve kidney stones. I've been using it for that purpose for over a year and have not had any more stones. Drink it regularly. It tastes great cold.
"Decent price...arrived on time.  No complaints here.  We will continue to purchase this item.<br />My daughter loves her ""goat milk"".  :)"
"These chips are VERY GOOD!! I couldn't stop eating them. They didn't last very long.<br /><br />The reason I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I think the bags are a little hard to open. I'm not sure why they need to make a potato chip bag that sturdy, you may need some scissors on hand to open them much easier."
I chose this product as I am not crazy about chocolate flavoured products. This goes well with coffee and good if you are in a hurry. It keeps me full till lunch time. I worry about the fat content however. I probably would need an input from a dietician regarding that.
"These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase."
"are glucose syrup and evaporated cane juice? Just because these ingredients are organic doesn't mean they're healthy. I worry that we are giving our kids the implied message that sugar is good. We already eat a ton of sugar, as a nation, and I don't have to mention what our obesity rates for kids are.<br /><br />Why can't we get a wholesome alternative that doesn't have a ton of sugar in it?"
"My local supermarket has these available at its olive bar for $7.99 a pound, or about 50 cents an ounce, a typical olive bar price.  This Amazon deal works out to about 37 cents an ounce, which is a significant if not dramatic savings, assuming you're on Prime.<br /><br />I compared taste with some of the supermarket olives and they seemed the same to me. I suspect they all come from the same two or three farmer co-ops in Sicily."
"This product does not work well at all.  We bought black and orange to decorate Halloween cookies.  Even without microwaving the bottle, as the directions suggest to make the product softer, the liquid just poured out.  We kneaded the icing and shook the bottle repeatedly thinking that the icing must have separated, but no.  The icing was so runny, it just ran off the cookies and looks terrible.  I do not see how this product could be used to make lines, as the image on the bottle suggests.  We also tried making black dots for eyes, and the icing just spread into black blobs.  Don't waste your money."
"I really enjoy this coffee as does my school-teacher daughter.  My husband REALLY dislikes flavored coffee so it's so great to pop in the Hazelnut for me and then let him have his choice of ""un-flavored"" coffee."
Justin's Nut Butter is the best almond butter you can buy.  I first learned about it an Starbuck's and I couldn't find it at any store.  So I looked it up on amazon.com and it was cheaper.  The order was quick and easy.
"Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store."
"I like this high-fiber cereal better than the original All Bran cereals, who are too dry and stringy for my taste.  Even though, I usually mix in some other kind of cereal with these, to make them more interesting.<br /><br />But the main reason for adding this review is that I was happy to find out a month ago that I could buy these at Amazon at a substantially lower price than the grocery store ($3.50 instead of $5.00).  Except I just tried to order more and Amazon no longer seems to carry them.  They are still available through third-party stores for ridiculous prices, such as $10/box (I don't see why they even bother).  I am hoping they will come back!"
"I had tried this coffee before, it is wonderful.  Smooth and rich, full flavored, but not too bold. I would recommend it to anyone."
I love this stuff.  My dad brought some home from his home town in New York.  Love it.  Great marinade.  We skewer beef or moose cubes after letting them sit in marinade.  Love it!
BEWARE!! you are getting a good deal on these because the cans are dented and the contents taste metallic. they cant's sell these damaged products in whole foods so they sell them to you on amazon. blech!! disgusting!! tastes like the nickels and pennies you are saving when you shouldve just gone to the store to get your coconut juice
This product is very healthy and keeps your digestive system moving in a gentle way.  My doctor said it was safe for me to take.
"I bought this for my boss.  I liked it particularly because there was some unusual stuff included, which makes it a little bit of a better gift in my opinion.  It's a great gift for someone you aren't close to or aren't sure what to buy for."
Ordered from The Candy Peddler.  The candy came fast via priority mail and was fresh.  It came as two 4.5 lb bags in one box.  It reminded me of when I could buy Mike and Ikes though the vending machine for a quarter. Awesome product.
"Hands down the best hot chocolate to date for the Keurig universe. Sweet, creamy and super tasty. I enjoy it with a splash of Caramel creamer (milk/cream natural creamer, not oils)"
"Great taste - even the grand kids like it. Great taste, sums it up, plus it being gluten-free, wheat free and dairy free."
"I never imagined I would ever know what old people taste like...yeah, I was wrong... My advice, just walk away from this one."
"Enjoyed the rich Cacao taste. This high quality chocolate so i read is good for fat burning in the stomach, along with some exercise of course. Great snack.....loved it."
"When I was young, a while ago, sardines didn't come three or so to the flat can as they do now; they were small fish, young sprat. The very best were so tiny that they were packed crossways and two layers deep, lightly smoked, in oil. These still are, and at the best price I've seen in years. The taste is utterly different from the cheap supermarket brands. If sardines could be elegant, these would be."
You  won't believe how delightful this is.  I've tried many coconut waters but this wins hands down. it reminds me of sticking a straw in the coconuts on the beach in brazil.  Happiness truly is inside.
I purchased this item a month ago and i drink a cup morning and night. I love it! I drink it with clover honey...
I'm not sure why somone would sell this for $30+ dollars on amazon.com when you can get it at the actual store fo 12.99 and get it online for the same price.  Am I missing something here??
"these three cheese potaoes are a family favorite of ours.the cheese sauce is creamy and excellent quality taste. i use my microwave to make these.the potatoes cook up to be tender, my kids love it when i but bacon in these to."
"I usually find these at my local health food store.  It's a great, tasty product, which I think most people would enjoy.<br /><br />They are great for entertaining when you have family over or friends."
It seems like they boxed up all the dented cans at the natural food store for selling on Amazon.  They taste great.  We had to get rid of a few cans out of concern for how dented they were.
Son really likes these. He eats them for snack all the time. However now that he is 1 he doesnt like them as much
"We enjoy Timothy's French Roast, but many of the K-Cups came damaged (mostly creased) to the point that they were ""throw aways""."
It was wonderful to find these coffee beans; we've been looking for them since we returned from our trip to Italia.  The wonderful aroma and flavor takes us back to the little kitchens of our cousins and sidewalk cafes of Rome and Bologna.
"I thrive on these mashed potatoes, and also the equally excellent Betty Crocker Loaded Mashed Potatoes. I think I can hear an inner voice of my mother telling me 60 years ago that I shouldn't like prepared foods, but I ignore that voice a lot. These are extremely easy to make (I heat my water for four minutes in an 1100 watt microwave), and they taste pretty good just as they are.<br /><br />Of course, I rarely leave things just as they are. I sometimes add in some milk with my water. It gives the potatoes a richer taste. I also dice various versions of Spam, mix in some canned string beans and pitted black olives, heat everything up, and mix it in with the potatoes. That way it becomes a quick and easy entree.<br /><br />I suppose homemade mashed potatoes have their points. Just try making them when you're over 60. This product starts looking pretty attractive at that point. And the texture is actually better than the best homemade potatoes I've had (most homemade versions usually just end up lumpy, though).<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend these. Don't pay attention to those inner voices telling you otherwise. This is a winner."
I purchased this to put in lunches boxes for my family and me.  It tastes fine - just like hidden valley always does...but my box was very close to the expiration date.
"We have two small Yorkies. They are like our children, and we sure do pamper them, most of the items I buy on Amazon and are on my list are doggie treats. We first bought these for a higher price at a well known pet store. We bought the filet mignon flavor.<br />Then I went online to see where I could get them cheaper.  Thank you Amazon, you are always there when we need you.<br />We want to give our girls nothing but the best and only treats that have good ingredients and are made in the USA this is very important to us.<br />We buy the regular size pack of 6 and then I easily cut them into thirds. Boy does it help, the treat is a great size for them, and they love them. They even smell good to us!<br />Thanks Amazon for carrying these wonderful healthy treats for those of us who love our pets."
"I first tried these with my twins when they were starting on solid food.  I figured they liked yogurt, so they'd probably like these.  And they did, but only for the first couple of bags.  Fast forward a few months when they spotted an unopened bag and pointed... now they love them!  Afternoon snack often features ""yoga melts"" along with a happy dance."
Happy to have found this product on Amazon.com at a reasonable price.<br />These oats are just delicious.  Not mushy like so many.  Don't miss the cookie recipe on the inside of the box. Especially good with craisins instead of raisins.
"I love green teas and have tried many different kinds. Sometimes it's a hassle to make tea at work or on the go, which is why I gave Ito En Sencha Shot a try. I was very happy with it. You can drink it hot or cold. When it is hot it is a smooth, earthy and strong tea. Perfect for mornings. When cold it is about twice as strong and almost tastes like grass. Which I think is good in the afternoon. You will get a boost of energy and get a full feeling after drinking this. It is a wonderful drink and it is really good for you!"
I love this babyfood.  It is a great combination of the 3 fruits.  My daughter is 6 months old and she really seems to enjoy this one as well as the pear and mango.  This combined with the spoon that screws onto the end is great.  All you have to do is throw them in your diaper bag and go.  Super convenient.  Would definitely recommend.
"This is NO innocent product - my dog got one of those stuck on his throat and is now almost dying - esophageal surgery, aspiration pneumonia and other complications - and now I just hope he makes it and I can afford it - I already spent over $3,000 - and all because of a treat that claims to be highly digestible and natural."
"These taste really good!<br /><br />The primary nut is almond, although there is a background of peanuts, and occasionally cashew. The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum."
"While I swear by this product and have ordered it several times, I did not find it well packed this time.  Usually it's come in a box, but this time the 6 packs were just jammed into a padded envelope so the actual pockets were smashed....still usable, just not in great shape.  I think the supplier should go back to using a box."
This Gluten free pasta is the best ever. Tried many other brands but did not like the taste. This brand is delicious! Well worth the price!
"Be warned that these chips have NO SALT.  That is what I want, so that I can taste the interesting flavor of this unique variety of corn, unadulterated by unhealthful sodium.  The blue color is not a artificial chemical coloring, but healthful anthocyanins.  This corn is a great source of these compounds, which have been demonstrated to have immense and healthful benefits.  Highly recommended, especially for corn lovers!<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]"
These chips are GREAT!  They came in a timely manner and were nice and fresh.  I can't wait until they are in stock again so we can purchase more!
The bearS were great and the thought an concept was excellent what brought the rating down for me were the treats.  They were reported to me as being not that good
My Springer Spaniel enjoys chewing on this toy with or without the treat. It holds up well to her hard chewy. The down side to this toy is how expensive the treats are.
"As I have ventured into my 30s, my hair has become much flatter and is losing its bounce.  I have what ""appears"" to be thick hair but really, I have a LOT of hair that is made up of lots of thin strands.  I figured trying out Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty volumizing boost nourishing conditioner couldn't hurt.  I thought the smell was pleasant and not overly strong.  It rinsed out nice and clean without any kind of left over residue that would need lots of extra rinsing.  I didn't notice much of a boost to my volume after the first use.  My hair felt nice but that was it.  I don't wash my hair every day, just every other day, but on the second wash and condition, I did notice my hair looked more voluminous- not a huge amount of volume but definitely wasn't my usual flat hair!  So yay!  A little volume is better than flat and I am good with that.  The price (less than $5) isn't too shabby either!"
"The coffee storage drawer fits perfect under the Keurig.  Very well made, hold a lot, keeps thing organized.  Love it."
"I am an aspiring natural bodybuilder, so am always trying to find good food choices. Compared to nutella, this blows it right out of the water, half the carbs and sugar and almost similar taste. However, this chocolate hazelnut butter has a salty like aftertaste. I'm afraid they use the sea salt so much (to prevent oil separation) that it messes up the potential of the flavor. I will try other Justin's butters and maybe I will find a tastier one, because this flavor wasn't certainly ""all that"". Worth a try, but don't expect it to be out of this world."
"Plum Organics make super tasty ""green"" foods for baby.  I had been having difficulty in getting my daughter to eat anything green (broccoli, peas, spinach, etc...) but she LOVES this!!  I even tried it and its good.  Tastes mostly like apples but I can see the broccoli in it"
"I recently dined at the Melting Pot Fondue restaurant. I ordered this yummy martini, and it was so good, I asked for the recipe. They were very kind to share it with me, but said I would NEVER find the secret ingredient Monin raspberry syrup. Well, that drink was so good, I was determined to lay my hands on this syrup! Luckily, I found it on Amazon!! Here is the recipe:<br /><br />Lemon Raspberry Martini<br /><br />2 oz Limoncello<br />1/2 oz Grey Goose vodka<br />1/4 oz Monin Raspberry syrup<br />1 oz cranberry juice<br />1/2 oz sweet sour mix (liquid)<br /><br />Mix all ingredients together in a shaker with lots of ice. Strain into two martini glasses. Add a twist of lemon and ENJOY!!!"
"Had this on automatic order.  3 orders ago most bars crumbly, 2 orders ago most bars crumbly, last order stale and crumbly.  Reported this but no response.  Unfortunate since when previously ordered most bars intact and fresh.  Must be a shipper problem?  No longer on automatic reorder.  Will purchase elsewhere."
This mac 'n' cheese is adorable with all the bunny and carrot shapes. The quality is also very good. But I feel like it tastes very flat.
Numi teas are the best. This flowering tea is my favorite flavor of the flowering teas. It's a white tea which is delicate tasting with a hint of lavander and hibiscus. I drink alot of different varties of teas and this is my favorite. It may seem like alot of money to spend on tea but it's worth it. Anything that is organic and healthy is always more but always worth it. Plus each flower can be brewed three times and each pot taste just as strong as the pot before it. I love this tea and recommend it to everyone.
"I remembered these from the 70's.  We used to buy these for snacks and they were good.  This is a product that has been able to stand the test of time.  I ordered these last year and was a little worried that I would remember them better then they are.  Nope just as good.  They are for people who can't have nuts but want a nut flavor in a snack.  Crunchy, salty and nutty describes these.  I ordered for a friend at work and we split.  She shared her's with others but I kept mine and snacked when I was temped to reach for the chips.  They are easy to carry in a baggie in your purse so you can have them around when the urge strikes.  If you remember these from years ago they haven't changed, just as good.  You won't be dissappointed."
"I took away one star because I have never been a fan of plain sweet tea. I have always felt that tea needs a bit of lemon, or some other background flavor.  However, I did enjoy the beverage I made with this. The liquid that comes out needs little agitation. I used a 2 second shot, feel free to use more. I liked this, and plan to get more."
"These are a great, healthy snack that I can feel good about giving to my kids.  They really like the taste and texture.  I love the packaging too because I can just keep several in my purse for those ""hunger emergencies!"""
"Although they are a good idea in theory, these bottles are much much smaller than I thought a mini bottles would be. We ended up having to buy another set of hot sauces because it was just embarrassing to give these as a gift alone."
These are really delicious.  The texture is awesome.  My 2 1/2 year olds loved them - the only problem was they were gone in about 3 days!
I received a Keurig coffeemaker for Christmas and needed some way of storing the K-cups.  This drawer is ideal for storing the K-cups without using up too much counter space.  It fits under the coffeemaker and is very handy.  I'm quite happy with my purchase.
"Probably like many folks I was swayed by the quantity and price, especially if ordering with the option to reorder in another couple of months for a good savings.  BUT, unfortunately the flavor is quite lacking.  There is just a hint of the blue raspberry, with the main flavor seeming to be almost synthetic add a little sweetness.  I love gummies but will be a wary of purchasing an Albanese gummy again.  These will certainly last a long time, but I cannot recommend this product to other folks."
"My baby liked it, so i like it, but it was kinda sour.<br />Pear and wild blueberries are much better :) and has 1 gr less sugar!"
"I usually use two packages of the mix and bake the mix in a 9 X 13 cake pan.  It is easy to mix up and can be frozen for eating later on.  Of course, they must be refrigerated but travel well for on-the-road meals.  I highly recommend this mix to the chocaholics out there!"
"...give this product 5 stars.  Yeah, it's not Star****s, but it's a quality cup of frothy Joe that will start the engine with smooth creaminess.  Plenty hot, but not a lot of coffee (don't use your mammoth ""venti"" cup, unless you use 2 of each disk, and even then...), it's nice to havethe option of using just the espresso disk if you need a jolt."
"My husband and I both love this stuff. It's great as a full meal for two or as a side. I crave Mac so badly when I'm watching what I eat, so this is the perfect solution."
"I have a friend with young twins and these purees were well recieved. They are in a nice pouch, which is cool since those glass jars do occasionally break. And they must have tasted good, as all the packets are gone now."
I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.
"We are northwest coffee snobs.  My husband makes our coffee each morning with our espresso machine.  It makes us happy.  But we have done alot of travel in the last six months.  We had a system of grinding our beans and doing a cup at a time with our coffee that we brought with us.  We ran out in the middle of not coffee country.  We did find a Starbucks and got some Via to tide us over.  It isn't the Americano my husband does for us at home, but it has become a good substitute when we are traveling.  Still love our own beans...but this is good.  Certainly not like any other instant I have tasted...much, much, much better."
"Our Miniature Dachshunds love this toy. It is a favorite to grab as they run by with the other dogs chasing them, play tug of war with, or just give it a good shake.  All natural animal behavior.  Great fun and well made with 2 squeakers. Machine washable and still squeaks. I highly recommend this toy.<br /><br />Aureus Dachshunds"
"This conditioner really softened my hair. I left it on for more than the recommended 30 minutes though. I left it on for over 4 hours, but it really did soften and silken my hair and I love the way it smells. It works great in conjunction with the Clear Shampoo, but overall, I would use the conditioner and leave it on for a long time. It would probably be even better if I had a heated cap, but it still works great."
"The second item in the ingredients list is coconut oil, and then vegetable shortening (palm oil).  One serving (4 crackers) has 3.5 grams of saturated fat. Out of 80 calories, 30 calories are saturated fat. Mostly fat, sodium and carbs, no fiber.  They are not buttery as advertised; they just taste greasy with little flavor."
"Made aware of GREEN Darjeeling by a present; looking for a replacement, found this online; Unbelievably inexpensive; Chanced it. Winner! Very satisfactory everyday green tea."
"I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong.  This stuff is like eating pure SALT.  Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT."
This Product Is the only healthy Snack food that tastes good. This is so heathy I can eat the entire bag and it is only 330 cal. Even a bag of lite butter microwave popcorn has more calories.
"This was a Christmas gift for my Grandparents since I live out of state. I wanted to get them something that would be unique from Texas. They did not say they had any problems, and they said that they loved it!"
"If you like spicey, you'll love this sausage. It keeps forever, it very tasty and<br />coupled with some cheese and crackers is a wonderful snack."
I purchased these for the convenience factor. I primarily make all my own baby food but don't like to take homemade food while out and about so I purchased these for when we are running errands. My little one doesn't seem to mind them but he has only had a few of the flavors. I decided to go with Earths Best because I wanted an organic product. I know some are worried about the BPA used in the lids but unfortunately I think BPA is used on all jars and cans and I wasn't able to find an alternative product that didn't use it. I have found that my local Walmart and Target sell these for a little cheaper at only $0.54 a jar.
"My wife and I were a little worried about finding the correct pods for our pod coffee machine and when it came time to get more coffee it was either go expensive and stick with the manufacturer's brand or try out Baronet.  Fortunately it works perfectly, there's no problem with the pods fitting and the taste is very smooth.  Even the aroma off this coffee is very nice, you might even be fooled based on the aroma that it was fresh ground.  So overall a good coffee at a good price!"
Arrived on time.  What a deal !!! So glad I could find this product on amazon !  I used this when i feel like im getting sick<br />Thanks !
"Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel. It's not as good as freshly made espresso but it's not bad at all. I do prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY"">illy issimo cappucino</a> as a treat."
Our little 10lb dog loves! these dingo treats. She worries them until she gets all the red chicken bits out and then gives the rest to our Labrador Retriever who treats them like a 5 minute bubble gum treat. Works out all around!
"My original review was 1 star because I believe that I got a bad batch. I kept trying it and finally it started tasting good. It is the strongest K Kup on the market. With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money. Be warned, if you do not like strong coffee you will need to use the highest level on your Keurig or you will think it is too strong. If you want the strongest, this is the one you need to get."
"I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!"
I love this product!  All the flavor and protein and no oil and less cholesterol.  What's not to love?  It mixes well in shakes and (obviously) tastes just like real peanut butter!<br /><br />I'll be buying this ASAP.
This is a great-tasting tea! The taste is not too strong or overpowering and not too weak. I will be purchasing more.
"I have pretty big hands and a 50 pound dog. These bags have never ripped or torn and are the perfect size. In the few instances that I have fed my dog cheaper food, these bags barely were enough, but for his normal Science Diet, they're perfect."
"Product is exactly like the boxes you see in the stores, comes in individually sealed containers.  Pomegranate is the only flavor of Five Hour Energy that doesn't taste like butt.  Great pick-me-up for those dragging work days!"
My local grocery retailer used to carry these pickles and i got hooked. Then all of a sudden they stopped carrying them. I went on a hunt and found them on line. I traveled to eastern Europe when i was a teenager and these pickles remind me of the ones they had over there. They are very very good.
"It did take a while for this Miso to get in and it came in four days after the arrival date listed as they sold out and didn't update the listing, however the seller was quick to address the issue and give a partial refund, which was great and remedied the issue.<br /><br />The packaging is kind of flimsy, but works well enough. I got a chance to taste a bit of the miso yesterday and it's delicate and slightly sweet and just a tad salty, which is perfect for my purposes. I was mostly using it for a homemade vegan cheese spread and also going to try and make a vegan version of salted caramel using miso instead of butter.<br /><br />Overall I think it's a great value and exactly what I was looking for."
"Understood this to be sugar-free jello when I ordered;  received regular jello, then discovered item was non-returnable."
"I bought this dog food initally because I like everything that I have tried from Newmans Products for humans. So, I thought that my Pug, Chloe may like Newmans also. Well, she sure does, there is no turning up her nose at it. I get it delivered regualry, so this negates the need to make a special trip to get Dog food.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/12/15  the last two bags I recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea. I only found out today when I took her to the vet, and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food. Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.<br /><br />I will return to this dog food in a few months......she ahs liked it so much, but will wait for a bit."
"For the informed thinker consumer...<br /><br />WHAT!!<br /><br />When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch. So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases. Whay are they eatting...? I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening.""<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers."
But I loved it! Delicious and not too many calories! Tasted fresh and crispy. Portions were perfect! Would buy again.
I bought this product because the Senseo pods I usually use were unavailable. The coffee from these pods is so weak that I had to use two to get a halfway decent cup of coffee. If I could use three I would've. Thankfully the Senseo pods are available again and I'm definitely going back to them.
"I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas."
"How they can advertise this product as ""healthy"" when it contains hydrogenated oil is beyond me. Clearly they have sold their souls to the devil. Because the FDA (also in the devil's pocket) allows products to advertise ""no trans fat"" when the amount of trans fat per serving is .5 g or less, these people can get away with lying to the American public. Weight Watchers is also to blame for endorsing ANY product with hydrogenated oil in it.<br /><br />READ YOUR LABELS CAREFULLY, FOLKS: corporations don't care about your health."
"I feel guilty eating these they are so good! Moist, chewy and just sweet enough but not too sweet. I will get this again."
"My dogs loved the dog food,and they are normally very picky eaters. Their coats are shiny, much more shiny than usual,they eat less yet get full benefits without having to feed tons of it, like a cheap dog food requires, stools are formed, and the amount of stools much less because the dogs are actually able to absorb the nutrients without all the useless waste ingredients in many dog food products. I highly recommend the Diamond Dry dog food."
"This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works."
"this is the best coffee(in pod form) I've ever tasted!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ACQHDA"">Baronet Coffee Creme Brulee Medium Roast (140 g), 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3)</a>"
This is for my wife to help her with her diabetis. They work great and she says that they fill her up and taste wounderful.
"this little bar hits the spot  in middle of the afternoon when you're craving something  to make it  through to dinner.  also a great on-the-go treat.... soft and gooey with a bit of chocolate and crunch,  what more  could you want?"
"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."
"Wolfgang Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut is the best K-Cup Hazelnut and I have tried them all. We ordered this large pack, because we sadly found out that Wolfgang Puck is discontinuing many (not all) of their K-Cups, including this flavor. Buy this while you can!"
"My local food co-op had a sale on various tortas de aceita from Ines Rosales.  I picked up some of the rosemary and thyme as well the cinnamon.  While I like the cinnamon flavor a bit better than the rosemary and thyme, both are very good.  Each box has six individually wrapped (in wax paper) tortas.  I like to place a couple in the oven for a few moments before eating them.  The rosemary and thyme flavor is a great soup or salad accompaniment.  If you want a treat to pair with a tea, go for the aforementioned cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />I will also note that these appear to be a hard-to-find item.  Before locating them at my co-op, I didn't even know they existed and I frequently pick up foods from the international foods sections of large grocery store chains and at local ethnic groceries.  My co-op sells these for 5 dollars a box.  I purchased them on sale for 3 dollars.<br /><br />These tortas are made in Spain."
The pill pockets were all broken up into little pieces.  I have to put them together and wrap them around the capsules.  Very inconvenient!!
"I was very disappointed with the order.  It didn't have the flavors advertised in the picture.  They substituted  flavors I didn't want or like and left out the ones I was really wanting.  They also just threw them in the box,bad packaging.  I felt they were getting rid of excess flavors they weren't selling or had plenty of and left out the special ones in the photo.  I will never order K cups here again.  I feel I have wasted my money.  If  had wanted gingerbread..I would have ordered it..now I am stuck with flavors I really don't like."
"As a former St*rbucks drinker, I find I'm always looking for coffee that's ""just a little stronger"". Jet Fuel fills that need nicely. I can finally drink a good strong cup of coffee without going broke.<br />EDIT 5/6/10<br />I have returned to edit this review after trying Green Mountain's REVV. I am dropping this review to 3 stars because REVV is just so much better.<br />I found jet fuel to be a little bitter. The first time I drank it I went a little heavy on the half & half and didn't notice it. Over time the bitterness becomes quite distinct.<br />I have found that I much prefer REVV for the caffeine kick it provides while still being incredibly smooth."
"I actually buy directly from the Runa website as their prices are a little better. This tea is amazing, I used to drink coffee like a mad women now I drink 1-2 cups and then it's the Guayusa tea. I actually can feel the difference when I drink this tea, energized but not jittery, focused and the taste of this tea is like no other. Besides supporting these local farmers buying this tea also supports the rainforest as this tea is grown under shade. I can not say enough good things about this tea and highly recommend this product...."
"So this item is decribed as a red barn bully sticks - sticks not stick - is is only 1 stick.  The price with shipping comes out to $10.63 for 1 bully stick, not worth it.  It has the worst smell ever I actually took it from my dog and threw it away.  Beware this item is garbage"
My husband and I traveled to Spain and we enjoyed olives with all our meals.... they were great tasting... finally I got someone to tell me what made these green olives so different... they were stuffed with anchovies... can not be... I don't eat anchovies... but that was it... and we were hooked.... so glad to find them we never go without them in our house... and each time I taste them they take me back to Spain and a wonderful trip....
"At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous."
Supposed to work to balance calcium and magnesium after hard exercise.<br />Helps in relieving muscle cramps.<br />Flavor is a tart orange.
"My wife loves this oatmeal,no sugar and added ingredients . Easy to make,she boils water for tea and since its hot pours into bowl with instant oatmeal,adds raisins ,perfect oatmeal."
"I know little about salt, but wanted to upgrade from average table salt. I am happy with this. I enjoy using it on food, and also as a mouth rinse with water. While I am not qualified to attest to the quality of this salt, I feel good having it in my kitchen, and will definitely repurchase. There is something about Himalayan Salt that makes me confident having it."
"Full disclosure: my doctor is one of the people responsible for bringing this product to market in the US. He had been telling me about monk-fruit based sweeteners for a few years prior to Nectresse being produced, so I was really excited to test out this sample.<br /><br />I've added this to berries and smoothies, so far, and all I can say is two thumbs up. No aftertaste, micro-granules dissolve quickly, and it's great to not be worrying about this being an artificial sweetener. Recently I thought I'd try cooking and baking with xylitol, let's just say there were mixed reactions to that. Xylitol, even in small amounts, can give you wicked bad gas. Nothing like that with Nectresse. I'm hopeful that they'll offer bulk quantities soon. Due to its concentrated sweetness, I imagine baking with it might present some logistical challenges, but if you've ever used stevia or any other non-bulking sweetener, then you already understand about that."
These little chocolate bites give you the pleasing sensation of chocolate - without the guilt of the sugar calories!!  Great job Murray!!
I got this for my diabetic father in law.  When I tasted it I wished I had gotten myself a jar or two.  It's tart but I don't like sickenly sweet jams.  It has a wonderful taste.
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001KH4AI"">Cherry Jelly 9.6 ounce</a><br /><br />I searched the supermarkets in my area for cherry jam and jelly, but none was available.  I decided then to order some from Amazon.  Lucky me! I chose Grama's Cherry Jelly and Grama's Cherry Jam, and my husband and I agreed that it was by far the best we'd ever tasted. The product is made with sour cherries, but the jam and jelly are sweet as can be.  If you like jam, Grama's is generous to include many pieces of luscious cherries.  They don't skimp. The jelly is clear as a jewel and tastes as good as homemade.<br /><br />I tried another brand of cherry jelly, and it was on the sour side.  It wasn't at all what you would like to spread on a hot piece of toast.  It is so nice to find a product that excels like Grama's does.  Next time, I'll order several jars."
Cost was $48 at time of review.  Only $25 at other sites .... buy elsewhere!  Sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two. I will be comparison shopping a little more now.
I tried this tea while on vacation in Boston.  I fell in love with it.  When I got home I looked everywhere for it but had no luck.  I gave up trying and my husband surprised me with the huge sampler box for Easter.
This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.
Keeps the dog's teeth nice and white. Smells like it is filled with minerals and all kinds of good stuff. Highly recommended by vets. Works well for us.
"They were cheaper than any other place I've seen them at, and my dog loves them! She starts drawling since she sees me grab the bag!"
"When it comes to a body wash, I want something that's going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don't want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that's on the masculine side of things and isn't overly floral.<br /><br />Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I'd give it a try and see how it works.<br /><br />So far, it's pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.<br /><br />The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you're getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).<br /><br />As for the scent, it's fairly subdued and not overpowering.<br /><br />A nice combination."
"Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal."
I love this product! I have been taking wheatgrass for over a year and this is by far my favorite way to take it. Many of the other flavors are good too but this one mixes so easily with just milk. I also add this to protein shakes for a quick and easy way to get a helping of wheatgrass. I have found that it is best to first mix with a little water as it helps the wheatgrass mix better.
this product is good for laughs  my daughters and i got alot of laughs watching their friends and each other taste them  they do not taste good in anyway
My experience with KIND branded products has been positive all around -- my opinion is that they do not skimp on ingredients or quality.  I am using the grain clusters as a snack throughout the day and also as a mix-in for yogurt.  They are not over the top on sweetness -- the balance is just right.
"I brough mine in Costco is cheap there for only like $7. compare to $20+ amazon charge, is great snack, has NO Soldium and lower fat content since is made up like 50-60% soy nuts.  Just careful at portion size, this are great snacks in my opinion."
We both love the powdered eggs from long ago so much we were happy to find these and take them camping. They are good with cheese and bacon in a burrito or to add to cakes etc.
"Good product at reasonable price.  In terms of taste and use, very much like non-organic products.  Price is right in line with non-organic tea bags."
"Maggie gets one Mini Chicken and Sweet Potato chip at dinner.  After we sit down at the table and pray I ask Maggie what she wants and she immediately runs to the cupboard where her chips are located, lays on the floor and waits for her treat.  She loves them and they keep her busy while we are having dinner."
I am glad that you had the Chicken Won Ton Soup in stock.  This is my favorite soup and I enjoy it very much.  Keep up the good work and Thank you again.
"It does not taste bad, but I thought I was purchasing something substantial, not just sweet chocolate flavored water"
It's a rich dark chocolate with a creamy chocolate middle. My wife loved it... a great mother's day gift. I hid 3 of the packages under the bed to surprise her again when the first bag ran out.
"My husband and I were introduced to Market Spice Tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in Seattle.  We loved it and, upon our return to Jamesville, NY, begain to regularly order it.  Many of our friends now order it, too.  It is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer.  23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea!"
"Got a shelter dog back in November... Bichon Frise.  We have been thru 7 different brands of food and also boiling chicken and rice for him as well. His digestive system is a mess, and recently we learned his pancreas  numbers were off as well. This is why we decided to go low fat.<br /><br />It has been 12 days and the improvement is remarkable. We finally have good poop. It's a miracle!  PLUS he liked it right away as well.<br /><br />I researched dozens of dog foods over the last 6 months, and recently at least 6 low fat dry foods. This one appeared to be the best, and it is definitely the best for our dog!  We are VERY HAPPY with our choice. Plus it magically comes to the door via UPS."
"Once again, hello from Venezuela. Ocasionally we get canned salmon in water from Chile here, BUT it is rather salty and VERY pricy, and the Crown Prince product from Amazon is way less expensive even with the Miami-Venezuela freight factored in. The Crown Prince salmon in human recipes actually requires a ""pinch"" of salt to really bring out the flavor, but my 9 indoor cats love it plain!. Will definitely reorder for both cats and guardian!"
"I've only tried the raspberry so far. They are awesome. Naturally sweet and relatively healthy. I just ordered my second case and they came in only a few days later, amazon has really fast shipping (being free doesn't hurt either). I'll never stop ordering these things for as long as they're sold on here."
"I drink this tea every morning and have it on automatic order for a box of six packages every month.  I do find that I have to steep it just a little longer in order to get the pretty redish pomegranate color and flavor to come through. A friend calls it fruit juice.  I wouldn't go that far, but it does have a lovely flavor. It is my favorite Stash Tea."
"I can't say enough nice things about Eagle Pack brand dog foods, especially their holistic line.  Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."
Found the product to work perfectly fine in my machine. Never got stuck and<br />always removed itself with ease. Quality of coffee is good not great. But at<br />this price it is a no brainer. I can make a double for far less than Nespresso<br />charges for a single expresso. Competition is good..I do not like operating<br />under a monopoly were the price is fixed and never varies with demand. Take<br />notice Nespresso.
So how does this review work with a title like that? Mainly because when you have 100 slim jims at your disposal. You are likely to eat them at a fast rate! They were fresh and tasted great. Would recommend to slim jim lovers!
"I thought that I might have had tried some of the tastiest oatmeal cookis before, but that wasn't so until I recently tried Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies . These cookies are so delicious. They taste just like homeade cookies. They are soft , full of raisins, and are just fabulous.I bought a box at my locl Walmart the other day for $2.18 for eight cookies. These are a good size cookie too. Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from Quaker I can't wait to try out the different varieties that Quaker carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks Quaker!! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box! They were A+++."
I get this at WHOLE FOODS for $4.59 per 32 oz. container. How can Amazon charge this price for 6?????
"I first sampled the taste of Jacob's coffee when a friend brought a bag back from Germany for me to try.  From that point on, I was hooked.  The coffee grounds aren't like most coffee grounds, as they're fine as flour.  Like German's chocolate being smooth tasting like silk, so, too, is the taste of their coffee.  No, the bags don't come with a scoop, so you have to experiment as to how much to add to your coffee filter.  But once you figure out how much to add to your filter, it's hard going back to anything else."
"I love this tea even though I can get all the ingredients from India and make my own masala chai. But this one has a special flavor and is organic! However, it is a little weak and does not give the full bodied tea experience of true Indian chai. So I mix strong black tea from India. Then boil some ginger before adding the tea in the water. Also, milk should always be added after the tea has boiled for a minute or so. When it all comes to the boil for the last time, add sugar/honey and strain. Boiling the tea without milk will give you more color and taste, otherwise it becomes too weak and milky."
The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
Excellent seasoning blend! Love it!!! I wish I would have bought two bottles. You can definitely tell it's organic. Braggs' products are great!
"I bring these everywhere for my gluten free daughter, and she loves them. I feel so good about giving these to her, because they are such a healthy snack; just organic brown rice and apple juice. And this isn't just a great snack for kids, but for everyone in the family. Mom & Dad love these too. I love how these rice cakes are just the right size. The bigger rice cakes you can buy were too big, and so messy. These are small and prefect to handle. No more huge messes. It's like your eating chips, but so healthy, shhhh! ;) Thank you HappyFamily."
I bought this as a gift after doing some quick comparison shopping and it seemed to be a good value. My brother was pleased with the wide variety of K-Cups and is looking forward to trying them all. I can't imagine that the included print adds value to the package though.
"I began purchasing Bromley's Estate Blend Tea at Reny's in Maine after Red Rose went 'flat' on my palate.  The Bromley is labeled ""Superior Blend of Fine Black Teas"".  Bags are swirl-through (similar to Lipton tea bags).  The flavor of the Bromley is reminiscent of what Red Rose used to be - robust, bright and slightly astringent.  I drink it black but I'm told it stands up to milk well.  Color is a pleasing reddish-brown.  My only complaint is that the bags are packaged for commercial trade (i.e., each bag is individually-wrapped).  Bottomline: It's a great value for the money.  Also available at Ocean State Job Lots.(Note: This review refers to Bromley's Estate Blend Tea which is caffinated.)"
"not as good as cheerio's but a lot cheaper. however, I will order cheerio's next time and buy these in bulk from the store."
"This has the same consistency as natural peanut butter, however, i found this very hard to swallow. It's very very chalky, takes time to get used to this. It had a lot of little specks, i assume this would have been A LOT better if the almonds were blanched..smoother and easier to swallow. So buyers beware, this is grinded up roasted almonds not blanched roasted almonds."
"It gives you a huge flavor burst of mesquite bbq, we use this on steak or chicken before cooking in our grill pan. We live in an apartments and can not have a bbq so this solves that ""want bbq flavor"" without having to resort to sugar laden bbq sauces."
"I've had this for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  If you don't want to spend the $, there are certainly cheaper ways to get the same end result -- fresh, healthy baby food.  However, I'm a working mom of two who is willing to spend some extra $ for convenience and for the assurance that I am not going to forget that I'm steaming veggies on the stove and leave it on so long that it ruins the organic food I just spent a bunch of money on!  The ease of use, from prep to clean up, is a big plus for me.  Plus, I make small batches, with different combinations every time, so my daughter is getting a better variety of foods on a weekly basis than when I made food for my son (I made large batches of food with the pot/steamer/blender combo for efficiency, and there was only so much room to store it, and only so much time to steam all of the different types of food).  I'm also more likely to make my own food on a consistent basis because of the convenience; in the couple of weeks I've had the Beaba, I've only reached for a jar one time in a pinch.  It takes up very little space as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is willing to pay a bit more for some added convenience and ease of use.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price tag, but I believe it's been worth it overall.  It seems like a quality product and seems well made.  If the price makes you cringe, just don't get it; you'll get by without it, for sure.  If not, and convenience is important to you, then I would recommend giving it a try."
"I can't say if I like it's formulation more or less than the bigelow and twinning's earl grey teas because it's so different that to me, I wouldn't have guessed it was 'earl grey' in a blind taste test (since I'm so used to the bigelow and twinnings formulations).  It's definitely a lot stronger than the other two in taste."
"My cat cannot get enough of this product.  She sits at the pantry and meows at the container!  The can in larger and full, but the product is flaky so it doesnt last long.  Better buy a couple of them."
"This is what you need if you want to make not good, not great but beyond amazing pizza dough. I've been making pizza for a decade and I thought I know what I was doing and what to use... and then, I tried this flour. Wow! Big deference: it has more elasticity to it so makes for easier tossing, and then the taste... poems should be written about the taste.<br />I've learned about Antimo Caputo ""00"" flour on Taylor's Ultimate episode - the ultimate pizza, it's where he goes to NYC, then to Italy, Naples and learns how to make pizza dough. The Italian woman who is teaching him shows him this flour and says that this is the only kind that pizzerias throughout Naples use. `Nuff said."
I really liked this coffee; my boss thought it a little strong because<br />he likes more medium smooth. Thus the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.
"This product tastes terrible and it also tastes NOTHING like actual coconut water. Anyone who has ever lived in a country where Coconuts actually grow would be and IS utterly offended by this product. It seems that people will buy anything that is prepackaged and overly process as long as it claims to be all natural. Save yourself and your bodies by not eating/drinking ""natural"" foods bought in a package. The truth of the matter is that anything that is actually authentic has not been processed in factories and put on a shelf."
Korean style ramen are often hard to find in stores.  Now the convenience of Amazon simplifies buying these delicious spicy noodles and soup.  These are one of my favorites.
"This product is no Dr. Pepper, but tastes close enough to make me happy with it. I will get it again."
"I love this Hot Cocoa.  It is the same that our local Bob Evans serves.  I used a single serve package of another brand just to see how much I should mix of the Bakers.  What I didn't expect to see was just how smooth the Bakers mix was compared to the ""other brand"".  And after my first cup at home, I'm hooked on Bakers Hot Cocoa. . .. and need to decide to whom do to give my ""other brand"" leftover packages!"
"This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.  If you are looking for an Earl Grey, this certainly is not it."
I like to take Jerquee on trips since it doesn't need refieration.  This is one of the more spicy flavors which I really like.  I bought an entire case for my last camping trip
"One package contains 5 thin layers of sesame crackers.  Little too sweet but sugar is NOT the first ingredient.  For Weight Watchers, each package is 4 points."
This is hard to find in store sometimes but tops the meatloaf off the best. Still looking for Big Johns beans though!
"I to was totally and utterly distraught by the open ended chocolate twists.<br />I thought ""How dare they turn my favorite Twizzlers candy into such an abomination!!!"" I would sneer and grumble at the open ended ones every time I passed them in the store.<br />It's nice that some big companies listen to their consumers, the classic closed end twists are the best, I hope they stop making the open ended ones completely."
Well my dog seems to like these very much.  Let's see if someone can offer free shipping on these.
"This is going to be short and sweet.  My little (10&13 lbs) dogs love it, easy to eat small bits, and it's a high grade food souce for them.  What more can I say."
"Why why why ruin this product with ""evaporated cane juice"" and palm oil -- among the most unhealthy oils -- pure saturated fat!  Almond butter, due to its monounsaturated fats and ldl cholesterol, can and should be a very nutritious substitute for peanut butter and even butter. That's why people buy it (aside from its amazing flavor)!  What are these people thinking?  So disappointing (and gross).  I don't know if I can give this stuff away."
"I first found this tea in a specialty store and paid over $15 for one container of it, so you get a good deal on here (since you get 2 containers). I enjoy this tea with a hint of sugar, but you could also add milk if you like. This is a black tea that has a hint of vanilla in it. It's my favorite tea by far (and I drink a lot of tea)."
My grandkids were with me in Maine when I offered them these candies. I keep them in my car so they all tried them!  They loved them so I ordered them all their own container.
"This is some of the worst coffee I have ever had.  The beans are very dry.  After grinding, the resulting grounds were a mixture of dust and dry flakes.  The taste of coffee was non existant.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00199557E"">Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Coffee, Louie Supremo, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>"
"While it's similar to most ramen noodle-type products, the seasoning packet seems more flavorful, and the 'top layer' (not sure what it is) is new to me, has a little crispiness."
"I'm happy to say that in this case a pretty package equals yummy popcorn. The freshness is just what you would hope to receive and it is easy to use. It's a little salty if you pour in the entire seasoning packet (I guess it is better to have too much than not enough).<br /><br />The popcorn has a slighly sweet taste with an acceptable amount of ""old maids"".  It is definately better than the popcorn I had before and I'd purchase this again.  Finally, this review is for the 4oz package."
"Basicly LOOKS like bread, has the texture of bread - but it is really difficult to get past the fact that it tastes terrible.  Even with the best condiments to mask over the flavor, it shines through tasting something like fish, the smell of windex, dust and sugar.  Honestly. I have made it 3 times now, wondering if it was just my technique, but no.  Sad - because the pancake baking mix is excellent, and I had my hopes up about the bread."
"There's not much to say here except that the dogs LOVE Beggin' Strips. They act very put out when we give them lesser treats (""Milk Bones""? They put their noses up at it). I don't see much difference between the with cheese and without cheese varieties and the dogs don't seem to care. This particular unit is two 25-ounce bags and we find that one bag lasts us approximately two to three weeks. We have two dogs and we give them treats, probably, two to four times a day depending on who's around. This is a cheaper way to get them than Wal-Mart."
"The Butler Lean Treats for Dogs are great for awarding your dog for good things they have done.  The are healthy and nutrishioust and I am so glad I found them for my beloved Italian Greyhound ""Windi""."
"I take these with me hiking and camping all the time. It gives me good energy without the nasty corn sryup. Very tasty, and clean whole food. Dates, Almonds, Apples, Walnuts, Raisins, and Cinnamon, whats not to like?. Toss 3-4 of these in my day pack, Along with a lunch and plenty of water, and I'm good for the day."
"I suggest ordering the pack with the small glass teapot with one each of 9 different flowering teas first.  Two disk and two balls are packed in each small box.  The ball ones open up in a cuter way.  They should steep longer to get the best flavor out of them but by that time, the tea will have cooled  considerably.  Of the four types, I only liked the taste of the ball with the red blossom.  None of them bloomed as prettily as other brands I have tried."
"I have a very energetic young dog who loves to chew but most bones and rawhides last no longer than 5 minutes.  This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.  If they are a very strong chewer then you should try products like this keeping in mind that it may not last very long."
"Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps go great with thick Dalmatian-style fig spread and some salty cheese.  Or jam one right into a scoop of your favorite quality ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a great price, and there is no substitute cookie for this flavor."
"I love this stuff. My DOG loves this stuff. I don't use it as a food but as a training aid. They are strong-smelling enough to be effective, I take the entire roll and cut the whole thing up into little cubes (about 1CM). I put a handfuls into seperate baggies, saving one to train immediately then freeze the rest. As soon as one baggie is empty, I move another bag from the freezer to the fridge to defrost. My dog is now trained but still gets these as a treat. Now we have a puppy and he is motivated to learn quickly with these!"
The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
These beans are very moist and the aroma is quite strong!  Nothing like what I've always bought in the stores.  I can't wait to make my next batch of Kahlua!
Shipping weight is listed as 6 pounds. Actual weight of product: 1 pound 4 ounces.<br /><br />It's probably obvious to someone who knows what size a #10 can (e.g. not someone not me) is that the weight of the product would not be six pounds.
My Boston Terrier just loves these. She gets one a day and she lets me know when it's time for one. So I always keep these on hand and Amazom is the best place and price out there so this is where we get them. I have ordered several 75 packs and will continue to do so. Great and way to go Amazon!!!
"I have been receiving Shock Hyper-Caffeinated Coffee through the subscription program of Amazon for over 6 months.  I love the fact that I don't have to remember to order--it just comes.  The coffee is very good.  It doesn't get bitter or taste ""funky"".  It says it is hyper-caffeinated; however, I don't get jittery or sleepless when I fix it.  I use the 1 tbsp/4 oz cup of coffee formula.  I drink about 1/2 pot and do not get an upset stomach.  Using this coffee, I don't feel like I need to drink an entire pot to stay alert through the morning."
"I ordered the pickled sausage because a friend told me how good they were, but I never received them.  UPS sent them back because the package got damaged and I had to request a refund.  So I have no idea if they were as good as my friend stated."
"excellent treat, my cats love them and they are low calorie.  Inexpensive if bought online, though expensive if bought at the Vet's office."
This coffee was not what I expected but enjoyed it greatly.  I was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it I enjoyed it a lot. It was light and smooth and left no aftertaste.  I would recommend this to others.
"A very good price on a hard to find item. Love the fact that it has no additives, preservatives. Its just straight up fish sauce and works well for cooking."
"I love the variety of flavors and fruit/veggie combinations HappyTot offers.  Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.  This flavor seems to be her favorite one though as she'll eat this one or ask me via 'sign' for this pouch more then the others.  With it being organic, all fruits and with great vitamins, I'm thrilled to have this readily available for her to enjoy."
"I'm a 20+ year user of Gayelord Hauser, All Natural Vegetable Broth with good reason.<br /><br />This stuff contains tons of Potassium which will rejuvenate you and keep you healthy.<br /><br />God bless the manufactures of this great vegetable broth.<br /><br />Makes the best soups out there and this is better than hot cocoa in the winter any day."
"Flavorful, mild curry. Rice is a little chewy, so I usually let it stew in it's cup an extra minute or two, or even shove it in a bowl and nuke it in the microwave for a minute at the end...and I often add extra vegetables, too. (Can you tell I eat this stuff at home, not at work?)"
"These lollipops are delicious. Both my husband and I and our kids like them. Much better than other lollipops that have artificial dyes, etc. in them."
"My wife will tell you that I am a tea snob.  This is an okay breakfast tea, but I'm not in love with it.  It's also not terribly expensive.  It is convenient.  I usually take it with some milk.  It tastes good with milk.  The tea is slightly bitter, not very flavorful, nor memorable.  I have tasted English Breakfast tea by Strand, Adagio, and a couple others.  Adagio's is my favorite.  This is good if you it's the only thing handy.  It's not bad, but it's not good, either.<br /><br />I noticed a few people thought this review unhelpful.  Sorry about that.  I can't recommend this tea.  Maybe you will like it.  If you do, don't go tasting other tea because you might realize how truly mediocre this one is."
"I'm not particularly health conscious, but when the general store on campus only had salt and vinegar (my favorite chip flavor) in the popchips brand, I figured I'd give these a try. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips."
These are great cookies and moist enough to feel like something other than a typical dry cookie.  They have a great mild ginger flavor nicely put together with the dates.  My only wish is that they would make it without sugar.  It's the only reason why I gave it a low rating and the only reason I won't reorder them.
"I have begun to use this tea after doing three natural gallbladder/liver cleanses and watching the stones come out like crazy when the doctors could not figure out why I had so much pain.  The cleanses have helped, but I am now two days in using the tea and have absolutely seen a rise in energy.  I am hoping this continues.  The tea tastes great with added mint leaves!  I am still looking for a tea that also has milk thistle without chicory."
"Well, better than Starbuck's K-cups.  And at a much better price.  The Tully's French Roast is by far the tastiest of the K-Cup French roasts."
"GREAT PRODUCT, LOVE TO WORK WITH GUM PASTE TO MAKE FLOWERS AND DESIGNS<br />IT IS ALSO EASY TO  ADD COLOR WHICH MAKE FOR PRETTIER DETAILED DESIGNS."
It tastes like it has an artificial sweetener or is sugar free. I wouldn't recommend it. But it will do in a pinch either by adding it to coffee or adding a flavored creamer.
"I switched to this product thinking I would get more of a value than buying the bagged form but I was wrong..It takes some time for this sugar to dissolve into what you are adding it to which was not a problem with the bagged xylitol..Not happy that I purchased so many packets but once they are all gone I won't be purchasing it again..Get the bagged loose xylitol, its much better..."
"My baby has had rice cereal for couple of weeks. then before starting her on this pear and garden greens, I let her have sweet potatoes so that her first memories of food are nice instead of ultra healthy greens. But she devoured this too. It is a good choice to be able to introduce greens so early. Just before feeding, I could smell ripe pear and sweet."
"Most protein drinks make me gag but the Click drinks taste great, and I think the Vanilla Latte flavor is not as cloyingly sweet as the Mocha. I still have to doctor it for flavor, as I find I have to do for all protein drinks, but that's me.<br /><br />I usually blend them with a small amount of NF milk, a big spoonful of NF yogurt, water, and a chunk - about 1/4-1/3 - of banana...fantastic taste, better than a Starbucks Frappuccino. But, darn, the high carbs :-( Carbs derail my weight loss and I can't ""spend"" that many carbs to get the amount of protein Click contains. If you don't care about the carb content, drink away. If you do, there is another great protein drink (no caffeine kick, which can be good or bad, though you can always make it with coffee): Great Protein at [...] low carbs, low sugars, high protein, and I can actually drink it."
"This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it ""worked"" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus."
"A colleague ordered this and his fire balls are smaller than mine. I'm not sure which size I prefer. They taste the same but the burn factor is a little different. His smaller ones don't seem as hot as my bigger ones. Oh well, they are still delicious!"
"My teenage kids like these more than I do.  I find them a little boring for some reason, but they love them."
"Whole wheat without a strong wheat-y taste.  Great texture and flavor.  Nice that it's organic too.  More expensive than the buck-a-box stuff at the supermarket, but worth it."
"I ordered a case & was dismayed that all the bags contained 70% broken pieces.  I bought these for my gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free son & for small children, broken food is a big deal.  I will pursue a refund from Amazon.<br /><br />Once you can get past the broken pieces, they taste good."
"Our 7 month old was exclusively breastfed until 6 months when we started slowly introducing solids.  Her food is about 50% homemade purees and 50% jarred/pouched baby food (Earth's Best, Happy Babies, and Plum Organics).  We tried sweet potato as her first food but it didn't go over well, so we decided to try something bland and smooth but didn't want to give her a processed white rice cereal.  We picked up the Happy Bellies oatmeal and it was a hit!  Now when introducing a new food I'll mix up a bit of the oatmeal and blend it with the fruit or veggie puree to help her adjust to the new flavor.<br /><br />Plum Organics has an oatmeal that also has probiotics and my parents have purchased it to keep at their house (we go for dinner once a week). I much prefer the packaging, texture, and ease of mixing/smoothness of the Happy Bellies oatmeal.  Happy Bellies also has DHA, which Plum Organics does not."
"I bought a box of Honey Stingers to use during and after hard running workouts. I have a general policy for foods: if I can't pronounce an ingredient, I won't eat it. Thus, I stick to whole foods, and avoid processed foods with fillers, starch, preservatives, and other garbage. For commercial energy gels, Honey Stingers are about the closest thing I could find. All good ingredients, other than the maltodextrin. But it's much more convenient than making my own gel.<br /><br />Oh, I love the taste too. It's a nice texture and consistency. I prefer it over Cliff Shot and Gu."
"Okay, I love this stuff; it's great to use in numerous dishes as a flavor enhancer. So, why am I writing this review? Because some people on this site like to rant and rave about a product technically having MSG. For the record and I have six different flavors of this product, there is no mention of this product being MSG free on any of the packaging. Okay? So, stop giving bad reviews to this product because you claim they advertise as MSG free. They do not do that, and you are spreading lies. You know who you are! Stop giving this product bad reviews for made up reasons. Read the label!"
Butterfinger hot chocolate is very good. It taste like a butterfinger candy bar. I like using it with my coffee for special treat. I get the satisfaction of the candy bar with a lot less calories and being warm/hot it is extremely comforting.
I want to try other types of coffee but I am so stuck on this one that it's hard to try anything else!  This is a mild roast.  Medium or dark roast is too strong for me these days.  The hazelnut flavor it very nice and every cup brewed is superb.  I have been drinking this Wolfgang Puck Hawaiian Hazelnut for at least 6 months and it never fails to please.  Give it a try :)
I love Jack Links Beef Steak and this has to top them all. I only ordered 1 box and will definately order more. I very highly recommend the peppered beef steak. A perfect blend of pepper and spices with a smoked flavor make this a great anytime snack.
"I actually like this product better than regular pretzels, which is good because I'm a celiac.  My sister, who lucky for her didn't get the celiac disease gene, will even steal some pretzels when I'm eating them.  If only all gluten free products were this good!"
"I have a young adult male yellow lab that I've had for about a year (a rescue), and he gets lots of exercise through playing ball many times each day. I recently switched him over from Blue Buffalo Wilderness grain-free, which he liked a lot, to this food, which he absolutely loves (I think even more than the Blue Buffalo). I was initially attracted to this one because it's grain-free and much more reasonably priced that BB, and the rave reviews and comparable nutritional values convinced me to try it, and I'm very glad I did. Making the transition was easy--I fed a mixture of both foods for about a week, going from mostly BB to mostly Hi-Tek, and he had no digestive issues whatsoever in making the change. His stools are a bit darker than before, but also more well-formed, so cleanup is very easy. And most importantly, he's truly thriving with this food--has tons of energy, excellent muscle tone, and beautiful coat condition. The fact that it's also much more affordable is a great bonus, too. In short, I would recommend this food unconditionally."
Do not purchase this particular flavor of coffee pod.  I thought my coffee maker was broken but actually the Small Village Blend of coffee came out very light requiring me to toss the entire box.
Love these red cherries. makes great fruit cake or as granish on cookies or inside your own cherrry cordials. The taste of paradise red cherries is excellent. My son likes to put them in sprite or 7 up.
"Not made in USA as stated. This is NOT made by ""Florida's Natural"", Amazon has the wrong information listed.  It is a knock off brand by a company called ""Florida's Natural GROWERS PRIDE"".  Bottom of can states:<br />""Product of ARGENTINA, made from concentrate""."
"This company is gouging you people!!  The product itself is fabulous, the best Chai Latte ever!  But I just bought 6 16-count boxes (what this actually is) from Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10.99 each.  Unfortunately it looks like they've stopped making this so the mark up is just going to get worse.  Shame on you."
"I already did a review on the coffe I purchased.  Coffee is good, expensive for not being a pound, and shipping is expensive too!"
"Love this product.  How can these be 1 pt on weight watchers for 3-4 cookies?  My plain shortbread list the following ingredients- wheat flour, butter, sugar, salt. I read the review claiming for this to have all sorts of additives.  What kind were they eating?  Is it flavored?"
"Our cat is a picky eater.  She refuses to eat pate-style canned food.  This does not leave us with many options.  Weruva and Tiki Cat both provide foods with shredded chicken meat and/or chunks of fish.  Kitty prefers the Tiki Cat chicken flavors to the Weruva chicken (which she often barfs), and the Weruva fish flavors to the Tiki Cat fish flavors.<br /><br />Our previous vet recommended incorporating wet food into her diet - she was getting chubby on dry food alone. However, our current vet noted that Tiki Cat is high in carbohydrates and fat."
"Despite the silly premise and acting, i can watch this fim over and over...not quite sure why....possibly because there are some good gore effects, gratuitous nudity (in the most ridiculous shower murder scene likely ever filmed) and a great climax. Clint Howard is actually pretty good as Stanley.<br /><br />This film is like a Troma-fied version of DePalma's Carrie."
"I love the flavor of Maranatha.  It has a distinct almond flavor.  If you are looking for a peanut butter like flavor, go with Barney Butter.  However I like the almond taste of Maranatha almond butter.  If you aren't sure, try it a small jar at your supermarket first.  I read reviews that it tasted rancid, which is not the case.  Although if you expect this one taste just like plain peanut butter, you will be disappointed."
"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money."
"The is a winner!  It's very convenient, and has all the taste you're looking for.  Somewhere in my magazine reviews, I read that this was the #1 choice for flavor.  I tried a couple other brands to decide for myself...I'm a believer...try it...you'll like it."
Wow!  What can I say?  I love the sour and crisp of the granny smith and I love chips.  This is like pure awesomeness having both thing I like into one - and it taste soooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooood!
"Good quality tea, and I like having a variety pack with the best flavors in one box. The price your pay on amazon.com is really great and beats supermarket by far."
"Tinkyada brown rice spirals are so tasty with both red and white sauces.  It is a more substantial noodle and sauce gets trapped in the spiral making dinner even better.  I love having so many gluten free pasta options.  Cook the pasta by a timer and you are not likely to over-cook as some others have done.  Truly an affordable substitution for ""regular"" pasta.  Thank you to amazon.com for carrying this brand at reasonable prices!"
"If I'm not looking for a full caff-kick out of my B60 brews, I usually put a teaspoonful of Quik powder into my cup after brewing, just to give it a hint of chocolate flavor (I was raised on the stuff, so go figure). After awhile I wondered if there was something out there that would give me the same taste without me having to dump the powder in. When I saw the Cafe Mochas at the local BB&B I couldn't resist buying a box.<br /><br />Ok, the good: Yummy, rich chocolate flavor (I never brew more than 8 oz., so I won't attest to the jumbo cup quantity); a welcome treat on cold days and/or nights.<br /><br />The bad: The coffee flavor is just barely there, if at all. It's almost imaginary, or maybe even psychological? A quick look into the K-cup will also show you that it's not even filtered---just straight up powder, really. It's only my discriminating chocolate buds that tell me that it's not simply hot cocoa. Well, maybe it is, but there's a little twist to it. So maybe that's the ""cafe"" part? =)<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a real Cafe Mocha, this isn't it. But I will give it 4 stars 'coz it's an enjoyable and tasty drink nevertheless."
"These wheat-free, egg-free treats are tasty. I have bought the espresso ones, but I have to say these are better. It has a lot of chocolate chips its soo yummy, but it isnt sickeningly sweet. Its good to have with a nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />The only thing is I would suggest is they should give 2 cookies instead of 3 by making the cookies a tiny bit thinner. Somehow 2 was a little unsatisfying, and the cookies were like too thick for my taste."
"I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either."
The 12 individually wrapped cookies came in good condition. This is a great tasting cookie and I like it toasted and not.
"These soy crisps are very filling and satisfying.  If you are looking for something with a great salty crunch, these are for you.<br /><br />They are high in fiber and protein, and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake.<br /><br />I think they are great and recommend them highly."
I am crazy about Splenda.  I mix equal parts Splenda And Brown sugar for my hot cerael.  It saves money and calories.  Asparteem  ( Nutrasweet)gives me loose bowels.  Splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories!
"bEEN LOOKING FORE A DECAF WITH SOME REAL COFFEE FLAVOR tHIS IS THE BEST<br />I HAVE HAD, AND I HAVE TRIED PLENTY tHE NAME CARABOU MADE ME HESITATE, VERY GOOD FLAVOR AND BODY<br />GOOD FROM AMAZON"
"This protein is great quality for the value(around 55bucks for 80 or so servings). Aside from that, the taste is great and it is easy to mix with a spoon and some cold water. I would definately buy this again."
"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month."
"This is a new tea for me. Both the taste and the aroma are superb if the drinker enjoys a spicy tea. While I'd tried other caffeine-free teas, including Twining's Unwind Chamomile Apple,  this is the first one that really does put me to sleep. I highly recommend it for that last cup of the day!"
This pasta stays al dente much more than other brands I have tried.  I am so impressed that I am going to make a point of looking for this particular brand from now on.  Bulk shopping clubs sell this for $7 per 9 boxes.
"Thats what you will be drinking if you get these tea bags....I order them twice and each time I could only use about 10 out of the 100! The bag that is holding the tea leaves is impossible to use. You can't even rate the benefits because you have to throw it out. Terrible, terrible bags. They break even in cold water...even when you are just holding one. Don't order, you will be sorry. It was too late for me to ship back but I would have. I didn't open them until late and I order again thinking it may have just been a bad batch...nope...the containers are cheaply made...what a ripe off."
"I love that this ghee is organic and grass-fed. I also love that it's rich and delicious, has a great shelf life (not that it lasts long in my house), and is easy to use. I'm off to melt a few spoonfuls onto some popcorn now!"
"Great seasoning.  I tried it on a whim, and then found I actually needed it, as my whole family loved the flavor it imparted to vegetables when sprinkled on lightly.  While I was out of it and trying to find it again, no one really liked the vegetables as much!!  Definitely a good addition to your culinary secrets!"
"I was not sure about the pepper factor with this product but decided to try it out.  The pepper seasoning was actually pretty good and a different twist on the usual cashew snack.  They went way overboard with the salt, however.  This really detracted from the overall quality.  If you are a big fan of very salty items, this is your snack.  If you normally prefer moderate, low, or no salt seasoning then you should pass on this one. ( Or build up some muscle mass by shake-shake-shaking the salt off as much as possible.  :)"
"I love this product and use it as a rice substitute. Also, I use it as a replacement for breadcrumbs in my recipes. Nothing wrong in using it as oatmeal either!!! This is a high protein, amino acid rich food (no, no one is paying me to say this). It is extremely clean and comes in a nice package that is recyclable or useful for other things."
"This stuff is the real deal all right, completely chock full of salt and about the same yellow color as a school bus. It's the stuff you get from a mac & cheese packet, and it's absolutely divine. I'm going to use it to make emergency soup, extra cheesy mac & cheese, popcorn, whatever I can think of as an excuse."
"I never buy flavored coffee.  I'm a cream, sugar and drizzle of caramel sauce type of coffee drinker.  When I read the reviews about this toffee flavored coffee I decided to try it with high hopes.<br /><br />As the coffee was brewing into the mug, I smelled a slight toffee scent.  It, and the coffee smelled good.  My hubs wanted a cup, just black.  I brought him his and after he drank some, while I was brewing mine, I asked him how he liked the flavor.  ""What flavor?"" he asked.  ""It tastes like coffee to me"" he said.  More questions to him and he said all he tasted was coffee, no flavor and the coffee was ok.<br /><br />Now for my cup.  I used about 1 inch of milk, one spoon of sugar and the Keurig on medium brewing setting.  The same faint scent of toffee was there along with the coffee.  I took my first sip and hardly tasted any toffee flavor.  I looked at the k-cup and it said 'toffee' on it so it was the correct k-cups that were sent.  It is such a mild, almost non-existent flavor that I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to those who don't like flavored coffee, I'm sure they would like it.  I'm disappointed in the weak flavor of toffee but the coffee itself is good tasting so it's not a waste.  I'm used to extra-bold, dark/french roasts so this is a much lighter roast for me.  All in all I like it."
"It may be a small packet, but it packs a powerful punch. I usually add a little extra water to make it not so strong."
"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it."
The taste of this product in my opinion is NASTY to say the least.<br /><br />Nestle's should bring back the recently discontinued (Milk Chocolate) flavor 50000 11164<br /><br />Nestle's you BLEW IT by dropping the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Not everyone likes coffee or hot chocolate that is so thick or taste like MUD!!!
A little hotter than I expected. A little bit for both the 'smokey' flavor and heat goes a long way!
"My husband, who is a two-cup-a-day coffee drinker, really likes this flavor. I highly recommend to those who enjoy flavored coffee."
I grew up in Germany and miss German chocolate even after 26 years. These were available all year long when I lived in Germany and have never been considered a holiday candy.<br />Amazon's price is still more expensive than having them shipped directly from Germany. Too bad.
I love trying out different spices and salts. This salt claims to have a sort of clay taste afterwards and it really does. The price was right and the size of the bag was good also. I sometimes just take a pinch and enjoy it.
"Come on, it's chef boyardee. I ordered these and I was very satisfied with them. Then again I've had them before, and these are cheaper than 10 for 10 at the grocery store. They are a quick fix meal solution if you're very short on time. Not the healthiest thing in the world but less sodium than most other canned chili's, etc."
"Wow was this one ever a surprise!  But, these Fancy Feast varieties have surprised me quite a bit over the past couple of months.  I've drug home more different varieties lately of these guys and this one, well, get out of the way for the stampede!  One actually ran into my leg, smacked it so hard that you could hear it upstairs! Now that's something!  Anyway, these foods are full of protein, vitamins and minerals and if you are particularly trying to rescue a cat, these do a fabulous job of getting them back to a full coat, full energy, and overall good health.  Highly recommend!"
"These are great. Low fat, low calorie, low in sodium and taste good. A perfect snack. What more can we ask for?"
"My cat went into mourning when our dog died and wouldn't eat, so my friend gave me a tin of this to try and that got her back on track. So, I ordered more and boy, did she love it. It even smells good, almost like human tin food!"
"I like Amy's products in general and these taste fine. although I like a heartier texture. At $2.27 per can (and that's on sale) I think the product is too expensive. It's so easy to make refried beans at home by frying and mashing a can of pinto beans and a can of kidney beans in a cast iron frying pan (use a little vegetable oil to fry then mash with a potato masher, adding bottled salsa to thin the mix and a pinch of cumin and chili powder for flavor). I'm all for encouraging sales of products made with organic ingredients, but beans are too basic to spend so much money on, imho."
"My pup enjoyed the flavor of the bone, bit its weird that it doesn't break down."
"This is a very good extract, and I needed a lot of it. The price was great and so was the service! Thanks."
These blue chips are great to dip salsa into.  It also can be eaten alone as a snack or as a side of chips to complement any meal.
"Lipton's Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags in Blackberry Vanilla make for a subtly sweet delicious cup of tea.  Tasters will see the pieces of real blackberries and hibicus flowers that enhance this beverage.  I'm not sure that the shape of the bag plays any specific role in making a better cup of tea.  It was good, not great."
"Firstly I should start off by saying that I can not get enough of these noodles. They are a bit pricey where I live but much better than any other instant noodle bowls out there including any Simply Asia flavor. The Korean Sweet Chili is the best and only flavor I love or even like in the Annie Chun line.<br /><br />I find that there is a trick to heating it up. Using a pretty small whole cup of water, microwave, let sit with water for a minute and then drain it out by just leaving one corner slightly barely open while the rest of the lid is tightly closed turn it carefully upside down and it should be able to easily drain the water out with very little to no ingredients pouring out and less chance of burning hands. I also keep the same mini cup around filed with 1/4 cup of water to gradually pour in after the sauce is put in if I was too impatient to let the noodles soak in the water for a minute after microwaving.<br /><br />Another great thing about this noodle bowl is that it is vegan, so I don't have to worry about fish oils being used!"
"When I'm in a hurry, I can always count on these potato products from Betty Crocker to make a hit without much of an effort on my part."
"As with all the Amazon subscribe and save items, it came on time and in good shape. It will take me awhile to use 24 cans, but I use chipotle in many ways and the cans will keep quite awhile. The peppers are a little hotter than the brand I usually buy. (We can't get this brand here.) I don't mind the heat. I just use a little less. The price is about 20% lower than I usually pay."
"The bar has almost no cashew but lots of dates. The bar should be labeled ""Almond Date Bar."" The label is misguided."
"Well, I have five of these gardens now, so obviously this is a product I've been very happy with.  I started out with tomatoes and salad greens, and the salad greens were so tasty I added a second garden of those and two strawberry gardens (the second one is on order).<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pumps or noise, and everything has grown beautifully.  With five gardens going at once, it's so bright in that area of my kitchen that it looks like a UFO landing site, LOL, but they are all scheduled to go off at 11 p.m. so it's no problem at night when we're sleeping.<br /><br />These gardens are so cheerful to have around.  They add a nice moisture and a green, fresh smell, and I find the lights cheerful too.<br /><br />The salad greens grow very quickly and are so tasty that my biggest problem is resisting the urge to constantly pluck off leaves and eat them all day long.  That's why I got a second one -- so there would be plenty.  With four in my family, one garden did not produce quite enough for us.  Our first salad crop also did not grow for very long, only a couple of months, but I think that's just the nature of the plant.  The tomatoes took a long time to go to the fruiting stage (13 weeks), but now they are producing two or three ripe tomatoes each day, and they are delicious.<br /><br />I love having food growing indoors.  No bugs, no bird poop, no dirt, and everything can be eaten right off the plant.  Tonight over dinner we literally watched our first strawberry turn from white to pink on the end.<br /><br />No, this is not a particularly economical way to grow food, but it's loads of fun and has been educational and exciting for my kids, who are much more interested in fresh produce than they used to be.<br /><br />I've had no trouble with either the pumps or the customer service.  In fact, everyone at Aerogrow has been very kind and helpful, both over the phone and in e-mail.  I hope the company continues to thrive because I just love these little gardens and hope to use them for years."
"The good:<br /> - Good taste;<br /> - Pops up plump;<br /> - Convenient.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> - Lots of unpopped kernels (far more than any other brand I've used). You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term ""natural and artificial color"" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No ""best by"" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you."
"I am allergic to wheat, soy, corn, and peanuts. I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all."
"I love mustard & have tried so many different types/brands and this is without a doubt my favorite mustard.  However, it is very spicy, so be fore-warned if you don't like spicy foods.  The taste of this mustard is so delicious that I put it on chicken & seafood before grilling or broiling.  I love this mustard so much that I am always on the lookout for recipes that will allow me to incorporate it. If you like very spicy and delicious mustard, then this is the mustard for you."
"I've been drinking this coffee DAILY for a long time and I never get tired of it.  It's got rich, full flavor, but doesn't have the acids and burnt taste that a lot of coffees get because everyone wants to make their coffee like Starbucks.  It's great value and it tastes like freshly brewed coffee every single time.<br /><br />I LOVE this coffee!  I drink the caffeinated version in the AM and the decaf in the PM.  Order and be overjoyed with coffee you can DRINK without the bitter and nasty mouth taste and acid stomach that other coffees bring.<br /><br />100% A+!"
I'VE been ordering this product for 5 years.its always great product and quick delivery.price also stays the same.i will continue to order this product.i don't remember if this item is available on subscribe program.if not i would like to.
"I just tried these for the first time and added in blueberries.  I found that the texture is tasty - somewhat like corn muffins - but the mix has very little sweetener in it, and didn't instruct to add any sweetening agent.  For that reason, I gave it 3 stars - b/c the taste isn't that great to me - but with some sugar, agave nectar or splenda, I think I would like these much better, and I'm going to try them again this weekend.  One other thing - I found that these do not form a rounded top like a ""normal"" muffin, for whatever that's worth.  When they bake, they do not flatten out on top or puff up, so if you wanted a more rounded top, you'll have to smooth them out in some way.  Still, I'm going to buy them again and try to modify to my taste."
"First of all, Chicken of the Sea's Pink Salmon tastes great and it is easy to use for a quick topping on a salad or at lunch.  The health benefits are strong as well with the omega 3 but also the entire packet is only 70 calories and is low in fat as well.<br /><br />This si a great on the go container and we would buy again."
"The product was easy to order, inexpensive, and arrived before the due date.  My cats just love these tuna flakes!!!"
"I can't get enough of these things.  Thank goodness they are in 100 calorie packs, or else I would have gained 20 pounds in the last few weeks! If you are watching your calorie intake, these are great to throw in your purse in case you need something to tide you over until you can find something healthy to eat.  I will purchase again!"
"Just to be clear- this is not authentic French onion soup.<br /><br />I've made the real thing- versions that require a few days and a lot of beef to make the stock, and those are delightful if one has the time and money and dedication.<br /><br />This kit is for when one does NOT have that time, money, and dedication. It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils.<br /><br />However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce).<br /><br />I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic ""croutons"",and my family liked it very much.<br /><br />Sauteed browned mushrooms would be an excellent addition, which I will do if I make this again!"
"Our 12 year old cat started losing her hair and then developed severe diarrhea and stopped using the litter box.  After trying different foods, vet tests and an antibiotic, this food solved the diarrhea problem within a couple of days.  It's now been 2 months and no more diarrhea issues.  We are still watching to see if it helps with the hair loss."
brought his basket as a gift to a frend in another state. I didn't see it but the recipient was very happy.
I live in a very hot and dry climate. SPORTea is the best thirst quencher I have ever tried.  Chock full vitamins.  Sweet and great tasting all without sugar or salt.  This is the first review I have written.  I am that impressed!
"Zico in the tetra pak is my favorite coconut water, and the passion fruit is my favorite flavor.  Coconut water isn't for everyone, it is a very faint, mild taste, but it is very pleasant and refreshing, especially during or right after a workout.  I have tried pretty much every flavor of every brand, and Zico in the tetra pak is the best, doesn't have the weird aftertaste that some of the other brands do.  I like mango and plain OK too, but the passion fruit is my favorite.  Coconut water is not for those who are used to strong, very sweet drinks, but if you're looking for a healthier, better tasting water this might be for you.  And though it's out of stock now, Zico says it will be back in distribution later in summer 2010.  I can't wait!"
"I just received my shipment of this product in the mail, and the packaging was horrible. Out of the 12 cans, four had huge dents in them, which, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, renders them unsafe for consumption: [...]. So basically, I bought this, and 1/3 of my order was unusable."
"I have bought more than six hundred of these at a discount store, and I have been eating them regularly.  It should be obvious that the only difference between the ramen flavors is the little flavor packets.  This flavor packet is a pretty zesty lime-citrus-salty flavor which is actually not as bad as you might think.  I usually use half the packet and throw in some curry and ginger, but that's just my preference.  Sometimes I will add a jalapeno or serano pepper that I sliced up into very thin pieces.<br /><br />So there must be many ways to enjoy ramen.  I only suggest that one watches the price.  I am happy to pay ten cents per packet at my discount store.  Otherwise it is seventeen cents at Walmart for chicken or beef flavor.  But even if the price is two bucks for twelve, it is still a great base for quick and easy meals."
"I have always liked Crunchie bars, and not being able to get them ""in the corner store"", okay, supermarket, in the USA was disappointing :(  These are fresh and the price isn't at all bad :)  I'm a happy, sugar fed, camper :)"
"This extract really works well. I used two tablespoons to make a half gallon of excellent eggnog flavored yoghurt. Most extracts (e.g., vanilla) do not work well for this application."
"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away."
This is the BEST wild rice blend on the market!  Comes out perfectly every time whether in a rice cooker or on the stove.  Delicious with all kinds of dishes from game to delicate fish--always easy to prepare and always great tasting!  Wonderful price for enough to keep on hand and store.
"I was reading how healthy chocolate is. They all said dark chocolate was the best. So since the active ingredient in chocolate is cocoa, I looked up good cocoa powder.<br /><br />This stuff is cost-efficient and healthy. I have two heaping tablespoons full every morning (mixed in with a glass of water). It reduces my morning caffeine intake because my brain turns on after my cocoa.<br /><br />They last for a long time. I bought two, and I've been working on my first one this whole time. If you're drinking pure, unsweetened cocoa mixed in with water, you may have to hold your nose the first couple of times. But then you get used to it, and you taste the chocolate.<br /><br />Recently my parents went to See's Candies and bought me a bar of chocolate. I was thankful, but I could have gone without it. I already am choco-satisfied with my cocoa powder.<br /><br />I'll be buying more of this when I run out. It's great for your health. Your brain, your heart, and more."
"My 10 month old has been eating this since he was 6 months- he loves to suck it out himself, no spoon or bowl needed! The flavors are so great that my 5 yr old eats them too. Extremely handy to have out and about or for a healthy snack anytime."
product was fine but it took 2 weeks to arrive-would not use this vender again
"All in all, this Folgers Lively Colombian coffee is a decent medium blend coffee.  It has a slight bite, but is highly drinkable and has no discernible aftertaste.<br /><br />For medium blend drinkers, if the price is right, it is a k-cup worth trying."
We are on the Ideal Protein diet and need dressings that have no calories. These fit the bill but are not edible. What a disappointment! Perhaps the other flavors are better but I thought that just about anyone could get Blu Cheese and Ranch dressing flavored right. Not so! They are awful.
"Definitely worth trying this one.  The Kiwi Lemonade is my favorite - just perfect.  Strawberry and black cherry lemonade varieties are both also excellent.  The Melon Lemonade is strangely appealing, though not as prized as the aforementioned.  The only one that disappointed me so far is the Ocean Blue, which really wasn't very good, IMO."
"I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is ""healthy"", and would argue against it being ""edible"".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks."
Packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box!
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52WME"">General Foods International Coffee, Cafe Francais French Style Coffee Drink Mix, New Great Taste, 8-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I like this coffee very much and it is hard to find in grocery stores in our part of Kansas"
"I don't know if it gave me any energy but it was a fine tasting, smooth tea. The vanilla and spice is a nice combination. I'm not sure about it being labeled ""perfect energy."" It doesn't contain near as much caffeine as a cup of coffee but that could be a good thing for a lot of people. Overall an enjoyable tea."
This coffee works great for Latte's. Here's how we make it:<br />- Pour 1/3 cup cold milk (Organic 2% works best) into ceramic mug<br />- Add sugar if required<br />- Microwave on high 45 secs (till milk starts to boil)<br />- Froth-up milk using a battery operated stirrer (we bought one real cheap at Ikea)<br />- Prepare K-cup on Medium Setting<br />- Pour over frothed milk & enjoy<br /><br />This recipe makes 2 cups of coffee for one K-cup !<br /><br />You can adjust the amount of milk depending on how strong you like the Latte.<br />Beats Sbucks any day.
"For a long time I thought I just didn't like coffee.  Turns out that I just don't like the stuff that my mom bought.  I don't know what she used to buy for the old coffee maker, but now she likes the Donut Shop K-Cups.  I can't stand that stuff without drowning it with vanilla creamer.  It's just too bitter.  The Nantucket Blend is a lot smoother.  Although the Dark Magic blend by Green Mountain is. . . interesting, of the coffees I've sampled, I prefer the Nantucket Blend."
"I ordered 2 bottles of TREE OF LIFE's 100% PURE BLACKSTRAP MOLASSES.  TREE OF LIFE is the best blackstrap molasses! The bottles arrived in perfect condition -- they were packed with great care! From Cyril Scott's inspiring little book (listed at Amazon) called ""BLACKSTRAP MOLASSES ~ THE NATURAL WONDER FOOD,"" I learned all about the many health benefits using blackstrap molasses in one's diet. Cyril Scott explained how to make a tea using blackstrap molasses mixed into a cup of warm water for a daily health tonic. ...My grandmother -- born in the late 1800's -- was aware of the health benefits of blackstrap molasses; she always had homemade molasses cookies in her home to serve her grandchildren and now, as a tradition, I also serve Molasses Cookies!"
"Best coffee I have ever had. After years of little or no coffee use, I delight in this new found taste."
"I dont like this at all. it taste like bad tea my mom used to make. and she makes bad tea.<br /><br />just my opinion.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />that makes me feel better though.<br /><br />i actually meat to get the green tea, but grabbed wrong one.  so take my review with a grain of salt as i dont drink arney palmy's<br />lol"
"Love this product in the morning.  It gives me great energy for the day. Grape is the best flavor, but I also like Berry.  Only problem is that it still contains small dose of sucralose."
Just as described and was great in my recipe for a nut cluster type cookie.
"My opinion is that this cereal is great.  It does need some sweetening, so I mix in a little of another cereal that's too sweet by itself.  I also use this cereal for added fiber, flavor, and texture when making bread. Plus it's more economical than buying the ingredients separately.  Highly recommend."
"I love the VIA instant coffees but at the store it is approximately $4.00 without tax for 3 individual packets, costing more than $1 a packet. However, I bought the 50 count item for $28.95 and it was eligible for the super saver free shipping. That put it at $.58 a packet! Such a steal! And this is the BEST instant coffee you will ever have!"
"Millet flour is great for my gluten free recipes (just remember the xanthan gum). This company takes a little while for shipping and the shipping is a little high, but, the products they sell are cheaper than anywhere else with a greater variety offered."
Lavazza has some of the smoothest expresso beans that I know. Not as harsh as Star Bucks expresso and makes a great Cappocino
"It tastes mildly of chocolate with the addition of stevia in it.  The problem though is the dental hygienist pointed out at my last cleaning that my teeth are getting unusually stained from something new I'm eating or drinking.  I mentioned purchasing a ton of this tea from Amazon and she was pretty sure that was the source since I don't normally have this issue.  As a result, I've mostly quit drinking it."
"My 3 Dobermans are in heaven!!!!  These bones are HUGE.  There is some smoked meat on them too.  Even my picky dog loves them.  I put the box down & went to the car to get some other stuff.  When I got back, she was ""unpacking"" the box.  They might seem expensive, but they are a bargain."
These K cups are wonderful! We were pleasantly surprised with the low acidity and smooth flavor! The Rodeo Drive K cups are on our top five K Cup list!
"Weak coffee, which was very disappointing compared to WP Reserve Blend (medium to dark roast).  Still a clean, non-bitter, no-aftertaste coffee.  But if you want a GREAT rich coffee with all of those qualities, go for the WP Reserve, which is truly the best coffee I've ever had."
"To be honest, although I've always enjoyed anything with Paul Newman's name on it and have always reordered things, this time I would not. I really like coffee. This reminded me of instant."
"I am a black licorice fanatic - have been since childhood. I've tried all kinds of licorice from all over the world, and RJ's Black Soft Natural Eating Licorice is by far the best tasting I've ever had. If you like black licorice, you will LOVE this stuff!"
"This has become my favorite Stash tea.  I liked the Earl Grey, but the Double Bergamot Earl Grey is twice as good!  As to whether or not it tastes like 'real' Earl Grey, who's to say?  They're all a little different.  But if you like Earl Grey, this is DEFINITELY worth a try."
"Looks nearly black in the middle of the popped kernel, but it isn't burnt at all. Corn-ey taste, we're really glad we've found this seller and popcorn."
"Wake up to a cup of Wolfgang Puck Coffe Breakfast in Bed (medium Roast) K-cup for Keurig. is a great way to start your day, or just sit down and relax. Try it and you will be buying more.<br /><br />Shop Amazon for Wolfgang Puck Coffee, Breakfast in Bed"
"Nothing spectacular, new or different in regards to this shampoo.  It lathered up nicely, rinsed cleanly, but I wasn't particularly crazy about the smell of it."
"Read the product claims.  Everything that is written is true.  As far as the taste goes---I add it to hot tea, then add ice to make it iced tea and it tastes as if I just added a little lemon in my tea.  Barely perceptible.  It is well worth the money.  All I can say is--give it a try.  It's not expensive and your health is worth all the money in the world."
These are the freshest and best tasting Neco's I have ever tested. They will surprise even the seasoned Neco expert.
"Hey, I really love this product! I just received the same message that they can't fulfill my order!!???? I have NO complaints about this product, and I expect it to be a bit messy in summer! (it is OIL!!!). Why is this product no longer available from the supplier? I am on auto ship so I can keep a consistent supply since I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Great product but questionable practice by Amazon to say the least."
After eating this kind of dry cereal all my life I was excited to try Ezekiel Cereal.  I remember it being in the Bible as a child.  When I first opened it I noticed it was very firm and granular.  However after a few minutes in milk it was ready to eat. I also tried it hot by placing a bowl with milk in the  microwave for 1 1/2 minutes.  It seemed to unlock the full flavor and was delicious. I now eat it this way. I shared some with a neighbor and they liked it and the Bible story that accompanied the box.
I got a bottle of this truffle oil for christmas and have so loved using it.  Particularly good in the winter months! Great on pastas and rice and my personal favorite is tossing popcorn with the truffle oil.  I also put it on roasted asparagus It's organic so you can trust it.  I keep mine in the fridge and it helps keep the truffle flavor strong.  PS  I just love the logo!
"Okay so I didn't expect anything spectacular but both my husband and I tried this and we were both a little dumbfounded. I don't really know how to explain it and all my husband had to say was it tasted ""soft"" We have filtered water and it there was a difference. This water is refreshing. Worth the price? Ummm, not in my opinion. I think we are an average household and there's no way we would afford to drink this on a regular basis. We do want to stress that we did like the water, but not for this price. I'll stick to my filtered/bottled water."
"Hi. I absolutely LOVE my Badia Complete. I've been trying to find it for 3 years. Anyway, my diet has changed since then, so I was a little sad to see that it contained MSG. (Monosodium Glutamate) Not a good thing. :( But it does have a wonderful flavor."
"Just so you know, you can usually get this at your local bodega or Mexican grocery store for less than half the price.  I'm like 1500 miles from Mexico and I can still find it locally."
"At last, a product by Crystal Light that does not use aspartame!! The taste is great, the box could hold more than 7-count, making it's space ineffective. Overall, a good product - I with Crystal Light would make all its products aspartame-free."
"I don't know why or how this one can taste so much better than Swiss Miss, but the Nestle fat free is my fave.  It also dissolves much better.  I hope Nestle never stops making this."
"My nine year old daughters love the rice and seaweed wraps. Microwave the rice and you're good to roll. They're vegetarians and recommend carrots, cukes, and radishes for their sushi rolls.<br /><br />This is good, convenient food, albeit pretty expensive for sushi rice and seaweed wraps. Still, the convenience is mighty nice."
"Nutiva is a company based out of Sebastopol.... California. Their hemp seed is excellent for stir fries, salads, and their 13 ounce pouches last awhile. I've used their hemp seed as a substitute for sesame seed in stir fries in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0836194942"">Simply in Season Expanded Edition (World Community Cookbook)</a>, as well as in the Mayan Wonder Bars and Rasta Pasta Primavera in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825305845"">Vegan Fusion World Cuisine: Extraordinary Recipes & Timeless Wisdom from the Celebrated Blossoming Lotus Restaurants</a>. It's versatile and has a subtle nutty flavor. They add extra protein. Nutritious and delicious!"
"I tried the Peanut Butter variety of Oreo Fudge Cremes, and they are definitely delicious- and RICH! When I first opened the pack, I was a little disappointed by what looked like a very meager number of cookies in the 11.3-ounce package.  The recommended serving size is 3 cookies.  Now, with a regular Oreo, I laugh at the regular serving size and proceed to obliterate an entire package in one or two sittings sometimes.  So I was ready to yell ""What a rip-off, Oreo!"" and be done with it.<br /><br />Then I tried a cookie.  I expected the fudge on the outside to be a little waxy and not very flavorful.  That's not the case with the Oreo Fudge Creme.  That fudge flavor was almost overpowering as I popped the whole cookie in my mouth - they're small enough to do that!  Then came the crunch of the thin Oreo, and the distinctive Oreo creme texture but VERY potent peanut butter flavor of the filling.  Imagine a piece of peanut butter creme pie with an Oreo crust exploding in your mouth, and that's close to the experience of these cookies.<br /><br />Back to my initial impression that Oreo's ripping us all off, putting so few of these cookies in a package.  People, it's a public service that they don't put more in.  At first I'd scoffed at the serving size, and while I had to try two of these cookies in pretty rapid succession (a conditioned response to an open package that says ""Oreo"" on it), I admit as I ate the third, I was slowed down considerably, more to a civilized three-bite per cookie pace.  That's when the richness and sugariness of the first two started hitting me.  I poured a glass of milk and enjoyed the rest of the third cookie, and had a fourth out of obligation to the remainder of my milk, and have decided that's the way to enjoy the Fudge Cremes- at least the Peanut Butter flavor- with a glass of milk.  I'd still rather have a package of original Oreo Cookies, or Double-Stufs, but I do like that the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes encourage drinking a glass of milk, and I do think that three of them is quite a generous serving if you're enjoying a glass of milk and taking the time to enjoy each bite, instead of wolfing down a handful.  They're a fun treat I think even Cookie Monster would approve of... in moderation."
No instructions on packaging that I could find. So first I put a pod into K cup machine. This is NOT for K cup machines. No taste. I do brew tea bags in same machine with great results.<br /><br />Then I put a pod in a cup and covered it with hot water and let steep quite a while.  Weak. Not my cup of coffee.
"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
Saves us a lot of money getting the refill packs than buying from the local store. we go through a lot of coffee and this is the only kind the boss likes so its a win-win.
"This is the best K-cup coffee I have found yet.  The Pike Place is a close second, but the Sumatra holds up well to a larger cup (either the mug or large mug size).  If you're using a travel mug, stick with the dark roasts.  Wish it came in decaf - I love my Keurig, but I can handle only so much caffeine!<br />Also, I have found the Starbucks K-cups disassemble easily (more so than some of the other brands), the foil removes very cleanly, you can compost the grounds and paper filter, and recycle the plastic."
"These were recommended by a cardiac rehab center to lower cholesterol.  I was skeptical but my total cholesterol had risen above 200 and I didn't want to take medicine.  Started taking the chews the end of Jan. 09 two per day for a couple months, then upped it to 4 per day for a month and a half.  Just had my blood tested and the total dropped from 231 to 172.  I exercise everyday same as before eating the ""chews"" and eat healthy but don't avoid ice cream or desserts.  I think these are the way to go and avoid the side effects of drugs."
"Chocolate caramel brownie coffee not only sounds yummy it lives up to its promise. The aroma is wonderful and the flavor is rich. The chocolate and caramel combo is perfect for that first cup in the morning, an afternoom pick me up, or an after dinner treat. I am a big fan of the chocolate coffees and this is one of the great ones. We bought the whole bean variety and will purchase again."
"My dogs think these Chicken Zuke's Minis are really tasty. The only problem for me is that the treats are so tiny, that my 90lb German Shepherd swallows them as if they're dust. They're excellent for a smaller dog, I just wish they were slightly larger for the bigger kids in the playground."
"I've enjoyed KIND bars for a long while and it's convenient to be able to order them through your site, though I can buy them at a lower price locally.  Can you do something about that?"
Surprisingly good.  Can taste the soy though.  A bit too much.  Cut back on that and you'll have a perfect product.
"I am a tea drinker so why not drink a tea that is good for you.  This tea is mild and slightly fragrant.  I am concerned however that this tea came in newer individual packets that look newer then the tea bag itself. I also thought that this tea was a little over priced, since I am able to go to an Asian market and get green tea cheaper."
"Great bargain , Amazons price is at least $10 cheaper the petco & petsmart .Our Jack Russell loves his nightly greenie.  I know we should be brushing his teeth but he turns into a Tasmanian devil every time we try. I like to think the greenies are the reason for his white teeth + he doesn't have doggie breath."
"I love the convenience of the single serve pouches and the honey/mango/pineapple flavor is good.  It isn't too sweet or artificial tasting.  However, one packet provides a fairly strong flavor so I prefer to use more water than is recommended, which just means that it is a better value than other drink mixes."
"If you love honey, you will really love this!!!! We love to eat it on toast. My wife eats it by the spoonful. Very glad we tried it. This will be one we continue to buy, and have on hand."
"For the size of the box, I was surprised that this only makes 2 very modest servings - we have to add a good amount of veggies and protein to make it a meal. The sauce does have a good flavor though, and the peanut satay version is rich enough to cover all of the ""add-ins"" with sauce too. Overall, not a good value, but tasty for packaged."
"We use dog food in here...but it all falls out of the hole pretty quickly! I'm not sure if there are certain kinds of treats that would work better in here, but it does not work as well as i thought it would. Although, when it is empty, my dog likes to play around with it. So I guess it entertains him and that's always good! (6 mo. old yellow lab)"
"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!"
My daughter wanted the wax bottles and the only place I could find them was at Amazon. My daughter really likes these so I'm glad was able to find them.
"I was using the ""raw diet"" for my little jack russell terrier and it was a pain to prepare.  I was willing to do it for my dog, but when others in the family wanted to feed her, they did not like to prepare it. I read the nutrition reviews of Blue Buffalo Wilderness and it sounded good for her.  I mix it with some of the dry and my little dog loves it and it is so easy to prepare.<br />I will continue using it...thanks!"
"I brought this pack of bottles after trying out the Torani vanilla flavor from my local grocer. They carried only 3 flavors and I just knew I'd get a caramel one off amazon.<br />Buying the bottles off of here is a massive savings. I brought a tiny bottle for the same price as one of these 25oz guys!<br /><br />Please don't think that this syrup tastes like caramel topping. It's CLEAR!! And it's meant to flavor drinks. That being said, I love this stuff! I make a large latte for myself a few times a week and put a shot of this stuff in there and it tastes better than local franchises!<br /><br />I love that it's all natural and it doesn't have too much sugar. I'm using this stuff instead of sugar to sweeten and flavor my lattes from now on."
"Its hard to describe taste especially since I'm not a connoisseur of chocolate but of the brands that I have tasted, this one sits in the middle for me, not of the highest taste pleasure sensation but a great deal better then others I've tried.  I love the Newman's Own Brand and every product I've tried from this brand has been excellent.  I think this one might be best used for baking rather than eating straight out of the package."
"I liked it with oatmeal, in a sandwich, etc. However, by itself, it is too sweet in my opinion. I wish there was a little more peanutty flavor coming out. There was a bit too much sugar, cinnamon, and raisons."
"I had used Krusteaz for years (had a ton from Costco), but wish I ran out of that sooner. This bread has so much more flavor and texture, as others have noted. Also, it almost always comes out right, whereas I had more failures with the Krusteaz for whatever reason."
It's nice to have an instant coffee product you can carry with you in the car or in a bag. Also hard to find an instant coffee beverage with creamer and sugar added. The directions say use 4 to 6 ounces of water. 6 ounces makes a week cup of coffee. If you like a mug of coffee you'll need 2 packs. This is Trader Joe's Brand and found out it's $4.50 cheaper per box if you actually go to Trader Joe's.
"This tastes nothing like lemonade.  It is awful.  It is inedible.  It doesn't even deserve one star.  I poured it down the drain.  The reviewers who said we're just not used to it are correct.  I'm not used to drinking sewer sludge, either, but that doesn't mean I need to become accustomed to it.  I drink nothing but diet drinks and I can think of a half dozen, some organic, that taste a million times better than this foul swill."
seattle is the best coffee. and the flavor cinnabon is great. anyone please try it.
Wish there had been more recipes on the bag.  I have been adding sweet potato flour to recipes substituting it for some of the regular flour.  Works well but I'd  really like a recipe for sweet potato pancakes.
"They don't look pretty (green!), they smell<br /><br />like any other hard cat food, but my fenicky cats<br /><br />cannot get enough of them.  Never thought they<br /><br />would eat these things, but they love them.<br /><br />Have not had enough time to see if it has actually helped any teeth, but I give it to them<br /><br />(6-8 each per day) as a treat at the end of the day.  They love them.....any flavor will do."
"My local grocery no longer carries this product so of course, I turned to Amazon.I don't know how good the other flavors are, but as an addict of cranberries....YUM! These are super crispy biscotti which is how I like the."
"LOVED this except for the added sugar.  People who order this are likely doing so to control fat or caloric intake, so why undermine their efforts?  If a sugar-free version, I'll order it again. Until then, I'm better off with the no-added-sugar varieties (as cutting out simple carbs has worked wonders for me for 10 years now).  A plus:  These make fabulous peanut butter cookies."
"I discovered these at Trader Joe's years ago.  Recently they stopped carrying and produce their own, which almost made me vomit and were returned.  Found these on Amazon.  It is a little pricey, so I eat less, but this company produces the best Teriayki Jerkey I've ever tasted.  The smaller packages always end up too dry, I only buy these larger ones."
"My wife & I enjoy this tea and really like the flavor.  We think it is better than other Moroccan Mint teas that we have tried.  Because it does have some caffeine, we drink it only in the morning or early afternoon."
"These dried mushrooms are called ""funghi porcini"" on the label, implying that they are of Italian origin. Nowhere in the product description is the country of origin listed, as it is with more scrupulous retailers. I took the chance and bought these based on the name, discovering later that these mushrooms are a product of China. Actually ""China/Yugoslavia"", which is even worse as it suggests not only questionable harvesting practices but that the mushrooms have been sitting around since the early 1990s."
"All of their Jerkies I have tried so far are very tasty, not too dry and not all soggy. Great flavor"
"We have 5 dogs and they absolutely love Nylabone Nutri Dent Filet Mignon. Indeed, in confirmation of ""Pavlov's Dog"" theory, they have even got the approximate time down for when they are to receive it, since they begin salivating and barking at me."
"I am a regular user of Necta Sweet and used to purchase it at Walgreens, CVS or Rite Aide.  All of those pharmacies stopped carrying it so I found this product through Amazon."
"I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being ""thick"".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Well, I am very disappointed!  They are not thick at all.  They are the same, ""slim jim"" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!"
"I love any good peanut butter cookie and thought this vendor, Nanas, looked to have pretty good reviews. But I'll tell ya... it's bland bland bland, tastes likes dried paste, horrible. There's a list of ingredients on each package of the stuff they 'don't' put in there like eggs, sugar, etc. Well maybe they should realize that those ingredients are 'what' makes a good cookie. I won't try anything from them again."
"I really want to like this cereal. It reminds me of the hot mush my grandma used to make which was a mixture of oatmeal, cream of wheat, and wheatena. The texture is excellent, not at all gluey like pure oatmeal. Mixed with maple syrup and yogurt I was very very pleased.<br /><br />However there is one problem you need to know. This cereal has a slight bitter aftertaste when you don't add anything to it or mix it with anything. I am not quite sure what it is due to, and I can't taste the bitterness if I mix it with a good amount of honey, or brown sugar, or butter or maple syrup. However if you like to eat your cereal without any sweetening added at all then I think it is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />I think if you mix this hot cereal with other cereals it will improve their texture and you probably wont notice the aftertaste."
"The mix came complete.  I just thought the finish product would be a little more sour, but I liked the product."
"I recently ran low on Castor & Pollux Organix Adult Less Active Canine Formula Dry Dog Food and it was unavailable with Prime shipping at the time, so I ordered this brand.  I've been mixing the two together to increase my dog's acceptance, but she now has not eaten for three days straight.  I suppose that is an alternate strategy for weight reduction, but neither of us is happy, and the food was really expensive.  My dog does not recommend this dog food. She preferred the Organix."
"Mrs. JS says:<br /><br />I have two main requirements for shampoo: lather well, and leave my hair clean with no residue. I also always hope for a shampoo that will calm my somewhat-frizzy curls into softness.<br /><br />While this shampoo was outstanding for the lather (really does a nice job there), it did leave a perceptible residue buildup in my hair after a few shampoos. (I do not use a conditioner.) I also didn't notice any impact on making my hair more manageable or softer looking, sadly.<br /><br />It has a coconut-y smell (maybe that's the shea?), and it does leave my skin nice and soft (I tend to use shampoo as a body wash as well), but since that's not enough I won't be running out to buy more.<br /><br />While Mr. JS says: as a guy, I review from a solid position of ignorant indifference. I say this shampoo feels good and makes nice lather. On second and third day not so much squeekiness from my hair; is that a residue thing? Maybe that's the ""nourish"" part. But it smells nice."
"This sauce is hot but no where near as hot as Chodruff talks about in his review. That was merely good storytelling rather than a truthful review of this sauce. The sauce has a very pleasant fruity tasty but not from any additives but rather from the natural taste of the ghost chili the main ingredient (although it has an odd smell like sweaty socks). Its no where near as hot as Dave's original insanity sauce. I can eat it a drop or two at a time on a corn chip or in a taco and the burn is moderate to hot but not crazy hot, whereas Dave's original insanity sauce would make a whole pot of chili burn with just a drop or two. This is one of my favorite sauces now. I bought a bottle a month ago and it is about 1/3 gone whereas Daves insanity lasted me years ( unless my tolerance is just growing ;-) ) Enjoy!!!"
"I have been searching for a rich robust French Roast Decaffinated coffee forever! Now that I can make delicious fresh coffee every time because of the K Cups, I am in heaven!<br />I have devoured more coffee since Green Mountain's Tully FRENCH roast decaf in the last few months then I ever drank in all my life. That is saying a lot for a 76 year old!"
These hemp seeds are a great value.  I have searched around and these are at an excellent price here.  They add a nutty flavor to salads and I also use them in smoothies and even make hemp milk with them.
"When I was little, my great aunt had been traveling somewhere (can't remember where), and someone gave her a tin of violet mints.  I'm not sure if these are the same brand, but she offered me a few and I've always remembered them. They did come in a little tin and they were round and smooth, as these are.<br /><br />The taste is slightly violet and a little sweet.  In the middle there is a very tiny bit of licorice. It takes a while to get there though. Unless you have teeth like rocks, do not crunch down on these. You have to be patient.<br /><br />I'm glad I found them."
"I've been using this sauce almost daily for more about 15 years. Not once have I wondered if someday I'd get tired of it. The sauce isn't really ""hot,"" but is loaded with flavor and has a snappy tang. The complex mix includes raisins, mangoes, and some sugar for sweetness, peppers, onions, and cane vinegar for some bite, and thyme and cloves for subtle spicing. It's wonderful on meat, fish, fowl, and is great for marinade and more elaborate sauces. Made in Jamaica!"
"I eat a low-carb lifestyle and in the beginning, I missed my cereal. I found this and think it's delicious!  It has a consistency of grits more than regular oatmeal, but it is very filling and yummy. I usually add Stevia or my FAVORITE added ingredient is Walden Farms sugar-free, calorie-free Apple Butter. It's to die for!! I am definitely going to keep eating this product!"
"I really like these French Roast k-cups.  I was concerned having read other reviews and ordered the Fog Lifter first (which I like as well but it is not as strong).  I ordered 80 k-cups which is a great value.  I have no issues with the ""cupless"" k-cup. I also do not find the flavor ""burnt"" or ""bitter"" which I read in other reviews.  I find it to be a full bodied bold coffee.  It works great in my Keurig and the coffee strength is perfect.  Flavor is robust and I look forward to having a cup.  I would recommend this coffee to others who enjoy the French Roast bold coffees."
"Taylors of Harrogate's Scottish Breakfast Tea isn't just for breakfast! It's great with meals,  snacks, and great hot or iced. It is a very hearty tea, with a robust blend of flavors that go well with a wide variety of foods.<br />Scottish Breakfast Tea seems to pack a pretty good caffeine punch for me. I like the no-tag teabags that brew more than one 6-oz. cup, too. I can generally brew a gallon pitcher of iced tea on 6 bags, and I like my iced tea as dark as strong coffee.<br />I started ordering Scottish Breakfast Tea from Amazon when our local stores stopped carrying it. Amazon's prices are better anyway, and you can't beat their shipping time. I have my new favorite tea ready all the time now.<br />Thanks, Taylors of Harrogate! Thanks, Amazon!"
"I have a hard time believing Benriach 15 Dark Rum cask finished single malt whiskey is really aged 15 years. It's tow-headed pale yellow: among the lightest colored whiskey's I've ever seen. The aroma is nice - marshmallow, cake batter and butterscotch. With extended time a clear pineapple note comes to dominate the aroma. The pineapple and butterscotch aroma (pineapple upside down cake?) is yummy. On the tongue it is filigreed and lacy. Cerial honey, cake batter up front. There are some fruit esters at midpalate (apricot and sugar cane) and distant wood notes at the finish which is moderately short. My issue here is that there is too little oomph. What flavor there is here is nice - but there's a bit too little for my taste. Looking, smelling, and drinking this I would guess it has 8 years in the wood - not 15."
"It wasn't the best thing i've ever eaten, but it wasn't the worst either. I did warm it up before I ate it, and it just tasted like warm granola. The banana nut flavor isn't as strong as I'd have liked."
"I LOVE pop chips!  I like salty snacks and having one this low calorie is great.  I did think that the single serve bags of salt and vinegar has less flavor than the bigger bags, so I think next time I buy in bulk I'll get the bigger bags."
"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
"The pill pockets are great for dogs who will not take pills!  Otherwise I'd just use cheese, peanut butter or hot dog pieces.  Unfortunately one of my dogs is too smart for any of those.  It's a little pricey but worth it."
"It tastes great to me. I love blueberries and pomegrantes so what's not to like. I only use a fourth of a packet per 8oz. glass of water. I rather drink this tea than the sugery cola I usually drink for an energy boost to do housework with arthritis. If you are expecting it to taste like juice, you will be disappointed. It is NOT meant to taste like juice. It taste like tea with a mild infusion of fruit."
"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"
I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup
"I LOVE dry soda but Vanilla is not our favorite. I think something about the vanilla needs to be sweeter. Like more a cream soda thing. BUT do NOT let me discourage you, you may LOVE it. I only like it."
This creamer is very heavy on the cinnamon flavor and light on vanilla. I was very disappointed and now am stuck with 4 boxes of it.
"I prefer my coffee black.  Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the ""Americano"" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy ""Americano"" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me."
"I have replaced candy bars with the Kind Bars, and they are better.  My favorite are Nut Delight.  The ones with chocolate are my least favorite."
"I've been eating these or their milk chocolate version almost daily for the last 8 months, and as of yesterday, I've lost 50 pounds.  They are GOOD. Really GOOD. I let the pieces melt in my mouth to savor them.  Just remember that they have maltitol in them, so don't eat more than one daily, or you'll definitely have some ""digestive distress"" to say the least."
"I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach."
"When I first opened the box I was surprised to find 5 packages of granola bars, each with 2 bars each, so a ""10-pack"" has 5 packages with 2 granola bars in each package (I never noticed it was normal to do that with granola bars), hence the serving size is 2 bars. The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me. You get about 60% more mass with a clif bar than with this for the same price.<br /><br />That being said, they taste decent and taste good broken into pieces with peanut butter and nutella."
"I've enjoyed this tea for years.  It used to only be available from it's source, the spice market at Pike Place Market in Seattle.  I used to run out and have to wait until my next trip to Seattle.  Now, with it available through Amazon.com, I can save the travel expense and have it delivered to my door!<br /><br />It's a great spiced tea for hot or iced tea."
It is good and soothing to drink. I have not tried it too many times yet. I am sharing with my sister.
"ok, I admit, I do buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, usually because of great price and quick shipment... But I got caught with this item... I ordered it along with other baking goods and the next day I saw it in Stop&Shop for $0.98! So obviously I bought it and thought I would just send this one back (4.79 is just a ridiculous price)... But this is not that easy. If I want to return it, I have to pay for shipment - which is another $5.00 or so..."
"This is simply the best energy shot you can buy, and I think I've tried about 50 different kinds. It's just the right amount of energy, and just enough caffeine to work well even if you're quite tolerant to caffeine. As a fair warning, the vitamins will make your pee turn neon yellow regardless of how much you've had to drink that day."
"After trying these from the airline, I am addicted.  They smell like baked blueberries and taste like crunchy blueberry muffins!"
"I couldn't be more satisfied with this product. It is highly nutritious, where it basically provides all the needed amino acids which the body needs. There is much information available on the hemp seeds and here are some which I came across which turned me to start enjoying this super-food:<br /><br />http://www.ratical.org/renewables/hempseed1.html<br />http://www.drbronner.com/pdf/hempnutrition.pdf<br />http://sudburymarket.com/nutritional_benefits_hemp.html"
Could do with a touch of sweetness as the salt is far too over powering and it seems over dried. I bought a box and can't get rid of the rest
"I quite liked it, the flavor is a bit harsh at first but then it becomes more mellow. It is most certainly caffeinated which is good. It is too expensive to buy more than once though. All in all I liked it."
Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again
"I ordered this product because of the Dr Oz show for anti-aging, a nice by product is I swear my knee pain has improved since I started drinking a cup a day, oh yeah and it taste good."
"I love this tea - it tastes just EXACTLY like old fashioned black tea; BUT IT ISN'T!  This is a healthy, caffiene free, herbal tea that doesn't keep me awake, doesn't give me acid stomach, but gives me real taste satisfaction.  This tea is just right!"
"WOW! This product is simply delicious. Nice texture, almost like shredded beef(better than beef jerky in my opinion) and the spices for this flavor is just right! A combination of smokey, salty and sweet. The only problem I have with it is trying to stop eating it! I know it is packed with protein, low in fat and only 81 calories, but the carb content (11 grams per serving)seems pretty high for just one strip. Just have to watch my consumption :oD Although, I have replaced a meal with two primal strips and lost about 5 pounds this week. All in all, this is an exceptional meat alternative snack."
I've tried all the different flavors of bars that Fiber One offers and these are definitely my favorite. The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!
"Nothing at all against this, or any other seller selling this item. I very much enjoyed my DIY ""spiked"" drinks. However, if you purchase straight from the manufacturing company, this kit is nearly $8 less shipped (dependent on location of course.)<br /><br />Again, I really do like the product and had a great experience with this seller, just thought I'd throw this out there."
I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
"I received my bag of Kind Healthy Grains clusters free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />We eat cereal for breakfast a couple of times per week, and I'm always looking for one the kids like that isn't half sugar and artificial colors. I was really impressed with the ingredients in this product -  Non-GMO flax seeds, amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  No artificial ingredients, preservatives or coloring, and it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice and molasses, and not the dreaded HFCS.  It's high in anti-oxidants, Omega-3s, and fiber, and is low in salt and fat. Best of all, it contains actual blueberry puree - very few of the foods sold as ""blueberry"" actually have any in it!<br /><br />Overall it's a very good choice for snacking or as cereal.  They need to put it in a box or some other container because my bag arrived with all the clusters broken into small pieces.  There was no way to eat this except as cereal with milk, or sprinkled on food (we had some on yogurt).  It tastes really good, with complex flavors from the various grains.  The kids like it, too."
"I first tried this incredible sauce at the NOODLES INC restaurant with a udon noodles type of dish with chicken breast and cilantro and bean sprouts. OMG !! this sauce is unique, sweet, perky and garlicky and this fresh kind of hotness you wont believe. I immediately went to King Soopers and bought the noodles, sprouts , cilantro and chicken and the Sauce to make this at home. YUMMMM !!"
"Marshmallows are my passion.  I love them so much.  I can eat them plain, in cereal, in coffee, in Rice Krispie treats, any way.  My favorite way to use these marshmallows is to drop two of them into the bottom of my cappuccino cup and pour in steaming espresso and steamed milk.  The marshmallows give the coffee drink just the right amount of pumpkin spice flavor.  I wish these were available all year round as I love anything pumpkin.  The flavor is the perfect amount of Pumpkin and Spice and not overly sweet.  I still have a bag left, but wish I would have ordered three times the amount.<br /><br />For Halloween, I made Pumpkin Spice Rice Krispie Treats and not only were they pretty, they were delicious.  My friends and their kids went crazy over these treats.  At Thanksgiving, I made a Yam Casserole and instead of using regular plain white marshmallows, I used the Pumpkin Spice marshmallows.  They were a real hit.<br /><br />If you like Pumpkin and you like marshmallows, get these; you will not regret it at all.  I could sit and eat the whole bag plain."
My two dogs love this; they bark while I'm getting it ready and then woof it down! It looks good and smells good too.
"I was lucky to have ordered chips on a Virgin America flight and was so excited to see them on Amazon!  They are light and crispy and they do not have MSG or anything bad in them.  They only have about 100 calories per bag and around 3 grams of fat.  I love them!  If you are a chip lover, try them!"
"Both of my dogs love these treats! My border collie has been having problems with stiffness in her back legs so I thought I would give these a try. I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on ""Subscribe and Save"" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie. No hip/lep problems there but maybe we can head em off at the pass!! They LOVE how they taste and both sit patiently waiting for their treat!!! Thank you Zuke's!!!!"
"If you like spice, you will like Siracha! This bulk set is awesome. We use a lot of this stuff at my house."
Good price for the size I wanted and great quality.  It was just what I needed for a mead project.  Items was delivered quickly.
"I have purchased chicken chips in the past and they were not from China.  Shortly after purchasing this order my dog became sick.  I cannot say it was from this order of chicken chips but he got sick shortly after I started feeding him this order of chicken chips.  I had to pay a $500 vet bill when my dog had blood in his urine.  The vet could not determine what caused the urinary tract infection.  My sister told me to check the container to see if the product came from China, it did.  She gave me a different bag of the same product that was made in the USA. Check your packaging."
"My kids and family are addicted to runts this has been the fastest and best amount for the price I have gotten so far. Plus I got tons of bananas ""yum my fav"" getting ready to order more."
I WAS SERIOUSLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS PROTEIN POWDER.  IT TRUELY IS GOOD HOT OR COLD.  PERFECT BREAKFAST IF YOU JUST LIKE A PROTEIN SHAKE FOR BREAKFAST AND YOU LOVE COFFEE!  WHY NOT COMBINE THE TWO WITH A DELICIOUS MOCHA FLAVOR!  THIS IS A NEW FAVORITE OF MINE. I LOVE IT!
"I have eaten the Miracle Noodles angel hair variety, prepared several ways, and could not tolerate the texture.  The Tofu Shirataki Noodles fettuccine has a much better texture.  The best use I have found is in Asian type soups, let the Tofu Shirataki noodles simmer a little while in the soup broth and they taste good. I do not like these noodles cooked in Italian recipes. Overall, the Tofu Shirataki noodles are an acceptable substitute for authentic pasta since I'm trying to lose weight."
This is the best of all hoisin sauce brands. Learned about it in my Chinese cooking classes.
I bought this as it came in a pack with the mascara and as it turned out I liked it more than the mascara. It is great stuff. It smells to me like baking cookies. Every time I put it on my husband asks me if I am baking something. It has such a yummy smell. It is so smooth and goes on great. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a good face cream.
"The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's ""Glutenfree Recipe Collection"" magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick, it's easy, it tastes good, and it is versatile.  And hey- although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh!"
"So I order my favorite Jim Beam seeds from Amazon every couple of months. I was running low so I decided to order a new case this week. To my dismay, the package that came in the mail has changed. The picture on Amazon still shows my favorite brand, but apparently Jim Beam seeds are now being produced by ""BIGS"". They changed the seed, as well as the amount of seasoning. The taste is the same, but not nearly as strong.<br /><br />Just a shame. The genuine original seeds were perfect. It wasn't just the taste, but the amount of flavor, as well as the quality of the seeds. Now we just have something simliar to a regular store-bought brand.<br /><br />I contacted Jim Beam and they verified they no longer have genuine seeds. They are all BIGS now, so my seed buying days on Amazon are over. I might as well go back to Davids or some generic brand from the grocery store."
"These are really cute candies. Each drop is wrapped into hundred of crunchy round bits, just like a real berry. Oozing with flavor and enticing aroma. The gummi part is found inside. Although the Haribo bears are my ultimate favorite, I find this one a bit too sweet for the taste."
Just the right amount of flavor and saltiness.<br /><br />Makes wonderful miso with perfectly suspended clouds throughout the soup.<br /><br />No problems with shipping.
"This is a 5 flavor assortment, not the 10 flavor assortment. If your looking for the 10 flavor assortment as I was, DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! False advertising..."
"This will give you exactly what you want out of an instant Miso soup.<br /><br />You get six pouches with 3 servings in each, it is a paste so it is very compact and travel-friendly. I use a bit more than the suggested 8oz of water and it is simply delicious. I eat it as my lunch at work and it is surprisingly filling, very satisfying. This is the first subscribe and save purchase though Amazon that I have made that is actually worth getting at regular intervals, I may have to order more before the month is up."
"We have been working with our dog on crate training and this was an amazing treat which he loves!  It takes him a while to get through these and when you get to the last few inches, you can stick it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it puffs up into a crunchy treat."
"WHENEVER I BUY THE SMOKEHOUSE CHICKEN BREAST, JAKE(BOXER/ROTTWEILER--127#'S--10 YRS YOUNG) HE SEEMS TO KNOW WHEN THEY ARRIVE AND WILL NOT SIT STILL UNTIL HE HAS HAD HIS FIRST TREAT.  WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OR HE WILL EAT UNTIL THEY ARE ALL GONE."
"We are always searching for milk alternatives, as one of my sons can not digest caesin. This was a nice product that presented itself as chocolate milk...it wasn't too chalky tasting. The texture was somewhat similar to milk....he liked the product but I wouldn't say he LOVED it...."
"...But these are pretty good! I generally steer clear of Oatmeal and Nuts in my Cookies (Give me a good old Chocolate Chip Cookie any day!), but these have a very nice Chocolate Chip taste, the Oatmeal taste is there, but it's not overpowering, and the Almonds didn't bother me very much. My only real complaint is in the packaging: The large box only contains 6 moderately-sized Cookies, which are individually-wrapped. The individual wrapping is good if you want to take a Cookie or two on the road with you, but when I saw the box my first thought was ""With a box that size, I'd expect more than six Cookies."""
PURCHASED AT AMAZON VERY BAD PRODUCT! TASTE LIKE VINAGAR WATER.DURKEE BUTTER FLAVORING.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.VERY SORRY I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.CAN'T BELEIVE DURKEE PUT THEIR NAME ON THIS PRODUCT.
"Mom and dad have been making mustard from Colman's fer decades! One key ingredient when mixing, if you care fer it, is whiskey. Yes, whiskey. You won't get drunk, but yer sinuses will clear immediately. lol The taste is great, as it always has been. I hope to find out the rest of the recipe from my mom soon, but she likes to go by taste. I hope she isn't drinking, she's 83 years old now.  lol Enjoy the mustard....when possible, I hope to get some soon.  I still have 3 cans left!  :)"
"If you like the taste of water with a hint of coffee, buy this. Otherwise stick with Starbucks VIA.<br />I use the instant coffee mid-way through my day at work. The Taster's Choice requires 3 packs to make a decent 16oz cup of coffee. The Starbucks VIA only needs 1. Spend the extra couple of dollars on the Starbucks if you want good instant coffee."
"When I first tried this product I loved it and used it in my baking (I run a small online bakery) and would have given it 5 stars for sure. Now in less than a month they've hiked the price up from just under $6 per package to $8.99, and no long offer Super Saver Shipping, and charge nearly another $8 for shipping? Save your money. This is just ridiculous."
"If you like coffee but can not stop to get some these coffee flavored candies are just right, a bit hard to unwrap but hits the spot."
"My husband wanted some honey with the comb in it. The morning after we recieved it, he made bisquits and we drizzled this honey over them, this is the best tasting honey. Delightful."
Perfect for last minute food ideas because you just picked your veggies from your garden. Wonderful product.
"This blend is one of Starbucks' gentler blends, but you have to like the taste of Starbucks to appreciate it.  Often described as having a burnt taste, Starbucks beans are known for their strongly roasted taste.  Maxwell House afficionados should steer clear.<p>Before you invest in Starbucks coffee, make sure you like the flavor by tasting the brew at a local franchise.  If you don't have one near you, make sure you like a strong coffee flavor.  Although I enjoy Starbucks coffee myself, I am leery of recommending it to the uninitiated.  If you like the taste, stock up now.  The coffee stores well for months in the freezer."
I absolutely love licorice and I love this tea. I have a glass nearly every night in the winter. It tastes great and settles your stomach.  Highly recommend.
"To be fair, I think I'd give any of these miniature packets of ""healthy"" ""water boosters"" a two-star review. They're just not all that tasty, and all have a nasty aftertaste from the artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This product almost earned itself a one-star review because in addition to the aftertaste, there are little crumbly bits in it that just aren't a pleasant thing to encounter in a beverage. It was a rather nasty experience overall, really, but it saved itself from one star because the actual fruit and green tea flavours were really quite nice."
My son takes a snack everyday and he loves the Kind Protein Bars.  They arrived very fast and a great deal!
Out of all the Stage 2 foods this one is not runny and very yummy! My little one loves it.
"The Red Caviar is very fresh and melts in my mouth in the way it is suposed to do.  I don't know how they can improve the packing, the can came all slime.<br /><br />It was send well packed (refrigeration) and it came on a timely manner."
"Wow is this better then finger licking good ! It's laying in bed dreaming about the piece left in the fridge, and getting up to the nightmare that someone else ate it, GOOD! I need to buy stock in this winner ! GOD BLESS SYLVIA !! weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
"These are actually pretty good little potato puffs, and best of all - no CHEESE!  (unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).<br /><br />Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10."
"Cons:<br />1. Neither of my children liked the taste. They loved Earth's Best, even the vegetables.<br />2. It is not as convenient as the Earth's Best when travelling since you have to carry a spare container to serve this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. BPA free packaging<br />2. Organic and preservative free.<br /><br />The lining of the lids in Earth's Best is reported to contain BPA. My search for quality baby food continues..."
"I've fed my little pug this dog food brand all his life. Now as a young adult I feed him 2/3 cups of food daily. He's energetic, happy, and not over weight as pugs tend to get. He also has a very healthy and minimal stool - which is great because he is trained to use a litter box with a ""permanent"" type doggie pee pad (changed daily) in the bottom. Pudge is always ready to eat so, I try to give mostly healthy treats: maybe a few bites of veggies of my dinner plate and maybe a milk bone a few times a week. But he loves his Wellness and its made him a handsome, healthy little dude"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M8KYCK"">Jacobs Latte Macchiato, 8-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>I love Jacob's Latte Machiatto for the Tassimo; however, since they came out with the new packaging, every package I have opened has had about 75% of the creamer disks defective.  The barcode reader won't read it, and the machine goes into manual mode.  If I wanted to use manual mode, I'd be using a Dolce Gusto machine!  The problem only occurs with the creamer disks, not the coffee disks, and not with any other brand of beverage.  I have checked and cleaned and cleaned to scanner surface, but that is obviously not the problem - the problem is in the bar code on the packaging of the creamer disks.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed. When you consider what these things cost, it's not fun having 75% of them defective."
"I used to order Gerber 2nd Foods Bananas with Apples & Pears until I tasted it. I found it extremely sweet, so I did some research online to find out that it contains 15g of sugar per container.<br />When I looked for a substitute, I came across this fixed fruits, ""Gerber 2nd Foods Apricots with Mixed Fruit"", which has 50% less sugar (10g per container) and has apricots in addition to apples, pears and bananas.<br />My son loves this mixed fruit puree and I love it too!"
"My experience with this cheesy skillet wasn't a good one. I followed the directions but it came out kind of runny at the end and wasn't very cheesy. It may have been something I did, but the end product just wasn't very good. I'm not a big ""cheeseburger"" person anyway. I did try the chicken & broccoli skillet and it turned out amazing. I would definitely recommend that one over this skillet. I just prefer the chicken and the noodles over the hamburger and noodles in this skillet."
The Twizzlers do not taste like I remember them.  I would not recommend these to anyone unless tmhey started to make them like they use to. I was very disappointed!
"This rice cooks up perfectly in my small Aroma rice cooker, which I also bought on Amazon. Two great products, and both at a good price."
"I love ALL the Chimes ginger chews but the peanut butter is really yummy. There is no ""heat"" from the ginger and yet you get all the advantages of the ginger.  I share them with friends at the office."
"I know little about salt, but wanted to upgrade from average table salt. I am happy with this. I enjoy using it on food, and also as a mouth rinse with water. While I am not qualified to attest to the quality of this salt, I feel good having it in my kitchen, and will definitely repurchase. There is something about Himalayan Salt that makes me confident having it."
"One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost ""muddy"" odor. By ""muddy,"" I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone. A nice organic blend."
"My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  They are so healthy and yet she thinks they are a dessert.  Gerber makes a similar product, which is just as good, except these are organic.  Love that I can find 8 packs of them on Amazon.  I have a hard time finding them in stores."
I have been using this product for about 6 months. I have had consistently good results when making yogurt with this starter. I tried to make follow up batches with yogurt I had made previously and it just never was as good as using this starter every time. One of the big secrets I have found to good yogurt is making sure that you mix in the starter thoroughly. Definitely improves the consistency.
"Great shipping time and great 5 lbs of product just as described! Fresh, gummy, and coca colaee lol just as I remembered as a kid!"
"In a time where pine nuts are selling for $145 for a 5 lb. bag we were able to get quality pine nuts for just $60 for that same 5 lb bag using Amazon. Our customers have noticed no difference in flavor or after taste from those we previously purchased through our food service provider. The vendor, Candy Express, delivered their product ahead of schedule and in very good packaging."
I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!
"These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger. Although most Larabars are very delicious, and I can't say I have ever disliked any of them."
"This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical."
"All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that."
"I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more."
"I saw a bag in the grocery aisle and had to have it.  Boy, was I sorely disappointed.  The cookies aren't half as big as I remember them being.  They were all clumped together from all the nauseating pink and white frosting.  Yeah, you actually get more pink and white frosting than you do an actual cookie.  Blecch.  These cookies are a suga-holic hyperactive kid's dream and nothing more.  I won't be buying them again.  So sad to see a good, good thing go away."
"They are safe for my daughter's restricted diet, and the rest of the family loves them too.  Their small size is great for snacking, and each bag has many servings.  They are a great buy... we're already on our second case!"
my dog brandi lovessssssssssssssssssss these greenies she cant get enough of them and i keep them in cabinet she will look at cabinet and than look at me and say ma can i please have a greenie im not kiddin shes a dog but she talks to me they have there own communication.<br />anyway whoever is leary about buying these trust me when i tell you they are worth every pennie and this seller got them out to me quick!!great product great seller what more can i say but<br />merry xmas and a happy healthy new year too!!
I felt very calm and contented as I sipped this hot chocolate. I love the flavor. I wish it would come in a 2lb can.
"It's an acquired taste, but it works.  For IBS sufferers with few other options for stomach relief I'd definately give it a try."
these are great! I was very happy with how quickly they arrived. I'm always very happy with these gel colors
"We get this chai for our office and everyone loves it!  We used to buy it at Sam's Club but then couldn't find it so we buy it here by the case and split it up, some for the office, some of us take some home and some of our friends want in on the split.  It's the best Chai, next to Dunkin Donuts, I've tasted!"
"These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected."
"I was looking for a really good, healthy bar so I thought I'd try these even though they're pricey. Big mistake. I think they are tasteless and I will go back to my grocery store brand."
"Kind Plus, Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars are really good!  They're so good I've doubled my monthly order.  They're better than Snickers, and certainly better for you.  I've been diagnosed with celiac disease for 18 years, and these bars are a favorite snack."
"These Glory brand beans with potatoes taste wonderful.  I don't usually like green beans much, but the way these are seasoned makes them taste great.  (It's a salty and bacon-y flavor that is hard to describe.)  I especially like to use them as an ingredient in shepherd's pie.  The only problem I have with them here on Amazon is that the Amazon price is roughly 2½ times higher than the price in my local grocery store."
"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad!"
"This snack met all my expectations to the NI,taste, size and texture. They are very chewy and loved that. Its very filling. I will keep buying these. They are 100 percent better than adkins, slimfast and Special K I have tried in the past. Can't wait to try the other kinds."
"I purchased this ramen based on my sister recommendation like a week ago and I am down to my last 8 packs, wonderful texture on the noodles and the broth is just right. Adding kimchi as the final touch is heavenly."
"After reading other reviews I was concerned about ordering this, expecting that the cans may arrive damaged, however they were all in perfect condition. The cans were all packed tightly in a box, which was then placed within a second box for delivery. As for the product itself, I had been using a coconut milk from a carton that was smooth and did not separate. This coconut milk separates into the coconut water and coconut cream, so when the can is opened, the harder coconut cream is on top and the water is underneath. Since I only use 1 serving at a time (1/4 cup) this means dividing the cream and coconut water separately. I tried blending it in a blender but it still did not blend together. The taste is comparable to other coconut milks I have tried."
I have used this Buttermilk Mix and found it to be very good.  I don't always have fresh buttermilk and having this mix on hand is great.  I am looking forward to the many more recipes that I can prepare on the spur of the moment.
"Just purchased this, used almost a tablespoon to make 1 cup. This tea is horrendous. Cheap, bland, barely distinguishable flavor. Wasted time and money."
"Is this a joke?  $44 for 2 lbs of bone-in ribs?  If you live in any top 30 US cities, find a Korean market where they have this for $6 a lb."
"Both the product page and the seller were equally unenlightening, so I'll tell you: the package I got contains 3.5 ounces of black salt, packaged by Deep Foods."
"I consume vitamin drinks pretty regularly. I just couldn't get into the taste of this product. It was a bit bland and I wasn't comfortable with the amount I had to use to make it taste ""right"" in my water. Even after 2 1/2 squeezes it still tasted like a powder drink with no sugar added. I was really hoping for a better experience.<br />I also wasn't too happy with the ingredient list:<br />Water, Citric Acid, Vitamin C, Natural Flavor, Sucralose, Natural Caffeine, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Magnesium Lactate, Gluconate Vitamin B3, Taurine, Vitabin B5, Calcium Lactate, Gum Acacia, Glyceryl, Abietate, Red 40, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12<br /><br />I think they should have added 10 calories and went with a more natural sugar to kick up the flavor a bit.<br /><br />For those that are okay with drinking just water and just want to add some vitamins to the experience - this may be the product for you. If you are trying to eat/drink better and want to give up soda for something ""healthy"", the bland flavor may not do it for you."
"I think this product is very good.  I have had some better freeze dried fruit.  I would prefer if the pieces were bigger, but other than that it is a could product."
"My favorite blend of my favorite coffee.  Used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime I went out to the midwest! Now I can get in k-cups.  Yay! Good price on amazon, but super saver shipping takes forever! Fedexing it to the post office makes no sense.  just fedex it to me and shave 2 days off the wait already!"
I've fed Zuke's treats for awhile (3+ years) but the last two bags gave my dogs horrible upset stomach.  I bought a massive bag too and had to throw them both away.  I unfortunately will not be buying these again.
"This is one of my favorite herbal teas for everyday drinking. It's very appley compared to some other brands of apple cinnamon tea, but the apple and cinnamon components are well-balanced with the chamomile to make a flavorful tea. I recommend Subscribe and Save, because this tea can be addictive. You will run out before you know it!"
These taste as good to me as the ones filled with sugar.  I love them so much I ordered about 4lbs and put them airtight bags.
"overall, good.  lots of big pieces but naturally, there were some smaller ones.  consistency overall was good, not great.  some pieces were a bit hard and others were just right.  due to the size of the bag, you need to either eat alot of it, share with friends immediately, or put it in the fridge after 1-2 days which would make the pieces harder."
Ahmad fruit flavored teas are my favorite.  So glad that Amazon is carrying them now.  I had to rely on one box here and there in Marshalls but now I can stock up.<br /><br />All the flavors are very natural tasting and the tea is full bodied and satifying.
"Fantastic balsama glaze.  I am an exceptional home chef and have been pricing this item at stores like William Sonoma Sur La Table etc and this is by far the best bang for the buck.  I love this type of white vinegar glaze especially when preparing appetizers like watermelon, goat cheese, balsma, olive oil, and mint.  A darker glaze would take away from the appearance and taste of the salad.  Just love Amazon and all the great items I buy."
Firenze Roast is A smooth tasting coffee with many flavors. Pure art! Nice aftertaste. With a light roast you can't cheat on quality of the coffee. All Arabica Beans. Made in Seattle USA. Not to mention The USA has more buying power with brokers so The USA gets the highest quality coffee beans in the world. Caffe D'Arte may be the best!
"I liked this packaging because it cuts down on the amount of plastic, so I was very sorry that Amazon was no longer going to carry it. Just another case of finally finding a good product only to have it removed from availability."
"Tastes great, makes a nice flavor with veggies for a simple soup. I use it frequently as a booster with my vita mix for extra flavor. It may not be super healthy or whatnot but if your like me and cant stand reduced sodium or low fat canned soup because they are flavorless give this a shot I think you would be pleasantly surprised."
"Please see my raving review of NB's Duck and Potato Canned Dog Food.<br /><br />My Chow Chow adores this treat. This is her all time favorie, and she gobbles it up every time it is offered to her.<br /><br />My picky Shih Tzu won't touch this treat, but to be fair and honest she doesn't touch any treats with the exception of freeze dried ducks feet which cost me $12/6 feet...<br /><br />I would recommend people try the product though as it is unlikely a dog would have any dietary sensativities to the formula, which is a common concern these days."
"i started buying this instead of peanut butter when i developed a peanut sensitivity while pregnant, and was surprised at how good it is.  if i'd known, i would have tried it years ago, so i hope by passing along the word, i can help someone else out."
"I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry."
"This vegan chocolate is really tasty, and it has small pieces of peaches in the bar. I've never tried peaches with chocolate, but the peaches blend in nicely. I am not vegan, but I enjoyed the chocolate bar anyway."
"I had this cake while in the Cayman's...this was just like I remembered it ! Arrived promptly, the cake was moist & flavorful."
This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
"I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An internet order was lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number. When asked for one the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. Ann, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: Here it is almost a month later. I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?"
My son loves all the happy Tot foods we have tried. If he see's me putting them away he gets so excited and wants one right then.
I love reading amazon reviews because it can be very insightful at times  and feel compelled to give one. Everything was perfect and really liked the wheatgrass. I would recommend this wheatgrass growing kit to all.
"Izzy, our rescue Mini Schnauzer, has tummy issues. We've had to go to a sensitive stomach dog food, and be very careful with what we feed her for snacks and treats. We've been looking for treats she'll like, with ingredients she can have, and made in the United States. With Zuke's we get it all.<br /><br /> We also have to limit how much treat she can get in a day, but with the small size of these treats, about the size of pencil eraser tips, so we can give her 3 or 4 and use them as rewards when training.<br /><br />She loves the salmon flavor, and while I can smell they are salmon, they don't stink and my hands aren't gross after giving Izzy her treats. So far we have hadn't any bad reactions and she enjoys getting a yummy treat, she doesn't have to know it's good for her too!"
"I like the taste of this dressing, but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. This chemical gives me migraines, which is very difficult to tolerate. I am sorry to say that I will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer."
I used this in my families xmas grab bag.  It was a hit and was stolen several times during the course of the game.  If you have someone who was young in the 60s but not too young to remember this will make a great gift.
I purchased this item because I had previously purchased the larger bag of mixed chips. I love these because they are low sodium and really taste like sweet potatoes. It's nice to find a really good healthy and tasty alternative to the high-sodium snack items in the marketplace.
I love the nacho flavor corn nuts.  Cheesy nutty taste!  And the 1.7oz pk is a perfect snacking size.  Would recommend for corn nut lovers.
"Don't like raisins,but currants are a great substitute. I loved this product. It was amazingly sweet.Very good flavor,moist and chewy."
"Kudos to Nabisco for coming out with a new delicious cookie! Unlike the traditional Chips Ahoy cookie which is crunchy texture (and I'm not criticizing it, by the way), this one is chewy and has a fudge center in the middle in addition to the quintessential chocolate chips. My wife enjoyed it, too. We'll be looking for them at our supermarket (these went pretty quickly)."
"I ordered all the nostalgic candy boxes and it was fun to reminise about the days when all this candy was ""penny"" candy that we ran to the corner store to spend our allowance on. The good ol' days. For the most part the candy was okay although a lot of it was stale tasting and many pieces had outdated codes on them. Sugar doesnt normally go bad so this was not impressive. When you compare the price of yester year and what I paid in todays market, I think I'll try making my own from an old candy cookbook nextime. It was very overpriced for what it was. I hadhoped it would come in some kind of old time tin instead of a cardboard display box. Then the price would have been worth it."
I love this milk.  I dilute it to 2 quarts and it tastes great.
"Plus:<br />- Good deal on the price and love the convenience of free delivery.<br />- Subscribe and Save saves money.<br />- Son ate it.<br />- Not always in stock at stores so online good buy.<br />- Like the 8 ounce size containers.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />- Son gets constipated with the Rice cereal, the Oatmeal is much better.<br />- Uses to much breast milk when mixing together.<br />- If you mix by directions won't be the right consistency to feed baby.<br /><br />I would buy one package first and see how your child reacts to the Rice before you buy the pack of 6 like I did."
"Like many, I have cycled through many different brands and k-cups, searching for the perfect blend to satisfy my taste buds.  I prefer a medium roast, but slightly bold.  Tullys House blend fits that bill perfectly for me and my fiance.  The flavor is mild but not flavorless like some other medium blends, and bold enough to wake me up."
"These treats are tiny and GREAT for training--low calorie, yet so aromatic that my dog jumps for joy as he smells them. The customer service was great, except they back-ordered one package of the treats, assured me they should be here in a few weeks; I've been waiting a month for the item."
"These proved a great addition to the lunch cooler for a couple folks I know who weren't interested in mixing and bottling up powered versions.  They're stronger than plastic bottles, don't leak when bounced around, and fit well into the cooler or lunch bucket."
"Very sugary, a sugar cookie is more descriptive...very good for a sugar cookie though, guess I was expecting a buttery shortbread...a bit disappointed.<br /><br />All Pepperidge Farm cookies have great eye appeal, but they are run by big business.<br /><br />They hop theirs up with too much grainy sugar...just tried the milk chocolate chips kind too...not at all like homemade, because of the grainy, overly sugary taste."
"A ""dessert"" I like:<br />Pero, sweetener, ricotta cheese...<br />Another way to enjoy the nice flavor of Pero."
We are surviving summer with treats from home.  Also using small amount of the SUGAR FREE flavors in our bottled water - instead of crystal lite.
"I stumbled upon this cracker at TJMaxx.  I needed a quick snack and decided to try these.  This cracker was a delightful surprise.  It fits my every craving and I didn't know what I wanted until I tried this cracker.  I quickly (within a week) ordered the snack packs from Amazon.  I've gone through a box every few days.  It's addicting, but SO good.  I intend to order more and I also tried the classic 3 seed (YUM)!  My only complaint....DOCTOR CRACKER!!!! please don't skimp on the pumpkin seeds and the cheese.  I have to rummage through and eat all the loaded ones first.  The naked one's get eaten last, but they get eaten (EVEN EVERY LAST CRUMB)!!!!"
"I think the name should be changed to Soy Crispy Bar because ""Granola"" is a stretch here. Surprisingly lacking in much flavor, just way too sweet, not rich chocolate tasting and far from satisfying for the 110 calorie three little airy bites. This is mostly soy crunchy bits and sugar, far from real granola with whole grains and lasting satisfaction. This is a pretty empty bar nutritionally speaking and weak on flavor to boot, I just can't personally justify putting this in my body, have an apple!"
We first tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend coffee when we purchased our Koerig coffee maker.  The flavor fit us both perfectly.  Now that's all we drink.
"Just be forewarned it is a bit ""moist.""  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it.<br /><br />However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!<br /><br />My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well :-)"
"Like being misled much? If they are willing to mislead you from the start, what else are they doing that they arent telling you about?<br /><br />The front of the bottle says ""reduced sugar""<br /><br />The promotional literature says ""This Ketchup recipe has 75 percent less sugar than our classic Ketchup, but 100 percent of that rich tomato flavor. Just like all Heinz® Ketchup varieties, it contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.""<br /><br />Notice something?? They dont mention that they replace sugar with sucralose; a chlorinated sweetener (chlorine has a byproduct dioxin which the EPA found to be 300,000 times as carcinogenic as the pesticide DDT.-mercola)<br /><br />When i wrote Heinz to suggest they print ""artificially sweetened"" below their massive 'reduced sugar banner' their response to me was search for the fine print on the back of the bottle. Does that sound forthright to you? Does that sound like they are trying to keep the customer fully informed? Kind of a shady practice and a shady response from the company."
"Tea is good. Wish there would have been a little more variety. It came with the English breakfast black tea which I already had come with the Keurig. The only new ones I got were green tea, sleepy time tea & a lemon zinger:) All of which I like just was expecting a little more (than 4) variety"
"If you can get Madwoman Food's pre-made pie crust (and can afford them) they're THE best. But if you just want to make pie crust at home - this stuff is the bomb!  Makes a nicely textured, good-tasting pie crust. You'll never know it's GF!  Most of the others are hard as a rock and taste off to boot. Not this!"
"the size of each particle is quite good for dog training. and the smell is very strong, you cannot put them in a open bag, must seal it everytime you gave it as treat, otherwise your dog will stand up trying to fetch more.<br />i believe the taste is great from my puppy's affection for it, and i will purchase more for sure."
"The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?"
"I bought these with the hopes of satisfying my craving for something low glycemic and crunchy.  I am thrilled with them! They taste great and totally hit the spot when you need a quick snack. I do wish they were bigger pieces as the rounds are somewhat smaller then I expected, but the taste out weighs that con! I will buy these again for sure!"
"It tastes OK, but it has too many carbs. I am on a low carb diet and I gained four pounds after I started drinking this (nothing else in my diet changed). They came off when I quit."
"My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . ."
This jerky is very very bad. Its so salty that u can't actually taste the jerky. The meat seems to be very rubbery with no taste whatsoever.
"I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games. I was so happy to find a non-breakable, organic, BPA free food for her. I keep these in her diaper bag so when she is hungry, she always has a healthy meal. She likes them all but her top two are spinach/mango/pear and sweet potato/apple! I love that they combine fruits, veggies and super grains!"
"I have purchased this product many times. But this time I was disappointed. The large dog chews have always had different thicknesses, but this bag was all just above paper thin. The point of the chew is not just the chemical for tarter, they have to chew on it for a while, ant that thin of a stripe results in very little chewing."
"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior."
These wafer have a very bright lemony filling and dont taste like they are gluten free cookies. I have to keep them away from my kids!
"I love the Frapp lights.  I've been drinking these for the past few months they are lighter, not as thick as the original and fewer calories...plus, plus, plus.  Recently I purchased and tried to drink a regular Frapp but couldn't now that I've gotten accustomed to the taste of the light. There is a definite difference in taste and if you are not a fan of Splenda, I do not recommend this drink, nowever if you are...it's great!"
"I have 3 cats who have ""kitty treat withdrawal"" when they don't get their Temptations treats everyday.  The price for the treats from Amazon is much better than anywhere I can purchase them in my area and on auto delivery I get free shipping, too.  The auto ship also lets me know how much I am using.  Great product!"
The popcorn is fresher and fluffier than I remember.  And there are enough peanuts to add that something extra that plain caramel corn doesn't have. The bags are a good size for a snack.
"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."
"My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition.  After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat.  The old cat would eat anything.  The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food.  He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat.  That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list.  The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives.  The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it.  When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione.  I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health.  The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses.  Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion.  (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite.  I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion.  Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients.  No by-products here!  It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it.  He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it.  I've tried every single flavor of the ""in gravy"" flavors (I haven't tried the ""in gelee"" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this.  There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it.  There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition.  I'm sold!"
I have been buying this for at least two years now.  It makes great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that are figure friendly.  My daughter has used it in smoothies and likes it too.  I must say though the price on Amazon is higher than buying it directly from Bell Plantation.  I will probably purchase it next time from them.
"But I don't.  I usually get my iced coffee ""regular"" so I thought this would be perfect for me, save a few steps.  The coffee is very weak, they recommend brewing at the 6 oz size for best results (and even that is still weak), for me on a hot summer day, thats only a few sips. Also the sweetener that they used is VERY artificial tasting.  I am a Splenda and an Equal user so I wasn't looking for real sugar taste but this is just weird tasting.  I will finish the 2 boxes I bought, try to share with some friends, but I will not buy these again, they didn't live up to their name for me."
I did not like the taste of this hot chocolate and my kids didn't either.  I will not buy again.
"These are a pretty spicy. The taste is very similar to the ""Flamming Cheetto's"" but with the tangy taste of lemon."
These chips are wonderful. The BBQ and the Salt and Vinegar are both great. The serving size is very generous and the texture of the chip is great. I got these when they were the Deal of the Day and I'm very surprised at how great they taste!
My cairn terrier Daisy loves these basted bones. Having trouble<br />finding them in retail. I hope its not a sign that the product<br />is discontinued. She also likes the peanut butter basted flavor.
"I bought this set mainly for the red.  I bake and decorate with frosting/icing quite a bit, so I was excited to get so many colors that were supposed to be of better quality than Wilton.  I used an entire bottle of red in 3 cups of buttercream frosting.  The darkest it would get was a watermelon color.  By the time I got to that point, my frosting had broken and looked terrible.  The royal blue wasn't much better.  The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I haven't used all of the colors yet, just red and blue.  I will stick with store bought red frosting and Wilton gel colors for everything else."
"If you LOVE cinnamon, this is apparently the tea to buy, especially in satchels in the more expensive tin. Based on the rave reviews, I bought the economical box - and, for a gift to have on hand, the nice-looking tin . . . before realizing that the satchels in the tin are touted to taste better than the 50 bags in the box. Glad the gift tea should be better! I LIKE cinnamon - but to love these tea bags, it would help if you love cinnamon (especially if you enjoy Red Hots or hot spicy food). I usually enjoy my tea strong and with milk, but I suspect I'll be diluting this one with lots of milk. So far, I've found Harney & Sons tea to be high-quality tea - and cinnamon is healthy, so I'm okay with this purchase. But I don't plan to restock this zinger in my pantry :)"
"I am 26 years old.<br />I don't know what it tasted like in 1940s, or a little later.<br />It was popular in all around the world, I suppose, carbonated soda, cold soft drinks.<br />All I remember that my father used to tell me, there used to be a place here, which bottled in front of your eyes, in glass bottle; in lemon flavor, a orange, that's what it was those days in Turkey.<br />I came to USA, and all I drank was Coca Cola; Pepsi, etc etc.<br />But this,<br />I tasted this in NC, Chapel Hill.<br />Just saw a bottle soda, and decided to try it.<br />I also tried Cherry soda that the same company makes.<br />For what it tastes:<br />Think of Club soda that you can buy in a grocery store, think it as a soda with salt and this metal taste; and then taste this.<br />You will recognize the difference.<br />THe only problem is that there is limited availability, they need more bottling plants so that more people can taste.<br />Cheers.<br /><br />Oz"
"While trying to cut back on carbs, and add more protein to my diet, I discovered this wonderful tasty snack.  At 260 calories, even this 1.5 oz pack is too much for a snack, but I divide the packs in half again and have a healthy snack that helps satisfy my hunger in the late afternoon.  They're also good as a breakfast on the run. The wasabi adds a wonderful punch-love them!"
Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.
I bought this product this product from Amazon for 2-3 times now. I basically go for it whenever I plan to go home on vacation. My friends and relatives just love all 7 types of chocolates this particular packet contains. Most of them are my favorites too :)<br /><br />Also delivery was done in 3 business days through USPS.<br />Recommended !!!
"Whisker Lickin's is a great product for your cat. I have used WL for years and my cat never turns away,<br />I fact my cat prefers this product over any dry food I have feed her--So Whisker Lickin's is now<br />my cats dry food of choice and Amazon has the best price going that I could find !! GREAT PRODUCT !!"
I have been enjoying these for a few months now. Brazil nuts are an excellent source of selenium. Four a day is all you need. Chew them well.
"Our fat orange tabby had been on Science Diet all 9 years of his life. He started hurling on the carpet more then usual (usual being kitty revenge for some slight) so we contacted my boyfriend's sister who has been a vet for over 15 years. She said sometimes manufacturers just change the ratios or ingredients in a cat food and it doesn't set well with some consumers. Eukanuba was one of the recommended brands -- a kennel I worked at in college swore by it -- so we weaned him onto it and no issues since. I'd recommend it solely because he's picky ( hates treats, milk, cream, tuna fish oil ... Everything ) and because it settled his stomach."
The price was right; a bulk order is convenient rather than purchasing small portions. Accomodations to flavor must be made. It is not like any other vanilla I have used. It did not have an essence that I am accustomed to. Has an odd 'after taste' and baking results are different. This may well be due to my limited culinary experience. I would like to offer an A+ to the vendor as I let them know and they very graciously and promptly made ammendments for this persnickety buyer.
I ordered this to try it to see if I would like it so I only ordered a single bag.  Big mistake! I should have ordered at least the 3 pack!  It has such a great blueberry flavor and I can't find it anywhere locally.  I will be placing another order soon!
I enjoy one or two of these a day and don't feel guilty about it.  It tastes great and is way less damaging than soda.
"A great product at a great price.  These little slim jim snacks taste much better than the full version sold in convenience stores.  Not sure why, but they do.  Others have written the same thing.  Very convenient box and easy to store.  Makes a great adder for school lunches and etc, or just a quick snack on the run."
"I think these things are disgusting.  I have celiac disease so I gave these a try one day when (after 5 years of not having had a pretzel!) I had a craving - it was like eating really, really, really HARD cardboard.  Tasteless and HARD.  I'd rather go 5 years more than eat another one of these pretzels!"
"""Oatmeal Squares"" is in about the largest print you can fit on the Front of the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour. So how can it rightfully be called a ""Crunchy Oat Cereal"".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker, which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.  This is really ""Oatmeal and Wheat Squares""<br /><br />Who cares how it tastes if it is not what it says it is."
"My dog loves this food! She seems to have new found energy.... and I love the price! Compared to other healthy foods, you can't beat the price."
"my fiance has a gluten intolerance, this is the best flout or mix we have found. it makes things taste like they should (as if they were made with regular flour) also a big plus is you can eat the dough (think cookies) with most gluten free flours the dough or batter taste terrible not with this one"
"I was tired of paying $$$ for dal at my local ""gourmet"" grocery and too home-bound to travel up to the Indian part of town, so I bought these online. Later discovered the same lentils much more reasonably priced in the aisle with the Mexican food."
This is horrible! DO NOT BUY! This coffee tastes nothing like something from Maui nor has it sat even near to a vanilla bean or any kind of nut! You'd be better off buying foldger's or maxwell house. It was over roasted\scortched and ground way too fine. I cant believe anyone liked this at all! I have to believe the positive reviews are from friends and relatives. what a waste of my money.
"Fabulous cookie.  Perfect size.  Love packaging.  No more stale cookies.  Senior size, just enough with a cup of coffee (or tea) for a snack.  Wish all food was like that."
Everyone in my family loves these. The are a cross between a twizzler and a fruit snack. They come individually wrapped so they are easy to take on the go or throw into lunches. There are 70 calories per package. Which isn't to bad since they are pretty chewy and fun to eat.  I would recommend these to friends and family. They are a treat you can feel good about eating.
"This product is awesome! I love the eye dropper bottle, it allows you to just put a few drops in or a whole lot!"
"An excellent tasting tomato puree, quite unusual as it is made from yellow and not red ones.  It had a wonderful sweet taste, less acidity than a red puree.  It made an outstanding sauce that was great on ravioli.  Additionally, I used it as the sauce for a lasagna, resulting in an unusual dish both by taste and visually.  I highly recommend this product it you want to stray from the mainstream of typical red sauces."
Luci is  park  husky  park  Great Dane  she is 100 pound  dog and  chews these up  alot  1  week  not tobad  the other I bought  from the name  brand stores  last  1 day
"This is nice different tea. It is not too sweet but flavorful. Although it says Blackberry Vanilla, neither flavor is overwhelming. It brews readily and you can actually get probably a cup and a half from one teabag. I really like the new tea bags that seem to get the flavor out quicker than the old style teabags. I probably won't buy this tea as I prefer the regular tea as it has a stronger flavor. This tea would be nice for someone looking for a flavorful non-caffeinated tea."
"I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe."
Pb 2 is good in smoothies or baking when you want a PB flavor without the fat.  It's low in calories and still has enough protein and other  nutrients after the processing.  I would prefer to have no sugar added or at least substitute the sugar with Stevia.  Otherwise it is a really useful and good tasting product.
"This is an unbelievable deal. For the same price as the mystery cube o' leaves you find at Asian grocers or internet vendors, you get a full pound of Organic leaves. The Gunpowder Green has a hint of citrus, a hint of nuttiness, but most importantly, it tastes clean. You don't have to worry about undoing the health benefits of green tea with heavy metals or other pollutants in non-organic products. The 16 Oz. bag lasted me over two months with several strong cups per day. I highly recommend this tea."
"Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf K-Cup's are great. Probably the best cup of decaf I have ever had, no kidding.  I have had many different kinds of Decaf. The only problem is that it is so good it makes me want to drink more than I usually do so there goes more money but well worth it!!! :-)"
"I have tried quite a few coffee substitutes, this one isn't just for a sub.  It actually has very healthful things in it, and is caffine free, has antioxidents in it and even has elimination assistance.  We don't drink it because of lower acid (it is actually alkaline)it also helps with acid stomic, I have even been able to avoid taking zantac for a while.  It also gives a natural energy boost, it isn't difficult to get accustomed to the favor, you just can't expect it to taste exactly like coffee, pero is actually closer to coffee flavor if that's what you're looking for.  Beware of Yerba Mate, I checked it out, it is extremely high in caffine and price."
Kong Stuff'N Snacks make a perfect stuffer for the Kong Classic Dog Toy. Much better and less messy than peanut butter. Keeps the dogs occupied for at least 20 minutes or longer. And the dogs love 'em! Just wish they were a tad cheaper or had more in the package.
"This stuff is nasty. It's the most fakest tasting queso I've had in a long time. You get what you pay for. It's cheap and it tastes like it. I like Taco Bell branded taco and fajita sauces, so I thought it was worth a shot. It was not. Just gross. Took one bite and threw it out.<br /><br />The crazy thing is the label says its made with Kraft cheese. Kraft should cancel this cross-branding immediately. It makes them look bad. They must put a piece of Kraft in with a bunch of cheese-flavored gunk."
Why is the box of 10 $10 @ Amazon when I can buy this for $4 at the grocery store? Is there a pricing problem?
"I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />""...let's get together and feel all right""  Indeed."
"Nature's Path is a brand I know and trust. Very tasty breakfast surprise. Very vanilla, very crunchy and full of good nutrition. Recommend"
"I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn. Some complain it doesn't all pop, that's because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop. It always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up. I love it."
"Healthy Choice used to be a byword for mediocre diet food. During the last few years, however, they've gotten better and better, producing tasty grub at reasonable prices and with some real health advantages over things like, say, Banquet TV dinners.<br /><br />This latest product, a tasty Ziti with meat sauce, is a little different from some of their others. First, it doesn't need freezing. Second, you cook the pasta by dumping in water, nuking it and then straining it through the nifty little strainer lid! This makes it ideal for a compact lunch you can take to work. All you need is some water and a microwave and happiness will ensue!<br /><br />As far as the taste goes? I was surprised! The pasta came out nice and tender and there was a good mix of flavors in the meat suace as well as some chunks of what I really hope were actually meat. Even better, someone who likes to eat large, I'll tell you this actually left me nice and full and not feeling like I needed to eat anything else right away.<br /><br />Very good product. Highly recommended!"
"I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know."
"I've become a fan of Hint water over the last year and tried a couple of the flavors.  I like the Pomegranate-Tangerine but am also partial to the Grapefruit flavor.  It's more of a personal preference than anything else so if you know you like these flavors, chances are you'll find these waters delicious.<br /><br />I enjoy how these taste when chilled.  I have also drank them at the gym a little less cold and find it is much better when straight from the refrigerator since the flavors are more strong.  As the name implies, it is just a hint of flavor, not meant to taste overly sweet or like a juice.  I prefer this, but some people might find the flavor not intense enough for their liking.<br /><br />Purchasing these on Amazon is so helpful since you can order in bulk and get a great deal and not have to carry or transport a heavy case home."
"These are great chips!  They have just as much flavor as a full fat chip and all of the crunch, but they are at least moderately healthy.  I pack them in my husband's and children's lunches.  Everyone loves them."
"I own a 7 year old Frenchie. Frenchies are know for allergies to all the GRAIN and BI-PRODUCTS that are the primary substances of most dog foods. Folks, just check the ingredients in the average dog food, and then compare it to BLUE BUFFALO WILDERNESS. My dog has been on this brand of food for 3 weeks now and this is what has happened: His paw licking due to allergies has basically ended. His eye allergies have ended. And the biggest thing, his ear itching and ""funkyness"" is all but gone. I can not say enough about this type of food. I'm just sorry it took me 7 years to figure it out. I will never feed my dogs anything but ""Grain Free Dog Food"" from now on. This is NO GIMMICK which is hard to find in anything nowadays! I hope this reaches many folks that can take advantage of this type of food. Your ""Best Friends"" will thank you forever."
"[...]<br /><br />Please check this out and DO NOT feed these to your pets.  Take them back to where you bought them and make them aware, MADE IN CHINA."
"I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.<br /><br />I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.<br /><br />This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.<br /><br />Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan."
"I started drinking Hint Water a few years ago when Smartwater discontinued its similar line of no-calorie, no-artificial-sweetners, lightly flavored waters.  I find that I drink a lot more water during the day with these than with filtered water.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and refreshing ---- just a tiny hint of flavoring.  No syrupy flavor like all the trendy ""fitness drinks"" out there and no carbonation or harmful artificial sweetners like with diet soda.<br /><br />I was an absolute Diet Coke junkie for fifteen years until I found this product.  No hyperbole ---- it's literally the only thing that I can keep in the fridge that will keep me away from Diet Coke.  It might seem a bit pricey, but for my health I think it is worth every penny.  I just wish they would stock a larger size so I wouldn't feel so bad about all of the discarded plastic bottles.  Also, this may seem a small point but I am a sculptor and thoughtful graphic design is very important to me.  I always get compliments when I hand these out to guests ---- both on the flavor and the wonderful packaging.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are the pear and the watermelon.  They are very subtle.  My husband's favorite is the honeydew-hibiscus.  I like it, too, but it has a tiny sour floral tang to the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this product highly enough."
First time I purchased from this company and very disappointed as the coffee came all lose in the shipping box..Not even in their original manufacturers Keurig Tully Boxes.. some tops ripped open due to the packaging not to mention there are no expiration dates on these K-Cups.. Maybe this deal was too good to be true.. Do not recommend.. rather pay little more for quality packing and product...:(
"If you want a tea biscuit or should I know say cookie - then look no further than these british mcvities digestives<br />Very addictive, once you start, hence I buy 6 packs!<br />I just wish the chocolate digestives did not cost so much as I would buy some of them too!<br />Great cookie for after meal treat, my kids love 'em"
"I am combining white and whole-grain flours for my bread machine (60% white+40% brown) resulting in a ""half brown"" loaf of bread. Whole-grain flour needs a ""booster"" to properly rise and to get a more airy, less dense texture. I ordered several brands of ""Dough enhancer"" from Amazon to compare and to try out of them. I tried Barry Farm's in accordance with the suggested usage but the result was disappointing.<br />The bread not only rose less than usual but the crust got severely burned - using standard machine setting. The failure was so palpable that I discarded the product after only one application. I found other enhancers from Amazon which worked wonderfully."
"Not for the faint of heart. Get ready to be very productive, this brew is strong and will light the jet fires!"
"What can I say? The cat loved it and lapped every bit of it up from her bowl. She is usually a picky eater, but this suited her fancy. What more can you ask of a cat food!"
"This is the second time I have ordered and gotten Stride 2.0.  Stride 2.0 is not near as good as stride original which is advertised in the photo and in the description.  Now I can't return this item.  You should update the picture to advertise this as Stride 2.0.  Believe me there is a difference and when you have a gum habit like I do, it matters."
"I thought this was a great purchase and of great quality. No problems with my purchase. It arrived speedily. We had some of the wheat couscous the next day with our meal for dinner. Our 2 sons love couscous, and the older son went back for thirds. It was loved by the whole family. Can't wait to try the other flavors. I have plans for the tomato flavored one."
"I began taking this tea at 36 weeks. I was drinking three cups a day. To me the taste was rather bland, but honestly I was not drinking it for the taste, I was drinking it with the hopes that it would strengthen and tone my uterus. I did not have any abnormal side effects or cramping from this tea. I used an epidural during delivery and even though from what I heard about epidurals making for a longer ""pushing"" stage of labor, mine was actually unbelievably quick! My doctor had me push three times per contraction. Baby crowned within the first contraction, and was born on the third. I pushed for less than ten minutes! Could it have been the tea? I like to think so. This was my first baby, and even doctor and nurses commented on how well it went! I told them it must have been the tea. haha, Since this was first pregnancy I really have nothing to compare it to, but when breastfeeding I do not feel any cramping and had very limited cramping postpartum. A couple of times the day of & day after delivery. I have continued to drink one cup a day since baby's birth. Figure it can't hurt in helping uterus tone up & get back to size over next few weeks or so..."
"Did you guys know that this product is sold at the 99c store?? I hope you are not buying it here, because the price is even higher than the regular grocery store that sell it for around $2.00 each!  This is highway robbery!  The cake is amazing in taste and texture though! :)"
"I am by no means a coconut expert but, I do know taste. Roland's coconut milk is light and creamy, with a hint of coconut. It is relatively sweetless, so if your looking for something that has very little sugar with a nice after taste, this is it. It is very smooth but the only thing which is a downer is there are tiny bits of coconut milk that have condensed. Not bad but if you don't use enough sugar it will be a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  E.A.C"
"My cat loves this food. It's the only food she'll eat. I've tried some other dry foods, just to give her some variety, but she refuses to eat them. She won't touch wet food, either. I like the fact that it's grain-free, too. Cats don't eat grain. They're carnivores. It does have greens and fiber, which is good for them, especially since my cat is strictly indoors."
My mother lives in Colorado and is on a very fixed low income. If I send her money she won't use it so I have found I can help her by buying her groceries off Amazon and having them sent directly to her house and this enables me to be able to help her. THANK YOU Amazon for having products like this on your site. I hope you continue to work with companies and make this affordable to have groceries shipped this way and also to save us the hassels of going to the grocery store when we can have it delivered to our house for about the same cost as going to the grocery store.
"This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted."
This product sells around $1.69 in Pets stores.  It is still expensive to buy this treat in bulk online
"My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton"
"These were very good tasting and packed with honey!  Be good to have when you have a cold or a sore throat--plus, they are filled with vitamins.<br /><br />Nice alternative to cough drops!"
"Like other reviewers, I ordered this item and received an incorrect order. I will NOT be ordering this again! I received 2 dinner variety packs and 0 antioxidant packs, instead of one of each. I am furious. I order on Amazon out of convenience and to save myself the trouble of having to shop many stores. This error means that I will have to spend more time shopping. In addition, there is no way to get any recourse for this error! I'm certainly not going to the hassle of returning it at this point!"
"This is a good value, we save even more with scheduled monthly delivery. Really helps with a 4 cat family!"
My daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. I try to feed my daughter organic stuff and I'm so glad that Earth's Best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
"These nutrients are semi-decent. Just add a squeeze to the water you are drinking and you are done with your daily vitamins. Except if you have allergies to dairy/milk, are a vegan, or don't like highly synthetic vitamins. Then, consider <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U2FTA8"">Emergen-C Immune Defence, 30-Count</a> instead."
"Candy is delicious, as is all Godiva. They don't skimp on the flavor, so it's not a ""cheap version"" of Godiva. But it's overpriced here, as they are sold in most drugstores for $5.99 a bag. If my arithmetic is still good, 6 x 4 =24, so there is no need to buy it online, unless you live somewhere very rural. Thanks!"
These are fresh and tasty. Great fruit flavor and no black licorice beans. Just perfect for our Easter Baskets. Love it!!
"I am a fan of strong coffee and I really enjoyed Emeril's Big Easy k-cups, but this version has a pretty bitter aftertaste.  I'm guessing it's because it's decaf, as I'm having trouble finding a good decaf k-cup.  So I guess for a decaf it's okay if you like strong Starbucks-like coffee, but I'm going to keep trying to find one that's not so bitter before buying this again."
"These k-cups taste good and are great for a quick Chai fix. They're also a good coffee alternative, but they not good enough to replace my Starbucks stop for a Chai latte or an Apple Chai."
"When you search for a product, the stars that come up are supposed to represent if people like the PRODUCT or not.  Sure, Amazon is (for whatever reason) overcharging.  However, this is a great brand, and sweet potatoes is my sons favorite veggie!  These jars are the perfect food!"
"I have fed Canidae All Life Stages food for several years to my mixed dog collection, with great results, but for some reason, had not offered the Snap Biscuits.  Finally, I purchased a bag and offered them up.  Well, they must taste treat-like because they gobble them up, and have evidenced no digestive upsets.  Safe and tasty is the verdict.  My test group is aged two years through 10 years, size eight to twenty-five pounds, in generally good health."
I'm loving this coffee!! It's smooth and bold but not too bold. It reminds me of starbucks coffee but not as bitter. Very very very good cup of coffee. Give it a try. I'm really glad I did.
"I started buying this salsa about 2 years ago on a whim. It was a little more expensive then I would normally buy, but after the first bite I knew why. This salsa has a heavier texture than most and pairs well with a thicker chip. It's not spicy, but it does have a full flavor. Occasionally I noticed an extra kick of vinegar, but this varied bottle to bottle. My only problem is that I am now hooked, but many of the supermarkets around me stopped carrying it. If you find some and want to splurge a little this is a great way to do it. My only warning is that it's hard to go back to other salsa's afterward."
I love the spicey taste of these snack chips. They have lots of protein and are quite filling. They are one of the best protein snacks I've found.
This oil is a solid at room temp but quickly melts over low heat and cooks at a low temp better than olive oil.  The flavor is also somewhat sweet and very different from olive oil.  We like it!  We purchased two packs of 2.
This is a lovely and relaxing cup to have when it is cold and frosty outside.  It has a nice and not overpowering pumpkin spice flavor and will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. This also makes a very convenient brew.  Just boil water and add mix for a perfect pumpkin spice latte.
"As truffle lovers, we took a truffle hunting trip with Truffle Hunters, the makers of this oil. We returned with several bottles of their truffle oil and I can say that this is the best truffle oil on the market. You can tell it is authentic, not flavored with artificial, chemical flavors, because you can see actual truffle shavings in each bottle. We're so pleased to know that we'll be able to replenish our supply on Amazon, rather than having to contact the company in the UK. Now if only they would also sell their wonderful truffles on Amazon!!"
"This product is really good on all fish, even canned tuna.  Try it with canned tuna or salmon and mayo.  It's also real tasty on any white fish fried or baked with olive oil."
"Amazon has made a great service introduce me to Kitchens of India products. These spicy Indian meals makes lunches during work a very simple endeavor. However, after trying several varieties I did not find the spinach dish as good as the other ones.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It still tastes Ok, and it's still easy to prepare/serve. However the general green soupy substance is not as delicious as other offerings. Additionally the semi-solid floating parts - which are supposed to be cheese, but I think they're tofu - do not add an interesting flavor to the mix.<br /><br />If this was the only Kitchens of India product, or I liked spinach soup more (I do like spinach, but not in this style), I'd recommend it. Currently I'd recommend a more regular dish, or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GQ6OEM"">variety mix</a> to find your own taste."
"I had a balance left on my gift card and saw that the jerky was on sale.  So I bought a couple of cases.  This stuff was extra salty, too salty.  Something must have been wrong with the batch.  You could actually see the salt on the jerky.  Had to throw it away."
I order four of Natural Calm and I receive one only I have been calling regarding this order and I have no sollution to this situation. I hope they send me the rest of my order.<br /><br />thanks.<br /><br />Maria Irene Reyes
"I received a free sample of this tea online and now I want more!  Cherry Marzipan is smooth, sweet, rich and delicious.  I plan to order some for Christmas gifts."
"Our three-year-old should probably be writing this review since he can never get enough of these twisted takes on fruit ropes.<br />The Clif Bar folks have taken organic apple and apple juice puree, mixed in a natural strawberry flavor and come up with a healthier version of Red Vines or Twizzlers that packs an intense fruit flavor.<br />Each chewy piece contains one serving of fruit and there are no artifical colors.<br />The pectin leaves a bit of a waxy coating on your lips that feels not unlike lip balm--it would probably be a bonus in the cold, winter months."
"Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal."
I would say this is the best tasting popcorn  have eaten.  It to me is better than movie thearte popcorn.  It has the right mixed of salt and oil to give it a really good flavor
"Well if you have read some of my other reviews, you know I have not always had good luck with my Amazon food / candy purchases. I decided to roll the dice & try again. I have *great* news to share!  This time was a winner for me.<br />First the price. My local stores wanted on average $2.61 per bag for the same size bag that Amazon was selling for (I think I am doing the math right in my head) for $0.94 a bag on average (Amazon was selling in a quantity of 6 bag bundles). So I was able to make some fatter Easter baskets for a smaller price.<br />Second the weather. I took a chance with two day shipping after I consulted with a weather site & discovered that there was going to be a drop in the temperature outside. This year it seems we are jumping right over spring & headed for an early summer. When I noticed it would be upper 50's for daytime high & upper 30's at night, well that was another deciding factor. Two day prime shipping would be just fine & no extra money needed for overnight & no worries about the chocolate getting too hot. As far as I know Amazon does not have any kind of cold shipping for perishables (or maybe I just have not seen cold shipping because I have not bought anything Amazon uses that kind of shipping on). It seems I was luckier than some folks that had the unfortunate experience of receiving melted chocolate candy.<br />Third great thing  Items were well packed with air bubbles to keep them from breaking.<br />Finally the last thing. TASTE & FRESHNESS<br />Yay!  They were really great this time with nine months in the future before expiration!<br />Tasty.<br />I really wanted to post a positive review because I took the time to write & complain on a couple of previous reviews about dissatisfaction with my food purchases.<br />It seems these days that when we are unhappy we take the time to write negative reviews & complain about our dissatisfaction.  However, we often times forget to give a business or individual a compliment when we receive good service.  Thanks Amazon for making my Easter basket $$$ go further this year with the great prices & for getting my items so quickly to me!!"
"I eat these snaps by the pound, everyday, all day.  Anything ginger tastes good to me.  I'm signing up for the auto-ship, otherwise I'd make umpteen trips to the store.  Finding a cookie with unsulphured molasses is difficult & a requirement for me - I'm anaphylactic to sulphur.<br />My husband is now munching them too, so I'll have to double my order!<br />Thanks Mi-Del!  :)<br />Kristina"
"Bitter has made an intense comeback onto the craft-cocktail scene at bars and restaurants, and amazon is making it super easy to create your own craft cocktail at home by offering almost the entire Fee Brothers line of bitters.  Fee Brothers has always been our bitter manufacturer of choice and we were super excited to see amazon offering it at such an amazing price.  This flavor, Peach, has been pushed to the front of the line at our bar since we have been playing around with some fun southern cocktails... is there anything more southern than a Georgia Peach?<br /><br />A+ on Value, Shipping and Quality."
"I first fretted that we would not receive the flowers for Mother's day. We received them today and I wish we had not been so fortunate. The flowers are absolutely disgusting to the point my wife threw them at me when I walked in the door. The roses were brown alround the base pink and the foilage was all brown and quite dead. The baby's breath was also dead on arrival. I have never been so disgusted in my life and I will be paying for this for a long time. Speaking of paying I would have been far better off going to a local florist or even a super market.<br /><br />I have been buying from Amazon for years but this ends it. Please be so kind to remove my name from your rolls. I will do my very best to talk 10 persons a day to stay away from Amazon and a 100 persons a day to stay away from ""PRO FLOWERS"".<br /><br />John W. Hall"
Perhaps I should have known when I read caramel but I found this item too sweet for my tastes. Nor do I remember reading that it is an instant not a brew product. A lot like International Coffee without the ability to adjust the flavor.<br />Taking it off my S&S list.
Thia batter was okay. There are better recipes online and you can also mix in some of your own ingredeints. Its only cooking and if they come out tasting bad just take them to work and have your coworkers eat them.
"These cookies have a nice wafer with a marshmallow on it covered by a semi-sweet dark chocolate.<br /><br />All of the ingredients are fresh and they are excellent.  The cookie is not too sweet- just right.  The product packaging says that these have been around since 1913.  I, of course, have no way to judge what they were like but then, but I can't believe they weren't great.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the product, as was my family."
"Hey, we all got to cheat on our diets sometimes.  Sometimes, I find them a bit too filling, so I will only eat half of one. However, those with a large appetite will surely love how filling they can be. It is almost hard to believe how good these taste. I was cynical when I read the ingredient list compared to the other reviews. 20g of protein, sugar free yet tasty? All I can say is that all the positive reviews are correct. They are really yummy yet have a great nutritional value. I keep a bunch in my office at work, and will use them to snack on mid-afternoon to keep my energy and focus up. Admittedly, sometimes, I will eat two."
"I have always loved ghee with everything I prepare and eat - be it my daily dose of rice and sambar/curry, dosas and idlys or any sweet.<br /><br />I had a tough time getting used to life without ghee when I first came to the US and tried my hand at making ghee using butter. The result was not very commendable....<br /><br />It is then I came across Tazaa ghee.... the first time I tasted it, it reminded me of my home made ghee back in India and since then I have been hooked.....I am a regular customer of Tazaa ghee on amazon.com for the last 2 years....<br /><br />Great product, affordable prize and the best online seller... the combination is irresistible!!!"
This tea is delicious. low in caffeine and is not at all bitter. Go for it. It is just wonderful.
"Hazelnut coffee, I will have to admit , is new to me.  This coffee has the taste of moth balls.  I could not recommend it unless you love that smell."
"Most 'herbal' teas I've tried always taste like warm Koolaid to me but this one is just perfect.  Given the price, I've tried to find other, less expensive options but haven't come across anything that comes close.  Having it shipped this way through Amazon *is* less expensive than going through Stash even though the packaging itself is listed as Stash.<br /><br />At any rate, give this a try if you like lemon because it really hits the spot."
"These are really delicious, however I bought them for way less $ at my local health food store!  I won't think I would buy them for this price!"
"Strong coffee is enjoyable to me, but Tully's Decaf French Roast has an acrid, burnt taste that I don't enjoy.  I can choke it down by adding lots of creamer. Timothy's Rainforest Expresso Decaf makes a strong cup with a smoother taste.  I understand that the French Roasts have a stronger taste. I've used Starbucks French Roast in the past in my drip coffee maker and was pleased with it.  This variety is almost undrinkable!"
"This has lots of flavor and is great that it is decaf.  i don't like drinking caffeine throughout the day.  I would recommend this as it's easy to carry with you in your purse, briefcase, or tote bag and it adds a lot of flavor to your water.  It only adds 5 calories though.  Great stuff."
"I have used this product for a couple year now and love it.  In fact, instead of mixing it with water, I mix it with my coffee in the morning and enjoy it more then the mocha's I was getting at well-known coffee places. I used to by this product at a couple stores who longer carry it, which was really frustrating. Being able to buy it online is great!"
"I bought these for my daughter because she tried them and wanted more but we didn't know where to get them nearby.  So I figured I'd just get a case and let everyone on the softball team have a bag.  Now everyone keeps asking for more.  They are surely a big hit!  However, personally, they aren't my favorite.  The sea salt and black pepper flavor are more to my taste."
"This is a great product if you re trying to avoid gluten. I like brown rice and that's probably why I like the taste of this vermicelli. The prep instruction could have been better, but otherwise the packaging was good. I found that soaking the noodles for about 15 minutes in warm water was best--giving them a softer texture. I may try parboiling them. These noodles work best with oriental seasonings and sauces. Obviously too delicate to stand up to heavy Italian sauces. I used Franks Sweet Pepper sauce with shrimp and oriental veggies and it was delicious!"
"Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert.<br /><br />When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal."
"i love this coffee, it's my favorite however it doesn't come in decaf and i can only drink so much caffine without the side effects. please come out with decaf, we love coffee too."
"This is a terrific treat. My dog loves them. They are a bit pricey, yet worth it as a special snack."
"I went to a breastfeeding class at the hospital where I delivered my son about 6 wks before his arrival in 2010.  Five years before I had nursed my twins, but had given up at 10 wks due to not making enough milk & being totally exhausted from trying to keep up with both of them.  I wanted to be more successful this round.  The lactation nurse covered a bunch of details in the class but she specifically talked about some of the things moms could do to increase or maintain their natural milk supply.  She recommended fenugreek as one of the supplements that could be used that worked for a many people & had essentially no side-effects (the only thing mentioned was that mom's & baby's urine might smell like maple syrup which doesn't seem like a deterant to me!). I started using fenugreek less than 12 hrs after the birth of our son & I used it until he was 12 months old because that is when I weaned him.  I typically took two capsules at bedtime but if there were times I felt like my production was down, I would take it more frequently throughout the day. I have recommended this product for several friends & family members who have decided to breastfeed & will continue to. I'm so thankful that the lactation nurse knew about this product!"
I had searched quite a bit for coffee syrup as none were available in any local stores.  I finally found Torani and this was my seconf order for it.  I enjoy it very much.  My only comment is I would rather have it a little thicker.
"There was a sale on Wild Ride Beef Jerky, so I decided to try it out. They did not have the flavors I wanted, but the original was good. Large strips of meat that actually looked like pieces of meat and not reformed into synthetic looking ones. Overall, I would buy from them again."
"WOW! I looked in all of the local grocery stores and didn't find this seasoned pepper. Got on Amazon and 'poof', there it was! I ordered half dozen and received them super fast with my prime membership. Thank you! I will reorder again."
"I love valrhona chocolate. My mother is from the town in France where they are made, so I grew up with it . I have lived in the US for 10 years now and used to buy them from the brand US online store with coupons found online. There, the bag is 2.2 lbs and is branded valrhona ( go there to see what i mean, i didn't take a picture of my last bag directly from them).<br />From this seller, the bag is 2 lbs. by the look of the package, the difference in weight and the look of the feves ( see my picture, they are not in the best shape), i am guessing this seller buys in bulk, real bulk (maybe 2nd choice feves even?) and then repackages.<br />All in all, the chocolates taste fantastic as i expect from Valrhona, but i admit i was expecting the brand package (and look of the feves). If you intend them for baking, absolutely no issue. If you intend them as treats next to your coffee, then they are not looking their best.<br />Don't get me wrong, for the price i paid (less than at Valrhona), i will buy again. Soon. And often. It's just that because i know what the brand package looks like, i was a little disappointed.<br />Caraibe is one of my favorites too. They have different ones, which i also buy :-), but this one is very versatile and can be enjoyed by all, including my 21 month baby girl."
"If you've never tasted quinoa, you might want to go get a bag of actual quinoa before you venture into quinoa flour--it smells like bitter squash, and tastes like filberts.<br /><br />However, if you know what kind of flour you are getting, this stuff is great.  I made quinoa arepas with it this morning, and I'm here to tell you this is actually gluten-free.<br /><br />Why that is such a big deal:  in 2007, Bob's Red Mill got a much bigger facility;  before that, they had only a wall separating the gluten-free from the gluten side, and a lot of flour in the air.  (There can be 10 ppm gluten in the air in a tortilla factory that makes wheat tortillas, for example.)<br /><br />A lot of celiacs used to complain about Bob.  No more.  Apparently, if their flour was made in the newer, post-2006 facility, it's a lot more gluten-free.<br /><br />Good stuff guys.  Congratulations."
"I think Amazon is the best on line shopping place , there is. It has quality fast shipping and great service. Thanks Amazon, keep it up.I wouldnt get my coffee pods any where else."
"this is a wonderful candy, any time of year. Cool mint, creamy white chocolate. Individually wrapped, one big bag has like 28 pieces. Sadly, when I open a bag, I usually eat about half of it. :/ No wheat ingredients listed, but not listed as gluten free."
"I enjoy snacking on these saltines. They're  also good with sardines, cheese spreads and peanut butter."
"This tea isn't quite as full bodied as some other Assams but still has a great flavor. The quality is good: the leaves are small tips and there is very little tea ""dust"" or stems in the bag.<br /><br />I have blended this 1:1 with Stash's Organic Ceylon for an easy drinking English-style tea."
"I went through a spree of buying some pantry items off Amazon, and out of all of them, these boxes of quaker oatmeal were the best. Open two packs, put a little milk in to taste, and microwave for two minutes; you now go yourself a hot breakfast that tastes great. My Dad and I used to eat this camping all the time, and it really brings me back to those days. I highly recommend you buy this for not only the convenience of online shopping, but for the great flavor of rolled oats, raisins, and dates!"
"I have purchased K-Cups of Tully's Coffee previously but not the Breakfast Blend. For some reason almost all of the K-Cups in this Pack of 2 purchase I made have had grounds coming out in my coffee mug! I notice that when the cups are pierced the seal is not tight enough to prevent an opening at the rim, thus the fine coffee dust and also some grounds are escaping. Not very happy with this so I am not sure I will buy any more of this particular brand."
"We eat a lot of basmati rice and the Royal brand is our favorite.  It has a superior flavor and aroma over the other basmatis we've tried, and the grains cook up so much nicer and fluffier.<br /><br />To truly appreciate this fine rice, I would highly recommend following the directions to rinse the rice first.  It DOES make a difference."
"My Boston Terrier Max loves the Plato Organic Chicken treats, his favorite actually. When I first gave him one of the Sweet Potato treats he wasn't sure what to think. He was thrown off by the texture I think and was having trouble chewing it. After he finally ate the first one he was sniffing around the garbage where we had put one he had left on the floor. He was trying to get the treat that was in there. Now everytime we break them out that's all he wants. Along with the Organic Chicken treats. He's hooked."
"Bought this to ship overseas to a long time cheese head. It looked like a good deal and liked the variety. When I received it though, I was surprised. The size of each cheese sample is only 2 oz and about 2-3 bites for someone. The sausages are only 5 oz each. About 4-5 bites. I then noticed something that was disconcerting and that was each cheese sample is labeled ""Pasteurized Process Cheese Food""!!!<br /><br />There is no self respecting cheese head that would eat cheese food in lieu of the real thing!<br /><br />Try something else"
"I became familiar with this product when I lived in Switzerland. I use it primarily when making vinegarette salad dressing, but it is also wonderful for white sauce-based dishes, and any vegetable in place of salt."
"My dogs go nuts when they see the package..  They absolutely love these bones.  Both my dogs are large and the small/medium size is the perfect size for them.  The large size was too big.  One dog, an older dog, couldn't bite into it- it was just too large.  A good price and prompt delivery"
"These are not premium ingredients, glutens are not something I feed my dogs, and the poultry is not one of the first ingredients...I'll stick with pizzles, tendons, raw bones...that actually do clean teeth.<br /><br />Everlasting Treat Ingredients: Wheat Gluten, Gelatine, Water, Glycerin, Poultry Meat and Bone Meal, Natural Flavoring, Corn Gluten Meal, Garlic Powder, Brewer's Yeast, Lecithin, Sodium Diacetate, Vegetable Gum, Titanium Dioxide, and Natural Coloring."
"I drink a lot of tea... from the dollar store plain black tea to exotic loose leaf.  I have so much tea that I've been placed on a ""tea diet"" and have to sneak new teas into the house.  Needless to say, I was thrilled to try this new tea.<br /><br />Sadly, this tea fell very short.  I dont expect bagged chai tea to taste like real chai.  I do expect a nice spiced tea with a little bit of a kick.  I found this tea very weak.  Even leaving the tea in my 8 oz tea cup for 10 mins, the tea was still too weak.  I found the only way to drink this tea was to double up on the tea bags.  At 20 bags per box, this box would only last me 5 days with my 16 oz ""morning commute"" tea cup.<br /><br />On the plus side, this tea does smell nice.  I'm currently mixing it with no name cheap black tea with good results.  However it is likely that I will not purchase this tea in the future."
"This is the best of the best in my opinion, and reasonably priced. You can expect to spend nearly twice the cost of this product to get something similar at the retail ""Whole Foods"" Market. On many alternative medicine sites research has been quoted showing the marvelous healing benefits of this honey. One of the benefits quoted is the ability of certain raw honey, such as this one, to be placed on a very bad burn and the burn will heal without ever leaving a scar. What do we know of in allopathic ""modern medicine"" that can do that without horrendous and most often debilitating or life threatening side effects."
"Martinson's Dark Roast k-cup was a very nice surprise. My only complaint was that it came in a 48-count box. I had never tried this brand and bought it based on other reviewer's comments. Now that I know how good this coffee is, the larger box is not a problem. I prefer a full bodied cup of coffee in the morning and this brew met my needs and is one of my favorites. It is not over-powering, just very good.  I shared this coffee with two friends that have Keurigs and they liked it but said they couldn't find it at the store.  I would definitely buy this again."
"Ever since birth, my now 2-month old son is a very aggressive eater, and there are times of the day I could not breastfeed him exclusively without this tea. I've been drinking 1-2 cups per day for the past 6 weeks, and it helps to keep my supply up. I did make the ""mistake"" of drinking my first 1/2 cup just before bed the first time I tried it. I had been having supply issues during the evening, and after that 1/2 cup of tea I was so engorged all night I had more than enough to feed him and had to pump in between feedings to relieve pressure. The taste really isn't bad, it's good with honey or even with sugar if you must have your tea super-sweet. I'm usually really skeptical about natural remedies, it was a pleasant surprise to see it work as advertised."
very very terrible taste. The worst coffee I have ever tried. I am going to throw all these away. waste of money. Don't buy this product!
"The ""Nuts to Go"" package is very convenient and somewhat healthy, however, the ratio of Peanuts is too high compared with the other varieties in the package. Also peanuts are a ""Legume"". It would be nice to have more of the other varieties of ""nuts."""
Awesome value for the money. Ordred a second one at the end of the summer and still have not opened it. Tastes as good as some of the more popular brands.
I just purchased this product for the first time to help prevent constipation. I am very pleased with the product and it has helped to keep me regular. I started with the lowest dosage and it has worked for me.
If you like really sweet jerky than this is for you. I didn't like it. I thought it was really expensive.
"I have four cats which live in my home and I also feed one feral cat who lives outside. Though the feral has been eating at my house for 10 years, he still runs away whenever I come out the door. BUT, he does return once the food is left for him.<br /><br />My inside kitties are pretty spoiled and eat mostly Pro Plan and Fancy Feast, but for my feral guy (whom I had Trapped, Neutered, and Returned to me) Nine Lives and Friskies are his daily fare.<br />He really, really likes this Flaked Tuna with Cheese bits in sauce. He is also an aficianado of other of their varieties, but this one with the cheese is one of his favorites.<br /><br />I, like most cat people, have a regimen for feeding of the felines. At 5:00 PM, my inside kitties get their wet food. They have dry food available all day, but as the days winds down, it is time for the wet stuff. I give them six, three ounce cans of various varieties of Pro Plan and Fancy Feast with the feeding station being set up in the master bath.<br /><br />Clever creatures that they are, they soon learned that I then headed to the kitchen where I prepared dinner for Feral Kitty. They found that if they whined and begged, I would give them an additional can of food just to shut them up, so that I could get Feral Kitty's dinner to him. He gets two 5.5 ounce cans plus dry food.<br /><br />One day I decided to quit putting the expensive stuff out in the kitchen for my inside guys. It was getting out of hand expense wise. So, I plopped down Flaked Tuna and Cheese, went and fed Feral Kitty and then was on my way. The next day I noticed that the little inside guys had eaten ALL the 9 Lives I had given them. It was a big AHA for me. They are not so picky as I thought. They took like this Tuna with cheese. For a long time, I bouught them Albacore tuna when it went on sale at the grocery store for 10 for $10. They got tired of it. But, the would eat the 9 lives. I was astounded. So, I have kept my Feral Kitty quite happy with his favorite Tuna with cheese. Plus, I am now saving a bit by giving the more inexpensive 9 lives to the inside kitters. Everyone likes it!!<br /><br />So, Flaked Tuna with cheese comes highly recommended by Trinity, Gabriella, Wisdom, Mercy, and FERAL KITTY....and me. Hope your less choosy, or tired of the rich stuff, cats will enjoy this alone with mine!"
"I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!"
"I'll admit it, I am a bit of a Starbucks addict. I love my Caramel Macchiatos and a flavored latte is just the perfect coffee drink for pretty much any day. So when I saw this product I decided to try it, hoping to be able to satisfy my craving for a daily vanilla latte also on the days when a trip to midtown would involve a major detour.<br />I wasn't disappointed - a heaping tablespoon of this coffee in my French press, steeped for about 8 minutes, delivered a drink that with just a little milk and sugar was a pretty satisfying substitute for a vanilla latte, that was also a hit with my equally Starbucks addicted brother-in-law at a brunch.<br /><br />I'd recommend it.<br /><br />(Note: I only received one pack, not two.)"
I was so hoping that Starbucks would come out with a mild blend for k cups. Starbucks has exceeded my hopes. This coffee is delicious. THANKS STARBUCKS
I like this stuff because it doesn't taste awful and it has the equivalent effect on my body that fiber powder would have on most people. I do feel more calm and sleepy however I Can't sleep when I take it. So if I take it in the am I'm tired but if I take it in pm I can't sleep. I also get cramps because its doing something to my digestive system.
"I didnt think these chips would be that special, but I am game for anything once. Man was I pleasantly suprised, these chips are addicting and now I am hoarding them from the family, (not really) but the thought has crossed my mind.  DELICIOUS!!!"
THIS COFFEE IS AWESOME THE BEST I HAVE EVER BOUGHT IN 4 YRS ON AMAZON!! IT CUPS WELL THE BEANS ARE FRESH AND IT IS A TRUE CITY ROAST
"I bought this for its lack of sugar and sodium.  It has good flavor and a crisp crunch, even after sitting in milk for a while.  Huge plus is all the fiber you get in just one serving and it is low calorie.  Wonderful for someone who must watch their sugar and sodium intake.  Will buy again and again!  My kids even like snacking on it, I have replaced sugary cereal with this and they have no complaints."
"I received 8 bags of Starburst quite a while before Halloween thinking I would be generous and give out handfuls of wrapped Starbursts!  So I saved, from each bag, the flavors that werent my favorites and gobbled up the red and pink ones first---put away the other flavors. But as my favs slowly (nah--quickly disappeared) I made my way downthe flavor choices! I was really happy that there werent a lot of kids ringing my bell on Halloween!"
"this coffee comes in bags, not containers. very annoying. also it looks different than regular maxwell house, the coffee crystals look like tasters choice, and it says freeze dried coffee on the bag, which it doesnt say on regular maxwell house"
"These organic pouches sell out FAST at the store, and with good reason! We love these fruit pouches-- they are portable, sized perfectly for kiddo hands, and offer a perfect, wholesome snack. Ingredients are organics and gives a healthy dose of omega-3. All organic with 100% natural ingredients, no pesticides, no chemical fertilizers, no genetic modifications, and no preservatives. The pouches themselves are are BPA and phthalate free.<br /><br />Compare the ingredient list on these snacks to the other fruit pouches and you will quickly see why these are so popular:<br />Contains: Organic Banana, Organic Peach, Organic Mango, Salba<br /><br />That's it! Simple, pure, and healthy."
I have ordered these several times and they are supplying in one nut- 100% of your requirement of selenium a day!  I eat one and sometimes 2 a day. I even give one to my great dane a few times a week to keep him healthy. They taste good so a nice snack for me is a Brazil nut and a few walnuts daily. Helps m lose weight also because its ba healthy snack not a sugary high calorie one. I have not craved junk food and high calorie sweets.
This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I'm 30 now and I love it!
There is nothing quite like this fruit paste roll.  If you are a fan of apricot then this is for you. It is a healthy and delicious treat. Seller sent super fast.
"Very yummy, a must to have on hand for a great G/F snack on the go. I have this every night as my bed time snack."
"As others have noted, these treats are made in China as clearly stated on the bag. I didn't like that, but the news gets worse.<br /><br />On the back of the bag is a statement: ""Not for human consumption. Wash hands with soap and water after handling.""<br /><br />If I have to wash my hands after handling these things, I'm sure as hell not going to feed them to my Yorkies!<br /><br />As expected, Amazon graciously accepted a return."
"My mother's favorite flavor is Chocolate, mine being Butterscotch. These lollypops are extremely delicious and they last for quite a while. The shape of the lollypops are unique and they are as savory as I can remember. I highly enjoy all products from Sees candies, the only downside is they can't ship you a sample chocolate like they give at the store!<br /><br />Quality products, quality service, quality through and through."
"I have been ordering coffee from Amazon forever and never received them loose in a brown paper bag! many seem like they are about to explode--and I see an expiration date of October, 2012 on the bottom of the bag.No info on calories, carbs, etc--very Disappointing. I feel I have been had!!"
"****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br />****"
These soy nuts are the perfect snack.  Just the right amount of sea salt and satisfying.  I also love that they are organic and not made from GMO soybeans.
Didnt taste flat as I expected it to. Good flavor. Wish had sent more than one can though! Nice change of pace from just drinking soda beverage. No added sugar either.
I received a bread machine as a gift and wanted to try out this rye bread. Never used a bread machine before I just followed the directions. Three hours later a perfect loaf on my first try! Needless to say it didn't last to long as a few friends happened to come by just as it was finished baking. If you enjoy rye bread this is a great one.
"...But when you don't have a Tim's nearby, this is pretty great! If I'm getting something at Tim Horton's, I tend to get the coffee, but I love their hot chocolate. When I'm making this at home, I put a little soy milk in with the mix because it makes it creamier and more like it is at the actual restaurant. I think it's the best hot chocolate mix out there."
"I was starting to get bummed about my fancy Kuerig machine because I was getting tired of the cost of K-cups all the time...it adds up!  Especially with shipping!  I tried these just the one time to give it a whirl, and I say, they are so delicious.  I do the monthly renewal for $13 (I think?), it is so inexpensive.  I am a starbucks addict and my husband is very picky about his coffee (we live in Seattle - that should say alot lol)  These look different that K-cups being the bottom is open and not a plastic cup, but it brews perfectly.  The only thing is I no longer use my kcup carousel because since the bottom is open to air and not the cup you dont want them getting stale, so I went and purchased an air tight container for the counter top. NBD tho.  Hope you try them! You will be happy!"
"Started ordering this with the subscribe and save option, prices used to be $12.81, then they're $15.73, and now it appears to have went up to $17."
"The tea leaves arrived in perfect condition with clear instructions for use.  I've made and drank two batches of the tea ( each makes four 8-oz cups) and I assume all the health-giving properties are doing their thing!  The tea itself is bland and pretty tasteless.  I drink it icy cold and it's like drinking water - no better, no worse.  People can add sweetener and drink it hot or warm also, but I just drink it in place of one of my usual water beverages because that is what I prefer.  It's a health drink and I can't imagine anyone disliking it, and that's the main thing.  You don't have to hold your nose and choke it down.  It's fine."
"I'm a cyclist, personal trainer, registered nurse and avid health nut, and I fully endorse these products :) Seriously, they are not only good tasting but follow all the criteria for a healthful snack -- not processes, raw ingredients, not a lot of sugar."
This hot chocolate has a great hazelnut flavor.  It is not a gritty powder mix.  It seems to make a creamy cup of cocoa.  I recommend it.
"We enjoy the 3 Kcups we received:  Hazelnut, French Vanilla, and Caramel Cream.  The special for the 3 was especially welcomed."
"I have only had this once as banana pancakes so I'm not sure how it tastes without fruit, but it was the best pancake I've had in a long time.  Thank you for making a Gluten Free Bisquick, I will try biscuits with it next!"
"Don't buy this if you like Starbuck's coffee.  I love this because it is mild.  In the past, I bought Green Mountain coffee, but I always added water to dilute its taste.  This is a perfect mild taste.  K-cups are expensive, but these taste good, so it's worth the cost."
"This maple syrup is very nice.  It is not too sweet, has a good maple flavor, and, to my knowledge, no added sugar or HFCS.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed by this, nor the price - I paid around $18 for a 32ounce jug."
I bought the vanilla bean extract but I was very disappointed to find that it has a stronger alcoholic flavour to it than the actual vanilla flavour. The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract.
"I actually bought these at a local natural/health food market. They were insanely expensive and I wish I would have tried amazon first! Still, I LOVE these cookies, I got the EXTREME chocolate mini cookies and they're delicious! Even my kids like them and they can be fairly picky. They're loving getting to try all of my ""new gluten-free things!"", and I may be moving them gluten-free as well.<br /><br />These cookies have a wonderful flavor, texture, and crunch. I find myself happy with just 2-4 of them, instead of just wanting to devour the entire package considering the small size of the cookies. Size wise they remind me of the chocolate chip cookies you can get in that mixed pack of grandma cookies? I think that's what they are, they have the frosted animal cookies, and those chocolate chip ones. Anyway, they're smaller cookies, good flavor, good crunch, gluten-free and great price here at amazon. What more can you really ask for anymore? ;)"
I bought this for a family gathering where one person needed gluten free food.  The taste was no different than regular lasagne noodles and no one noticed a difference!  The noodles were very good!!
"I love sweet and sour candies, so I decided to give these a try. My initial impression is that they don't put a lot of the candy in each box, but I guess that's pretty typical. The candies look good but were pretty stuck together in the bag. No biggie. When I first tried these, my thoughts were that the candy has a nice little sour taste to them when you first put them in your mouth, then the sour goes away pretty fast (within 5 seconds or so). I would have preferred that they have more sourness to them, but that's ok. The flavor is good and is a nice mix between strawberry and watermelon. The texture is more spongy or chewy than a candy like Sour Punch Kids. These ""Bits"" are not gummy like those.<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste, wish there was more sour, and the texture is pretty good. Not my favorite but definitely still good!"
"Our Boxers were super excited to have these bones. They ate the whole thing, the bones didn't upset their stomachs. We will definintely buy these again."
"I have a Waring Pro popcorn maker.  This is like a minature movie type popcorn maker.  I purchase this great n popcorn 4 oz packs.  When used 1/4 of corn kernels of packets don't pop. I tried longer times , still the same result."
"This was such a great gift find! Truly unique and my parents are still excited over it! (even though I gave it to them on Christmas)...they spent the whole day rummaging through the vintage candy and saying, ""Ooooh remember these??"" It was awesome and made me so happy to see them excited.<br /><br />Delivery was prompt but price was a little high...however, for the joy it brought, I'd say it was pretty well worth it. =)"
"This is a very tasty snack from the peanut experts-- planters.  Only 220 calories per bar and loaded with protean.  They taste very good, I will buy again."
"It was a little drier than when I first tasted this.<br />Maybe past its prime.<br /><br />Flavor was fine though, I like this minty dark chocolate-ness.<br />Like a healthy Girl Scout Thin Mint>"
"I've been using this hot sauce for years as part of my collection of sauces.  If you are looking for a strong vinegar based hot sauce this is not it.  But if you are looking for a sweet-n-hot sauce, this is perfect.  I've never been fond of the way most of the hot sauces are dominated by an overpowering vinegar tart.  They have their place, but as a straight sauce on most foods, by the time you have the food warm to the taste, there may be little taste of the food left.<br /><br />I've found this sauce a delightful departure from ketchups and other similar condiments, used right on fresh foods including just plain rice."
This coffee is really enjoyable to drink.  I love it in the morning or in the evening with desert.  I would definitely buy this again.  Great deal for the price.
"I've been a subscribe and save purchaser of this Nerds item for almost a year and this last batch is just awful, sour and bitter. Not sure if it is spoiled/old or what, but I'm probably going to end up tossing out most of it. Too bad, but I guess better in the long run not to munch on candy daily, anyways!"
"I have tried so many peach teas that were either bitter, pale, or off tasting.  This is hands-down my favorite peach tea.  It makes the most amazing iced-tea in the summer.  It is robust enough to handle being served iced and is sweet enough to require minimal or no sweetners.  A very refreshing tea!"
My dog loves this crunchy treat. It is like a chew treat so it lasts longer.
"Absolutely love these chips, have introduced them to many of my friends. First time I tried them was the large bag and I ate the whole thing."
"This flour tastes great, but doesn't seem to have the best result when used by itself.  I had high hopes after reading the reviews and my first attempt - pie crust - was a flop...the dough wouldn't stay together to even think about rolling it out...so I patted it into the pan and it tasted good - just crumbled.  I then tried it in crepes and added xanthum gum and it seemed better, but still not great.  My best success with it has been using 1/2 this and 1/2 Bob's red mill GF baking flour, along with some xanthum gum.  The results are terrific - great taste and texture!!"
I have been a fan of most of Newman's products.  This one I would consider average.  Maybe I was expecting too much from a medium roast.  It is worth a try and I would purchase again.  Then I'll rotate my daily ingestion with some other blends so as not to get bored.
"The packaging was nice and it was a great idea, but the bubble gum was really hard. I really wish the gum was fresh, if that were the case I might of actually been able to get people to take them home."
"Being a native Texan and Wolf Brand being a Texas product, I had eaten Wolf Brand for many years. After moving to Utah a few years ago, I had tried every brand of chili available in the stores here, only to find that none of them is as tasty as Wolf's. In addition, all the brands available here are with beans. I like beans but I like my chili pure, without beans. Then I tried my hand at home made chili. My home made is good but no amount of tinkering with the recipe produced chili equal to Wolf Brand. When I found Wolf's No Beans at Amazon, I ordered a case (24 cans). The chili arrived in perfect condition (no dented cans)and I am once again enjoying my favorite chili."
"I have been looking everywhere for olive oil and rosemary potato chips since my local Italian grocer stopped carrying them. Was so surprised when I accidentally ran across them at Amazon and haven't been able to stop eating them since they arrived. These are the best chips I think I have ever had--fresh, crunchy, lightly flavored with rosemary, and best of all--made with heart healthy olive oil. I know that olive oil doesn't outweight the negative of eating these chips---but who cares--they're awesome!"
"I bought this for my dog that has a yeast infection. I have used it on his skin and feed it to him. He loves it. It has a great smell and is a great value for the amount you get and that it is organic. I don't like the plastic container, but other than that it is a great product."
"I've been an avid ZICO drinker for over a year, sticking mainly to my fav pineapple.  I wasn't sure how Chocolate could go with a coconut water, but i am sooooo impressed and glad i tried it.  It's not necessarily the ZICO flavor i grab after a workout, as i still love pineapple (though chocolate is great in my morning recovery smoothie), but it has definitely replaced my mid-afternoon snacking habit in a much healthier way.  Best of all - i've got the whole house hooked on it, so my kids now choose healthy hydration instead of the artificial and high calorie stuff they used to drink.  i'm sold."
"Love Vita Coco - drink them 2x a day for years now - and love the Rihanna connection - but the taste of these is not growing on me. Oh well I'm just a city boy who's sick & tired of ""sports"" drinks with added sugar, no vitamins and made from concentrate. What do I know? Anyway I prefer the plain, peach/melon and tangerine, but will probably skip the Tropical in the future."
"After researching dog foods, I went with Wellness core and my little dog loves it!! I feed Wellness core and put 1/2 can of the canned in with it and am so pleased that my dog begs for ""mealtime""."
"I just had to write a review for the Greenies Pill Pockets.  Genius!  My older dog has to take 3 pills, 3x/day.  He quickly picked up on the hiding them in cheese, bread, etc., tricks. Pill giving became a time-consuming, frustrating ordeal.  Most of the time I would think I had hidden his medication well in his food, only to find them spit out on the floor.  My vet recommended the pill pockets - just the right texture and consistency to fit the 3 pills in at once.  Love how you can shape them right over the pills and pinch the top and voila' - done deal! He must love the taste because he gobbles it up every time.  You also get a decent quantity in each bag. I will use these from now on for sure.  Thanks, Greenies!"
"bought for the best little gal I ever had the pleasure of knowing..  TAZ..  she had never seen these, we had them when I was young, so I figured she'd get a kick out of them..  she loved them, and of course so did her brother, who got into them and ate every one of them... so... I bought her more..  along with the wax lips, wax fangs..  all those old timey things that kids now days haven't seen or heard of.. she gets a charge out of the good ol' stuff..  great quality, just like the old days ..."
"I drink my coffee black and prefer the bolder, stronger k-cups.  I don't like the french roasts or the other dark roasts, but I do like my coffee strong.  After having tried many different extra bolds, Coffee People's Black Tiger and Gloria Jean's Black Gold have become my favorites.  I alternate between the two of them and sprinkle in Green Mountain's Sumatran Reserve now and then which is also very good."
"To say this organic, low sugar, filled with a ba-jillion good things, it really tastes quite good! I got it on sale to try it out. Vanilla was very tasty. Not sure I would buy again though mainly for the price. But I would definitely recommend it!"
"I add a serving of PB2 to non-fat yogurt for a protein boost, use it to make a lower fat Thai-style peanut hot sauce, and add it to desserts.  If I bothered to read recipes, there would be more delicious and healthy uses.  We're going through our second case.  It is much more economical to buy by the case."
"My cat just love them, chomping down the kibbles which are a bit on the smaller size. My cat has started to gain weight & muscle back, and I am very happy with the results. I also add 1/4 cup of NON salted chicken soup with the food. I'll be doing another blood test in 6 months. Will do future update.<br /><br />My cat has high BUN and creatinnine blood level, and vet recommended changing food. Chose ""Now! Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats, Grain Free Turkey with Duck"" because it has the lowest phosphorous dry adult cat food I can find, without going the prescription food route. The phosphorous level is 0.65% dry matter, considered to be on the low but acceptable side. Their protein quality is high, grain free and acceptable fat level. Most other non-prescription dry kibbles phosphorous range from 0.65% to 3%. Only prescription food can have lower than 0.5%. Phosphorous is important to health, but must be on lower range for pets with kidney problem.<br /><br />Food is a bit higher in price, but very well worth the results. I now have a normal weight masculine happy active cat :-) ... woo hoo!!! MEOW!!! =>o&lt;="
"i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best.  now, i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product."
"I tried this product about 2 years ago and it was just like movie theatre popcorn at that time but since that time, they must have changed the product and now tastes more like a microwave popcorn that lacks flavor.  The packaging has changed to include a separate salt/butter flavor compartment and the oil is now a liquid instead of a solid. Very disappointed in this product and sadly I now have 23 packets remaining."
I can not get this product where I live so I always order this from Taylors Market! Awesome service!!! THANKS!!!!!!!
"I have been a long time fan of this product.  ""Trader Joes"" used to sell SnackMasters Turkey Jerky in their stores but replaced it (much to my disappointment!) with their own inferior product.<br />I do find the quality of the turkey jerky better in the larger 3.5 ounce size.  I have found the product in the smaller size bags to be hard and less fresh.<br />Other wise I love the stuff....."
"I was not sure this product would live up to the ads, but it gave me the energy boost I needed when I needed it when I had to work the overnight shift."
"I have to admit, the dogs do like it!  I think this is similar to the kids liking fast food vs a home cooked meal. The ingredients are all the healthiest for your pet, but they do eat it! I know that we try to stick to Iams, but decided to give this a try. The dogs couldn't eat it any faster than they did! They loved it!  I would make it the occassional purchase to perhaps mix in with my dogs normal food."
This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.
"I tasted this pears long ago and had never forgot them. I happened to see them in Amazon. Bought a few cans, not cheap, but worth the price. Really good if you like pears."
"My co-worker said these crackers look like bird food, LOL. I bought the cranberry and hazelnut version from Whole Foods.<br /><br />They are perfectly crunchy and have just the right amount of sweetness; you can really taste the hazelnut. They are on the pricey side so I probably won't purchase them on a regular basis."
Mary is no slacker when it comes to crackers! These crackers are so delicious they can be served at cocktail parties or even to the men at their weekly poker gathering.  The gluten sensitive can munch to their heart's delight and no one need know their dietary secrets. There is something about Mary - she knows how to make a cracker that anyone will like!
"I mostly drink regular non flavored coffees....but since buying the Keurig I have grown fond of flavored coffees as a dessert or afternoon pick me up. This Island Coconut is by far one of my favorite coffees to indulge in. The coconut taste is very realistic and fresh, and it makes a wonderful iced coffee treat.The only thing I wish was a little different is that it is a mild coffee and I believe the coconut could stand up to a bolder blend."
"The new Sweethearts are here.<br /><br />Yellow is now lemon instead of banana.<br /><br />Green is now apple instead of lime.<br /><br />There is no white heart.<br /><br />The pink one, formerly cherry, is now strawberry.<br /><br />The purple one almost tastes like the old one (medicine), but not exactly.<br /><br />There is a blue one and it tastes like chemicals.<br /><br />The taste for all of the flavors ranges from 'soap-like' to 'chemical-infused'.<br /><br />Why mess with a classic?  Nothing was wrong with the old flavors, but this new candy is too horrible to eat.  I could not finish the bag."
This is a repeat order...we enjoy the product a lot.  Delivery was quick as usual from Amazon.  Dave
"We started with fresh goats milk and after 2 weeks transitioned to this product.  I prepare it with warm water in the blender and add some strawberry flavoring.  My son (17 months) loves it.  Very easy to prepare, and compared to baby formula - VERY reasonable in price."
Great flavor for use as flavoring. Also works well in problem areas to assist with mice. We keep in in the RV and the problem with the little four legged critters has decreased greatly!
"Another great, nutritious breakfast cereal product from Nature's Path. I love variety in breakfast ready-to-eat cereal, and this one is included in my inventory of healthy organic cereals."
"I bought this product because of it's addition of chicory. The taste is smooth, not overly strong, making for a good anytime beverage. It's been added to my subscription list."
"I have sampled, tasted and stayed with many different types of protein bars until I found Honey Stinger Peanut Butta Pro Bars...Now, I will eat no other bar.  These are quite simply the BEST tasting...as another reviewer said, ""like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups"" only not as sweet, thankfully, and they satisfy my craving for chocolate.  I find that tasting real chocolate candy bars now are revolting. I will go a step further to say that I actually almost live on these bars...probably not the best idea, but at this time in my life, when real food from grocery stores, except for fruits, veggies, yogurt, soy milk, and a few other things, does not have a satisying or appealing taste for me, these bars are my sole source for protein.  I eat at least 2-3 a day, never get tired of the flavor, will drive out of my way to find them if I run out of my shipment before the next one arrives.  I feed these to my grandkids and they open their little mouths like birdies waiting for the next bite...great for a substitute for candy, plus it is nutritious, and as I said, my grandkids think they are the best, pure and simple.  As for the sugar content, I am not worried about it...mostly oganic honey and evaporated cane juice...better than sucrose in my book.  All I can say is, I believe in this product, will continue to use it every day and hope they NEVER change the formula...I don't think I could live without them."
My 8 month old loves these yogurt melts.  They are super easy to dissolve and taste amazing.  The fact that they are organic and support Project Peanut Butter in Africa is a plus.
Mysterious Lady Grey with outstanding flavor. Love the taste... a bit more aromatic than regular earl grey. It is very suiting and gentle tea. Love it!
"WE STARTED USING THESE CHEWS FOR OUR LAB PUPPIES.  SINCE THEY ARE NOT MADE FROM RAWHIDE THEY ARE TOTALLY DIGESTED AND IT REALLY, REALLY HELPS THEIR BREATH AND TEETH.  THE PUPS THINK THEY ARE GETTING A SPECIAL TREAT EACH TIME I PULL OUT THE BAG!"
"the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn."
"I wish i would have heed the warnings from other shoppers! I've NEVER left a product review before BUT I HAD TO FOR THIS ITEM...  I wasn't until the third day of giving these to my Bestest buddy that I realized they were not agreeing with him... I know, bad daddy..<br />Old Iron gut met his match. Price shouldn't really be an issue here - yeah they are cheap (never again) but Id like to know what they put in them to make them desirable because once its gone - illness sets in. ONLY BUY IF YOU WANT an ill looking & miserable pet. I am not even going to keep them around to send for a refund - bad bad bad.<br /><br />WARNING - TREAT AS POISON  *****  WARNING *** DO NOT FEED"
"I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />""...let's get together and feel all right""  Indeed."
For years my 13 year old son has refused to eat during a golf tournament and he is normally fatigued before the tournament end.  This is the first product that he remembers to include in his bag.  It seems to give him enough energy to finish the round without losing focus and he loves the taste!
"Gloria Jean's Coffees, Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig.  Tasted fine but was hoping for a bit more Hazelnut flavor.  In their defense I have found most K-Cups not to have a strong flavor like fresh brew coffee.  Product good, would buy again, but the flavor was not over the top."
"I love this product. I use it in my smoothies. It gives the smoothies a richer, creamier texture and taste. The other brands I have purchased locally were grainy and not as good as this one as well as twice the price of this prodcut! Thanks!"
"I have medium to long fine hair, and I have tried just about every shampoo on the market from 97 cent varieties to the big bucks salon versions.  Some are better than others, but I have to say that Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty's Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo is towards the top of my list.  It cleans well while leaving my hair shiny and my scalp well conditioned.  I have been using it along with the matching conditioner, and I love the way my hair looks and feels.  You might find something you like a little better but not at this price.  For $5 per bottle, you should give this a try.  You won't be disappointed!"
"I have a couple grand kids that had a flu bug.<br />They ate this cereal hrs before they got sick.<br />Just a note.....the flu was going around at that time, being sick had nothing to do with them eating this cereal.<br />Needless to say, their bottoms were stained with a bluish green color. How much food coloring are these kids eating?"
"I have a 10 yr old & a 7 yr old dog. The 10 yr old will eat anything, the 7 yr old is extremely picky & has a delicate stomach. We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food."
"McCann's is the best oatmeal on this planet! Amazon makes it easy to purchase at the best price because retail food stores normally charge $[...] a box. If you want to know the difference between the old standby ""rolled oats"" and McCann's Steel Cut oats go here [...]"
"This fruit and nut bar by KIND is very, very tasty.  Travels well, even in the heat.  No problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat.  Nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues ... otherwise, they are superb."
This product needs to be added directly to apple cider. This product only enhances apple cider it is not a drink itself.
Most wonderful tea - aroma is out of this world. It is a medium bodied tea which brings in all the health benefits of pure Green tea and naturally imparts fragrance and distinctive flavor of the Jasmine flower. The  triangular mesh bags allows large leaf teas to be used and to brew better. A great refreshing tea after a strong tasting or rich food.<br /><br />Great gift idea for tea lover!
My dogs loves these soft and stinky treats! They are great for training because they are small enough you can give a lot of  them and not be concerned about giving your dog to much food. They also have healthy ingredients and are one of the treats my sensetive GSD can have =0)
We have two barn cats that we can't touch. But each evening they visit our back porch to receive their cat treats.
"I gave this 3 stars because I do feel it is a quality food, but my dog got bored with it before he was finished with the first can. (two days)  The same thing happened with the chicken stew.  At first I thought maybe he just didn't want leftovers, so I opened another can...same thing.  He seemed to  love it at first, although I was still mixing in his Organix chicken and potatoes.  When it was all the chicken or beef stew, he would barely sniff it.  He would walk around his bowl like he was looking for the good stuff, which I gave him when I took the bowl of stew away.  Too bad, because it seemed like a nice chunky food that he would enjoy.  Not so much.  I know some people feel that ""they will eat it when they are hungry enough"".  I have never and will never make my pets eat like that.  I wouldn't like to, and I feel they are entitled to have likes and dislikes as well."
"I'm in the latter months of pregnancy and it is becoming harder and harder to get a good nights sleep. In lieu of not being able to find my go-to Chamomile at the grocery, I reached for Bedtime Story since in the tag line it expressed being Caffeine Free and made with Real Spearmint and Chamomile Flowers. I was curious what the Spearmint would be like with the Chamomile so I scooped Lipton Bedtime Story with plans to make a cup that night.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, I was hit with the tingly scent of Spearmint. I brewed a cup, curiously wondering if the tea would be more minty than I wanted. After letting it steep for a few minutes, I added my favorite accompaniments and sipped. Delicious. It's a soft, relaxing blend of Chamomile. The Spearmint is not overpowering like I had worried it might be. The ingredients listed are Spearmint Leaves, Chamomile Flowers, Peppermint Leaves, Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, Spice, Chicory Root. I would say that along with the Chamomile and Mint flavors, the Chicory Root, stands out a bit, giving the tea a hint of earthiness.<br /><br />Bedtime Story definitely relaxed my body and I've been sleeping like a baby (pun intended) ever since."
I drink at least two cups of tea a day and have tried hundreds of types.  After years of drinking black I have switched to green and white and now I would not go back.  The white is just much cleaner and does not give you an aftertaste.  The green I like to drink after dinner or a meal.  This gives me two of the teas I love in one package.  Now if my gf would stop drinking all of it I would be even more happier :)
"......for whatever reason, these are just too mushy.  I've gotten them from Amazon twice now and both times they've been like this.  They should be a little more aged or firm or whatever you want to call it.  It's hard to snap into a Slim Jim when it's mush.  I think I'll just stick to buying them in a store."
"As far as flavored teas go this is a rather nice blend with smooth yet bold vanilla spice taste.  It has a good bit of caffeine in it as a pick me up and can be a nice change for an afternoon cup of coffee.  Beyond the caffeine it also purports to be a healthier choice than many other energy drinks.  While I was not overwhelmed by this tea, as I tend to like heartier blends, I would give it a qualified thumbs up."
"My son is gluten/casein free and LOVES these pretzels.  I even know some friends who tried them and liked them so much- they want to buy some for themselves- and they aren't even on a G/C free diet.<br /><br />These bags are a great deal.  I compared all the sizes of the bags and prices on Amazon.<br /><br />If your child has food problems, buy a bag from the local health food store, try them out and then come back to Amazon and buy a case or two.  Definitely the best deal."
"I know I can get Asian sweet rice flour somewhat cheaper, and I've tried it.  It comes in boxes that don't reseal or in flimsy plastic bags that I find somewhat difficult to handle.  I find the Bob's Red Mill sweet rice worth the small difference in price.  I trust their products, and the bags are the same as those for their other GF flours - a nice size, and a shape that isn't difficult to handle - I can stand one up on the counter while measuring from it, and don't spill flour all over the place."
"I have loved coffee nearly all my life and really only drink GOOD coffee. That being said, when I tried WICKED WOLF at my brother's house in Alaska, I was hooked. Converted really. I have not been the same since. I now must have my Wicked Wolf! It is the very best coffee I have ever had and I've had a lot! Oh, and I absolutely love the packaging...hehe Ray Troll rocks! I'm stoked Amazon is carrying Raven's Brew!"
"Shadow won't touch most cat food and no ""people food"", but I saw the reviews and thought I would give Temptations a try.  Imagine my surprise when I found he LOVES them  -- he will even do tricks to get them!!"
"If you are someone who finds yourself going to Starbucks or Caribou much more often than you should, save yourself a lot of money and make it at home yourself!  I've tried them all, and can honestly tell you that this espresso is the best that you can get for the home barista.  It may seem expensive compared to the other brands that you can get, but nothing matches the rich dark espresso that you can make with illy.  I actually prefer home-made lattes with this coffee to anything I can buy in town."
"This coffee is our coffee crack whenever we are in Europe. Usually, we get lazy (or really are on the go) and go for the instant version (die-hard coffee aficionados need not reply), as it's pretty awesome coffee, as well.<br /><br />We have since run out of our favorite carte noire instant coffee jars that we brought back with us, creating quite of a coffee fix dilemma! Should we fork out $15 for 100 grams of instant coffee (same brand) or should we break out the coffee press and buy 2 8.8 oz packages (about 500 grams total) of ground coffee of the same brand for $20.<br /><br />We have since been using the coffee press almost daily. Great coffee, for almost the grocery store price."
"I generally make all of LO's food organic from scratch (yes, I work full-time, but this is important to me, so I make the time).  However, I've tried a few pre-packaged foods...and while LO loves the taste of Chick Chick, and I like that it is more well-rounded than most others, I absolutely hate this packaging.  If my little one decides he doesn't want to finish the package after three bites, the rest is total waste...or I have to scoop it into a different container to store until he's ready to finish.<br />Absolutely love the item, but hate the packaging."
GOOD SERVICE. I'D DEFINITELY RE-ORDER THIS.  HONEST FOLKS!  I GIVE THEM 4 STARS<br />MARCIA<br />SAN DIEGO
My small Westie terrier absolutely loves his Greenies! I had other Westies in the past years and these were also their favorite treat. The company was sold and they changed the formula years ago and made them safer for the dogs to eat. They are the BEST!
"This is a great inexpensive mix.  We use Lactaid brand milk to make ice cream for my lactose intolerant family members.  Fun and easy, with or without an ice cream maker!"
"It has a strong, but smooth taste. You don't have to use a lot to get a strong cup of coffee. I use to drink a brand of Starbucks I like this better."
"I love this protein snack bar. Tastes more like a candy bar than a protein bar and is easy to eat, easy to digest and a very quick & satisfying snack. I use it as a meal replacement or a fast way to stop my chocolate cravings. Love it."
"You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!)."
"I used to think these were basically ""potato crack"" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order."
"I tried it. It sucks. When I saw the package I thought ""butter"" ""garlic"" two of my favorite food groups. What could go wrong. BUT. The rice came out hard like it was undercooked. The flavor was the worst. The fake butter taste was nasty. It's like the stuff used in microwave popcorn but worse. Tasted like a bad mix of laundry chemicals. Nasty stuff. Stay away from it."
Stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time.
I love these coffee beans!  They have the right amount of flavor and strength for a great cup of coffee.  I use 3 scoops for eight cups.  The flavor is wonderful!
"Just wanted to let you know to go ahead and try this product. I was very hesitant based on the packaging reviews, but I went ahead and ordered mine and it was fine, unopened, just dusty like being in a warehouse. I will update you on the taste later..."
"The sugar free Pumpkin Pie  syrup is delicious. There is not a strong pumpkin flavor ...it's more of a spice flavor and would be great to drink all year, not just at the Holidays."
Great product but he expiration date is April 2010. That's a short period of time to use 6 bottles of dressing. It's a good idea if amazon notes earlier expiration dates so no surprises are found at deleivery.
I love this coffee but the time I bought it before it was $.50 cents a serving. This time I belive I paid 70cents per serving.If it does not go back down I will probably not buy it again.
"This product is a godsend if you are on a wheat free/gluten free/yeast free diet.  Just like the directions say, you need to toast this to make it taste good.  Also, stick with it.  You will get used to the taste, and if you are on one of these restricted diets, it's well worth sticking to them to keep yourself healthy.  We are on the Amazon automatic delivery which is extremely convenient, and is by far the least expensive way to purchase this often hard to find product."
"The first thing besides the bone health claim that I look at is the sodium content.  All in all a pretty convenient mix.  I appreciate having a healthy snack (nut) other than just raw unsalted almonds etc.  Therefore, I have bought more and will continue to do so.  A bit pricey; but nutritious."
"love the taste, keeps my sugar levels normal when used between big meals! i really loved how it tastes has a great texture and  it s a great snack to carry in your purse to drag everywhere you go!!"
"this has become my favorite ceral i eat 3 or 4 bowls a day the taste is amazing and there are a ton of marshmallows which i love! i cant put them away its right next to my bowl even my children love them i cant wait til they come out with these as some sort of treat i would jus love it!the limit edition 1 with wilma ill eat it but its just not as good as the original 1 with fred on the box i actually went to the store an dug thru all the boxes and bought all the original ones they had left in the back now they dont have anymore and alot of the stores around where i live dont sell them,so i decided to go online and order them.i mean if it comes down to it ill buy the other one without a doubt,but id much rather have the other. It is like crack im addicted to them!"
"My Keurig coffee maker made me a coffee drinker, Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee has me looking forward to a cup every morning. Medium Bodied, with an intoxicating butter toffee scent. Makes breakfast extra special."
"Please, don't bite into white powdered donuts unless you have a glass of milk nearby because that's the ultimate way to appreciate the taste of donuts.  The milk makes them soft and super satisfying.  Actually milk is the *only* way you should be eating donuts (and cookies too- let us not forget the taste of cookies changes thanks to the welcoming presence of a glass of Santa's milk).  I refuse to accept any other way.  Okay, perhaps grape juice and donuts is a worthy alternative.  Just don't DIP the donuts in the juice.  That's what gross people would do.  Though I REALLY don't believe you should be paying 11 bucks for a bag of white powdered delicious donuts here on amazon when the same darn bag is like, right uptown at the grocery store..."
"These treats are good for dogs, all natural and yummy! My black lab loved them and went through one a day! Hopefully they helped with her hips!"
"I am the primary cook in our home and have developed a taste for Thai food during my business travels.  No local restaurants fill this niche so I researched some recipes and found a few that looked good - but they required fish sauce (among other hard to find ingredients).  Ordered this from Amazon and although I have no basis for saying whether this is a good or bad quality product, the recipes turned out top notch.  Greatly exceeded my expectations.  Although this fish sauce was only one of many ingredients, it played a part in the final menu so I will rate it as such.<br /><br />On the down side - I think it is pricey for what it is and the seller shows no mercy on shipping.  It is probably manufactured for penny's a gallon but I guess it goes back to supply and demand and where I live, there is no local supply."
"I love coffee that I buy locally and this product allows me to use it in my Keurig brewer.  Getting the lid on is a little challenging, but the end result is worth it.  This is the coolest find of mine this year!!"
"Way too good to be a microwave meal.  I was raised on Italian food, and never thought I would like a boyardee meal.  Was I wrong!  Great taste, fills you up just right.  Try it once and you will be hooked!"
"I am not sure how I am going to write 20 words about this - it is good coffee and I enjoy drinking it. I even drank it during the spring, which is not the usual time to be drinking this autumn-like beverage. It does not taste as good as a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks (what does? those are so good!), but it is an improvement over standard coffee for when you want something different in my opinion. I am happy I bought this and would recommend it."
"We love these organic corn chips. They have an excellent crunch big chips great for dipping. Try with  Salsa, Mild, Organic, 17.5 oz. or homemade salsa. We have these on suscribe and save so we never run out. Very delicious corn taste similar to fritos."
"This Himalayan Crystal Salt is wonderful! I don't know which one I like better - this one, or French Gray Sea Salt. Both are very good and make whatever you're eating a 100x better!"
"[...]<br /><br />This goes a very long ways.  I bought 8 grams and will be using it for several years.  I made saffron bread with it which I didn't love.  The saffron taste was good, just my bread recipe was maybe the wrong one.  Next time I will use a different recipe.  I haven't used it for tea."
"This stuff is a miracle! Tastes great, no calories, no sodium, no sugar! I can't believe it. I drink all of the flavors. Can't decide which is my favorite. Don't know how they do it but I loooove It!!!"
"Boo Amazon!  I thought I loved you for the convenience you offer and the reasonable pricing, but when you raise the price of a recurring item *40%* in two-month's time, I feel like you're scamming me.  The first month I paid about $13, the next month about $15,  Ok, fine, demand goes up, I get it.  Next month: $21!!  And you don't even give me special notice?  And this item costs $0.49/can or $15.68 per 32 in any major grocery store on sale?  Feels like you're preying on the busy, confused, or unaware.<br /><br />Bottom line: Sign up for Subscribe & Save, dear shopper, but keep your eyes on the price!"
This a a great breakfest cereal that keeps one full for hours unlike many I have eaten.  It is full of nuts and fruit and tastes great.  I think it lacks some sweetness and I add a few teaspoons of a non calory sweetener and it is just right. I do recommend this as a low fat nutricious breakfast.
"This is one of my favorite herbal teas for everyday drinking. It's very appley compared to some other brands of apple cinnamon tea, but the apple and cinnamon components are well-balanced with the chamomile to make a flavorful tea. I recommend Subscribe and Save, because this tea can be addictive. You will run out before you know it!"
"My kids are pretty open to dried friut or the like, but they say these are not good at all.  I think I will return them."
"I bought this Glico Collection to try out other unusual flavors of Pocky and other related products. I received what is available in their current stock:<br /><br />2 2.82 oz Glico Chocolate Pocky<br />3 1.16 oz Glico Strawberry Pocky<br />1 1.16 Sweet Milk Pocky<br />1 3.53 oz. Chocolate Almond Crush Pocky<br />1 Glico Coconut Chocolate Pocky<br />1 Toppo Cocoa Sticks 2.5 oz.<br />1 Glico Roasted Pretz 2.46 oz.<br />1 Glico Corn Pretz 2.46 oz<br />1 Glico Salad Pretz 2.46 oz.<br />1 Hello Kitty Strawberry Chocolate Sticks<br />1 Orange Hi-chew<br /><br />I've tried the Sweet Milk-- it was OK and tasted like condensed milk dipped sticks.<br />My favorite is the Chocolate Almond Crush- very addicting, chocolatey and nutty.<br />Strawberry is good too.<br /><br />I wish I bought my own mix from another online store. This Glico pack is not worth it as I can buy the other varieties cheaper at an Asian supermarket that are well stocked with Pocky coming from regional Glico Pocky flavors."
"Great coffee, not too strong for by morning cup and still a great afternoon cup. I have added this blend to my favorites !"
"The flavor was good, but saddly I have to watch my Sodium intake and this product has too much for me."
"I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase."
"Taza chocolate is hands down one of the greatest tasting chocolates one can buy.  The consistency may not be for everyone (some people don't seem to like the somewhat grainy texture) but I find it enhances the flavors.  These small discs contain such intense flavor and taste, you will not be disappointed.  I've had several different flavors and they are all amazing.  Taza has the taste of fresh, quality ingredients and carefully selected flavors.  There are fancier, more expensive chocolates out there but few compare to Taza."
"I really like the taste and balanced nutrition & sugar amount in this product but the stickiness is rather a disappointment. Straight to the pros and cons of this fruit&nut bar:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Tastes great; balanced sweet and savoury.<br />+ Right amount of nutrition, balanced sugar too. Less sweet compared to the typical energy bar.<br />+ Vegan and Gluten-free. Great choice if you have a special diet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The 'syrup mix' that makes the nuts and berries stick together is very sticky. The wrapper tend to stick to the bar so it's not so easy to peel it open.<br />- I eat energy bar as quick breakfast or snack on the go. Having my lips and fingertips sticky after eating this isn't a nice feeling especially when there's no tissue/water around to wipe it off.<br /><br />If you don't mind the stickiness, this product is a great addition to your choice of healthier snack, for a healthier lifestyle."
Nutricity provided us with exceptional customer service. We will definitely look to them again in the future for our needs.
Glad I heard about this product and tried it. Helped put me right to sleep drinking 30 minutes before. I'm Army so the sooner I can get to sleep the better. Loved it!
"Emerald Harmony Deluxe Fruit I shared with family, friends, FaceBook and Church members. The reply I receive great and delicious. The Trail Mix eat 1/4 for snack, with cereal and with salad. Don't just take my word, try all the Trail Mix, great price and size bags, I can't found  this brand Trail Mix in stores in Tallahassee, Florida."
The price was right and the coffee was not bad tasting (not great either) but the smell (not really an aroma) when you open the package is a turn off. The semi-K-cup design fits the coffee maker ok but not so well in the carousel.
"I really like coffee, but overall I would rate this as ""okay"" tasting - it is very strong, and has a bit of a bite in the flavoring that made me get a piece of gum to get the taste out of my mouth.  After a couple of sips, I was done and would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />I opened this can up in the office, and passed around small sampler cups to my co-workers to get their thoughts as I work with several coffee connoisseurs.  Three women and one man said they thought it was good, and the three women would rate it a 4 on a 5 scale while the man said he would rate it a 3..<br /><br />Another man who typically buys and enjoys the Starbucks canned beverages said he would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Including myself, none of the test subjects hated it but everyone said the same thing - while they thought it was good, none of them believed it was ""good enough"" to make them want to go out and purchase some.  When I asked why, they had the same impression I had in that the coffee place downstairs was better none of us were really compelled to add this to our regular routines and shopping lists.<br /><br />One thing to note is there is a lot of sugar in this 6.4 ounce can: 10g!  The sugar and the caffeine combined should give you a little kick in the afternoon if that is what you are seeking."

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

"My seven year old son after initially saying he would take these, refused after the first few days so we gave up for a few weeks. Then miraculously he started taking them (wants to be extra smart in school) and now takes a full dose without a problem. I guess it is easier to reason with a seven year old."
"My physician has suggested that I try to use more decaf and less regular coffee. Indeed, I have experimented with a number of decaf products over the past several months. Some are good, some aren't. Some have a nice coffee taste; others are pretty bland.<br /><br />I have tried some of Newman's Own K-cup flavors and have generally found the whole line pretty satisfying. This decaf is no exception. It has a nice coffee taste (it is labeled ""extra bold). It isa organic, to the extent that that has value for the person wishing to try a cup out. For me, though, the key thing is that it has a good coffee taste and I like starting the day off with a decent cup.<br /><br />So, if you'd like to trey out a decaf, this isn't a bad starting point."
"As expected, this is a good strong cup of coffee. Although the flavors are subtlety different, I also enjoy the French roasts from Tulleys and Starbucks.  The best value is usually Green Mountain."
"Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and ""prescription"" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />""Eagle Pack"" was prior brand name before it changed over to ""Holistic Select"" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues. My review applies specifically to the Anchovy/Sardine/Salmon recipe."
"My Boston Terrier gets one Greenie regular each day to keep teeth clean. Should I forget it's time for her Greenie, she sits and stares at me until I remember. Vet says her teeth are in great shape."
"We have to keep these chews in a cupboard, or else the cats would eat them all at once. We give them as a treat once a day. The size is a a bit daunting, but at least for my cats, it keeps them busy for a while. Each cat is too busy with their own treat to try to steal another cat's.<br />The price here is better than what I found locally, too, so this is a good purchase for me."
"I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or ""burnt"" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time."
"After lusting after my sister's waffle maker (she posts pics on facebook...cruel!) I received a waffle maker of my very own for Mother's Day! My wonderful husband also bought a 3pk of this waffle mix. As empty-nesters, the serving size is perfect..we make 2 ""batches"" for 4 waffles. The waffles are SO tasty. Malt > buttermilk any day! :) This mix is easy and delicious.<br />Whenever he and I both have Saturday mornings off, we have waffles..no fail. It is a wonderful ""new"" tradition, and this mix makes it easy and tasty!"
"I first tried these seeds when one of my teammates on my Sunday league Baseball team had a bag. I was hooked instantly. I ordered a pack of 12 from Amazon and brought a bunch to share with the team the following week. I have to say, at least, 15 of the 22 guys on the team consistently have these at the games now.<br /><br />These seeds are noticeably larger than other brands (i.e. David and Frito Lay). Also, these are the only Dill Pickle flavored seeds I've ever had (and I've tried 'em all, being a huge fan of Dill Pickles) that ACTUALLY taste like pickles. It's uncanny. The people at Bigs deserve a medal for this.<br /><br />Now, I'm a lifelong fan/customer. I just ordered my second case not too long ago and I anticipate having to order a 3rd in a few weeks. A++++ product!"
"I have been feeding my cats Newman's Own Organics Organic Beef and Liver for years now and their health is the better for it.  Whenever I go to the vet and mention that I'm feeding them this they have nothing but good things to say.  The kitties love it and their hairless ape of a dad loves it to... loves to watch them love it, I don't eat it myself... not yet."
"I drink Chamomile tea to make the day ""go away"" and hubby drinks this, he says its the only thing that can make him feel calmer from anxiety, stress and constant worry. I can SEE the diffrence in him after he's had a cup or two. If you're looking for tea for anxiety issues, tension tamer, hawthrorn tea and St. Johns wort are your best bests IHO. Drink up!"
"I have never seen my dogs as happy as when they seem me take out the greenies bag.  They are pricey but, what can you do?"
"I love my Keurig, but the k-cups are so expensive, so I shopped til I found this one at a great price.  I knew I was taking a chance, but I wasn't disappointed.  The coffee is a little strong for my taste, but adding a bit more milk mellows it out very well.  Also like that they've done away with the outside (plastic) shell, making this 'greener'.  All in all, it's a great coffee at a great price, and I'm ordering more."
"The Quaker Oatmeal Raisin cookies could not be more delicious! They have that homemade taste w/out all the mess!! I was surprised at how soft they were and you could really taste cinnamon and other flavors, they did not taste processed.  The most important thing- my kids loved them too!"
This infusion looks like coffee and tastes like nothing else. It has a roasty and slightly spicy flavor that pairs excellently with oatmeal.
"I have always loved Slim Jims.  I love the taste of the ?? meat.  The ?? liquid that resides in little pockets within the stick is absolutely divine.  When hungry, I can eat one of these and I'm good for 4-5 hours.  The sticks last forever.  I just wish I could bring myself to read the ingredients...."
"I'm not really going to talk too much about the flavor of this chipotle pepper sauce. If you're considering buying this quantity, you've probably had it before. And you probably love it as much as I do. You might even put it on everything.<br /><br />If you're currently buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EPZO"">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce 5oz.</a> on a regular basis, this is a no-brainer. This container holds the same as 13 of the 5oz. bottles, so you save $40 buying in bulk.<br /><br />It's an added bonus that they shipped this with a free jar of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EYK3E"">TABASCO Spicy Mayonnaise 16 oz.</a> which is a decent freebie. I'm not big on mayo, but it isn't half bad."
"the natural truffles have an unsweetened coaco powder on the outside with a nice smooth texture.  this is not to sweet more of a european style candy, wonderful."
"First of all, I am a huge fan of chocolates so when I saw this cereal, I had to try it. My husband describes this as if eating a slice of chocolate cake but to me, it had the chocolate taste to it but it was very artificial tasting and not as good as other chocolate cereals I've had. The milk makes it so it's all soggy and no crunch and it only takes a few seconds for it to turn soggy. The way around it was to eat it dry and then take a quick chug of milk. That helped it a little bit but it's still not one that I would be buying on a regular basis.<br /><br />Compared to some of the other chocolate cereals on the market, such as cocoa pebbles, cocoa puffs, etc., this is probably at the low end of the totem for me."
Good stuff. I wish they would run a special on it though. I liked it. it is all i can find. locally i cannot find any cola syrup. but it tastes pretty good to me. i always wait until the price is right then i grab a few. i enjoy drinking it.
"I bought this tea because I had previously tried an orange spice tea I got in a supermarket.  I thought the loose tea would be a higher quality tea.  I'm no expert but this tea is definitely a higher quality than the flavored teas I have gotten from supermarket tea bags.  It smells wonderful and makes very good hot or iced tea.  I was a little surprised at the strength of the spice flavor.  This is why I only rated it 3 stars.  I was expecting more orange and less spice.  I am enjoying it but next time I may try a different orange spice loose tea to find one with a milder spice flavor.  I may even experiment with mixing it with a milder tea.  If you are looking for a tea with a strong cinnamon, peppery spice flavor, this tea is for you."
"I typically use my Keurig as a hot water dispenser, running it without kcups because they generally are too weak, even on the small cup setting.<br /><br />So, I'm very much in the market for stronger k cups.<br /><br />I can make medium size cups with this pod, but it's still a bit weak, and still bitter.  Makes a very strong small cup.  Perfect would be 2 pods, one cup, one brewed on short and the other on medium.<br /><br />As for the flavor of the beans, they produce a full bodied, bold and bitter cup.  Not necessarily a bad bitter, as it is pure arabica, however, I personally wouldn't recommend having more than one cup of these a day.  That bold flavor loses it's luster cup after cup, so it's not really a good all-around coffee.<br /><br />It's a good first or second cup of the morning coffee.  It's kind of like a cup of ""good new york city coffee"" back before the coffee renaissance of the past decade.<br /><br />Buying this in the extra large amount may not be suitable from an individuals' point of view because it's not something you'll want to drink 2+ times a day."
"Wing Time is the best buffalo wing sauce you'll ever get.  The garlic is my favorite, thought the medium and hot are equally good, depending on your burn preferences.  Hot is hot, though not inedible (though haven't tried the ""super-hot"").  Also low sodium for those who care."
I've been buying these for my dogs for the past few months and they love them! The price is right and my dogs are happy... Can't ask for much else
"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!"
I recently picked up the blueberry flavored cookies to try and liked them.  But this Cranberry Citrus Oat flavor is even better.  It's a thin cookie made with real fruit and whole grains.  The cookies are crispy and sized right. They are in a tray which keeps them from breaking and they stay fresh in the package. I'll buy these again and want to try other flavors.
Ahh!  PG tips.  The taste of home and I can't buy it around it here.  Love it!
"I am very happy with the product, however when I received it there was a broken K-cup. I believe it happened during packaging. The outside box was fine. The cup was smashed. It looks like the orders are filled by machine and it got crushed. Coffee was everywhere.<br /><br />Just wanted you to be aware of this problem.<br />Thank you<br />Pat Boudreau"
"Product arrived quickly. It was not what I thought I ordered.  I thought I ordered spaghetti, turns out I ordered spaghettini. My fault. However, it tastes great, not wheaty. Just like I was lead to beleive from the cooking show I saw it on. Not completely happy but very satisfied."
"I've known this drink since a child, especially around Xmas time when this was d most sought after drink, u know it's Xmas when you were served this drink!  Yeah!!!  It's still the best -all year round."
"I honestly love the flavor of this spice.  I have a chicken salad recipe that I use this with and it's hard to not eat all the chicken salad by myself.  I do not like chicken salad but I went to a party that had little chicken salad cracker sandwiches and the person used some southwestern flavored spice mixed in with other ingredients.  When I went shopping this was the only spice I could find that said Southwestern.  The first time I used it I realized that the sandwiches tasted better with this seasoning than the other little cracker appetizers I had.  I have used this seasoning now for 6 years and would not use any other.  It's very hard to find at the grocery stores now so, when I found that I could purchase this item at Amazon I did."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1CG50"">Arctic Paws 2-1/2-Pound Yummy Chummies Original Bulk treats</a>I picked up a package of these chews at a local pet store and my dogs just loved the salmon taste.  I wanted to get another since the chews were so popular with the dogs and I went back to the pet store I purchased them from.  They couldn't find any and didn't have any on order, so I came home and went to Amazon, my go-to guys. The order arrived in two days and the dogs are happy again.  They just love these treats.  Both dogs sit on the floor and stare up at the top of the refrigerator where I keep the large bag.  It didn't take long for them to find the hiding place, so I know they like the Chewies and the salmon is also a healthy treat for them.  I will continue buying them at Amazon.<br /><br />The Chewies are soft but keep well in a sealed bag so they don't have to be refrigerated.  This makes the 2 and 1/2 bag a real deal."
"To be honest, I didn't want to like this formula. I was having gas and spit-up issues with Enfamil Newborn and our pediatrician recommended this for our 2 week old son. When I read the ingredients and saw that the first one is corn syrup, I balked and purchased a three pack of Baby's Only Organic from Amazon, hoping it would work for us. It made my baby terribly constipated. So I bought the Target brand Gentle formula which is supposed to be comparable to this. It is, but we were still getting spit ups. I switched to a mix of Enfamil Newborn and Enfamil AR. Back to horrible, screaming gas issues. Finally, reluctantly, I had to admit that of the four things we'd tried, this is the best for us. I bought the brand name because the Target brand smelled like malt mix and doesn't mix well. There is really no difference between Enfamil and Target other than the smell and color. Enfamil doesn't mix well either. Both give my son horrible green swamp poops which are runny and explosive. But apparently that's normal with the gentle formulas. Yuk.<br /><br />My son does better on this. I suspect he has lactose sensitivities and this, while not really cutting down on the gas, helps him to pass it and not scream in pain all day. He sleeps well and eats without pain. While I would like him to eat something that doesn't make his diapers so nasty, it's worth it. Plus, we use cloth diapers so the poop doesn't explode out of the diaper and onto his clothes. It does make for some very interesting diaper changes.<br /><br />I'm still not completely settled on this, but I have a two month supply so we are on it for now. I just wish I could find something that would agree with him without the gross diapers and less than ideal ingredients.<br /><br />Update:  I switched to Baby's Only LactoRelief and saw a HUGE improvement in reflux symptoms in just 1 feed!  His stools improved drastically and he is a new baby!  I have come to believe that it was not reflux at all."
My grandchildren loves twizzlers!! Very satisfied with the timely order and the freshness of the twizzlers. Definitely will order again.
"I have had wonton soup since i was a kid. Somehow in the past few years, the price doubled on these cans. The filling has decreased a lot so it's mostly noodle. It's still a yummy soup, with a good flavor that is similar to chicken noodle but a little different. However at the current price, it's almost not worth it."
"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet."
"The product was okay but the color was very different than advertised.  It was a darker pink, not red at all.<br /><br />I tried to use it a couple different ways, and as a relative beginner, I did not find the product easy to use.<br /><br />I tried mixing in with a little vanilla extract in order to ""paint"" it on (I had read this was the best way to do it).  I found that the painting was very streaked and not very consistent.  Maybe someone more experienced will be able to use it more effectively.  In the end, because the red color was important for the cake, I mixed it with red food coloring instead of vanilla extract.  the pearl dust used this way had just a little impact on the color, not a great deal.<br /><br />In the end, I would have experimented more on the best way to use it if the color had been more red.  But as was, I didn't find it super useful and will be unlikely to purchase again.  I hope that other people have a better experience as I very much like the idea of the product."
"These saltines have been around ever since the beginning of time, or so I think!  You can even get antique tins in which these used to be sold.  They're still the best in my book, have the best flavor, do the best job of keeping away the flu symptoms, and taste the best in soups and recipes.  I don't buy anything else any more.  I've tried them all just for fun and always have to come back to Premium.  Highly recommend!"
"I was sick of eggs. And sick of cornflakes. So when I spotted the Pancake mix from Bob's, I had to try it. Like all of their products, it was really easy to make - just like any pancake mix. The first batch I made, however, were... well, let's say ""Dense."" I was feeding a guest, who clutched his throat and asked for liquid to wash it down. But I didn't think they were THAT bad, considering the wheat free sludge I'd engaged before. So, I drowned mine in maple syrup and thought it was quite tasty.<br /><br />The next time, I tried modifying the recipe a bit with fruit - fresh blueberries to be exact. And those came out a lot moister and less dense. Mmm... blueberry pancakes... wonderful! I've tried other fruit, tossed in applesauce once... and each time, I got interesting twists on much moister pancakes.<br /><br />I still don't eat them often -- just when I'm having a ""help, I can't eat another egg"" moment. Actually, they are good as part of a big brunch, with an egg over easy on top. Since can't eat bread with my eggs, it takes the place of toast.<br /><br />I've wondered if whipping these frothy with a beater might help but haven't tried it yet. All in all, they're tasty, if a little thick, very filling and easy to whip up."
"Product handles as it should. Keeps Kcups organized and the drawer slides out easily. The only thing better would be if I could put my Keurig on top, but it makes it too tall for use, under my cabinets. I placed other coffee related items on top, so it still works out nicely."
"I buy extra bold coffee and brew it on the mug size in my Cuisinart Single Serve Brewing System, it makes the perfect cup of coffee. This coffee has a rich flavor, just perfect."
"the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds! and they grew very easily in pots, too."
"Delicious, healthy and cheaper than Gatorade and other artificial beverages. America should embrace the taste of the tropics."
"We originally found these at Wally World.  When we could no longer get there, I hit the internet.  Both are quite good . . . we prefer the spicy."
"My Rottie, with a sensitive stomach, is able to tolerate these treats well.  The best part is she actually has to chew them for a few moments...if you have a Rottwieler you know what I mean.  Any treat is chomped on in 1 second and gone... I feel good about these treats because they seem very healthy for large dogs...although, my daughters Chiauau loves them !"
"Coffee is ok but don't know whether I will reorder or not.  Rather weak but if your machine has the water level setting, I would suggest that you use one of the smaller cups."
"I love this product and am happy that I ordered a case! I feel great that he loves them and they are organic, packaged in a bpa free container. My son gobbles these in a high chair so happily while we dine out. It is fantastic. I also love that I do not need to break them up like other finger food. He has never had an issue swallowing them, even before he had his top teeth."
"The other reviewer mentions it not being very strong.  I like strong coffee as well and generally use 2 bags.  But, the convenience of this product is what makes it great.  You can take it camping, to your office if you don't have a coffee maker, visiting friends/family or at home, if you have little counter space and don't want a coffee maker there.  It's definitely not Starbucks or anything like that, but it's a great product.  The convenience of a tea bag and the ability to have your coffee on the go."
Nice size and quality for the price.  My dogs chew this things 24/7. Fast shipping.  No problems.
"I compared this to Ahmad Tea -London- and Twinings of London versions of Earl Gray Tea.  I let them all steep one minute in the same amount of water.<br />Higgens and Burke had the strongest bergamot of the three.  Ahmad was most astringent, H&B second, and Twinigs smoothest.<br />By the third cup. (re-using the same bag) H&B was practically perfect.<br />Since I prefer subtler and smoother  Earl Gray, my recommendation is to use more water (like a small teapot for one bag rather than a cup or mug) and be careful how long you leave it in.<br />If you are a fan of strong tea or double bergamot tea, I think you will really like this."
"These k-cups taste good and are great for a quick Chai fix. They're also a good coffee alternative, but they not good enough to replace my Starbucks stop for a Chai latte or an Apple Chai."
"Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as ""Delicious and Decadent""  and they are being extremely modest."
"Excellent Product, Great Price, On time Delivery, Highly Recommend this product to anyone that goes through a lot of coffee like my husband."
"I'm looking for a really good chai to make at home. This had good reviews and my local grocery store actually carried it. I brought it home, made a cup and literally couldn't drink it. I had to put 3 tsp the sugar in it and extra cream to even be able to take a few sips. And thats reslly saying domething because i usually take little to no sugar in my tea. I actually like bitter black tea. This chai by stash isn't bitter so much as just plsin bad. I love chai and used to order loose leaf ( at a high price) from a place online that doesn't have it anymore. I guess you get what you pay for. This tea has a terrible after taste i can't begin to describe. Like dirt or sour cinnamon. I like both cinnamon and cloves so i'm not sure my complaint is the same as other reviewers. It really tastes like old bitter, sour, cheap spices to me! Glad i got this on sale at the store rather than wasted money ordering here. This box willbe going to work, annonously so no one knows it's from me! Or perhaps i should just throw it out. Don't like to be wasteful but I can't bear the thought of drinking a whole box of this!"
"I really love this maca powder.  It has a nice texture and tastes very good to me.  (I may be weird, but I like to take it in small amounts right off the spoon and love the taste.)  It's great in smoothies if you don't want to taste it.  Gives me energy and also energy of the root chakra kind if you know what I mean.  If your sex drive is low, give it a try for a few weeks and see what you think.  It seems to help with hormonal balance or something wonderful.  I take a spoon every day and sometimes skip a day or so if I can stand to, just to help my body stay responsive to the maca.  Wonderful stuff.  Keep it coming!  Is there such a thing as too much maca?"
"Totally disgusting, nothing like CHAI tea, its taste is more like cheap old black tea. Don't waste your money on ordering this tea. Just feel totally duped, can't return it!"
"Plocky's chips are made of several whole grains and have a touch of sweetness.  They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery, but seem to be difficult to obtain as the shelf is always empty.  Order by the case.  You'll be glad you did as they disappear fast."
"I've bought the big size of smarties before in the store, but they're not THIS big.  These packs are about 6 inches long with smarties about the diameter of quarters, though thicker.  They don't have as much of a curve toward the middle as little smarties, but they have that same pressed-candy powder taste and texture."
"I recently started drinking flavored coffees, since I preferred regular to hazelnut and french vanilla.  This coffee changed that. This coffee has a rich flavor and tastes great.  I have started keeping a supply on hand, and have had black coffee drinkers try this, and so far they have all said this is the only flavored coffee that they thought tasted good.  Try it you won't be disappointed."
"We tried this a couple times, but we have a SUBSTANTIAL preference for the Kraft Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad.  It's the same idea as this, but for some reason the Betty Crocker Suddenly Salad gave our family upset stomachs both times we tried it.  In fact, my kids started calling it ""Suddenly something down your leg"", which is what it is known as to this day in our house.  The sad part is the Kraft version is MUCH harder to find, but definitely superior.  Check out the Kraft one - more delicious and less crampy results."
"I have made Iced Chai Lattes with this mix for about five people now and they all LOVE it.  There are instructions on the side of the container that tell you how to do it.  It's very simple.  My only suggestions is this:  When it says to use 1 and 1/3 cups of powder, only use 1 cup.  It can be too sweet if you use the amounts they tell you to use."
"I think it tastes pretty darn good.<br />I was a Diet Dr. Pepper addict at one point in my life.  I gave it up for the aspartame and sodium it contained.<br />It is nice to have an alternative that is 0 calories and I look forward to the day that Soda stream creates a diet line that is sweetened with stevia  instead of sucralose.  For now it is a better, greener alternative."
This stuff is yummy in the tummy.  Get some. It tastes like bacon.  I'm glad I am not a Muslim because they probably can't eat this stuff.  That is a good thing.  That leaves more for me.  Ha ha.  I have this set up on the automatic order system through Amazon.com  That makes the price a dollar or two cheaper.  It also makes it convenient for me so that I can keep my canned goods rotating.  Instead of ordering or purchasing large quantities that all have the same expiration date on them I will keep getting new stock with fresh dates on them.  I have my system set up for every two months so I will get 6 fresh cans at a time.  This is just one of the ways that I am staying prepared for emergencies.  Don't get caught with your pantry empty.  History could repeat itself so do some little things to help make sure that you will have a little food stored for the unexpected.<br />By the way I slice this up and fry it in the skillet.  It really does smell and taste like bacon.<br />I think I bought some at Sam's Club once but when I went back for more they did not have it.<br />Wal-Mart didn't have it either.<br />What I do is open the can and extract the meat from inside carefully.  I make at least 8 equal slices.  Thinner is better but I find that I like uniformity in my slice.  I spray the skillet lightly with some non stick spray.  Turn the burner on high and wait a minute or two for it to get hot. Place the slices in the pan for 4 or 5 minutes and turn the heat back to medium high.  Flip them over and brown both side.  If either side isn't uniformly brown flip again until it is just right.<br />Cooking them this way will reduce the fat content a little.  It adds a lightly crisp texture and a cooked meat flavor.  I like to eat them just like that out of the pan.  I also like to put two slices between bread with a little mustard.
"This is a sturdy, handy little gadget.  Love the color.  Holds 18 cups- plenty of choices.  We keep it right by the machine.  Love it!"
"I ordered the first bottle a month ago and measured an ounce a day in a 7 oz glass of water, just the right mixture for taste and of course doing it this way the bottle lasted 32 days. I just received the second bottle today and am ready for another 32 days. Funny thing happened during shipping, the bottle was distorted with the cap being bent down into the top side,(good thing bottle is plastic & bent ok),and can't be straightened but no spillage happened, so I will carefully open and pour the syrup into the first bottle. The design of the bottle makes pouring into a shot glass easy for measurement."
"We have come very close to ordering cases of these mangoes when we've visited Hawaii - this is a far cry from the hard, somewhat-sweet mangled slices we've seen in our local health food stores. Beautiful, delicious, perfectly sweet and zingy."
"This is my favorite coffee out of all coffees, other than German coffee.  So many flavors and blends to choose from.  They also are huge supporters of our Troops.  They have a Military Match program when you buy 4 bags they will match 4 bags FREE.  I have been able to keep my hubby stocked with coffee through every deployment thanks to Community."
"When I eat junk food, I'd like to enjoy it, the guilty pleasure it is.<br /><br />These cookies are neither healthy or tasty.  Stick to Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies."
"When you first open a tin of this, you smell this nice fruity aroma. But, when you taste it, you realize the flavor is kind of dull and lacking. I'd probably only buy this again for a party or something, since it's expensive too."
"My kids love brownies, but I could no longer by the regular brands in the grocery store with a good conscious.  I still wanted the convenience of a mix, though.  These fit the bill.  They first time I made them, they thought they tasted ""funny"" because they were so used to the processed crap.  Now they eat them up and have gotten used to the flax taste.  I think they are YUMMY!<br />These are in no way low-calorie or low-fat though.  Instructions call for a lot of oil, eggs, and butter (you can use Earth Balance and egg replacer if you're vegan).  Flax seeds also have a good amount of fat (although the healthy kind). I've made them with olive oil before and they were just as good.  I've also added extra organic cocoa powder to make them extra chocolatey, but they really don't need it.  I love the chewy texture of the flax seeds.  There are very few ingredients, I could probably make the same brownies homemade, but it would be a pain to have to grind the flax seeds, etc.  These are easy and yummy.  Even though they are not necessarily ""healthy"" from a calorie and fat standpoint, I can feel good about giving my kids treats that aren't loaded with processed crap."
"Came decently packaged, in a plastic jar, much like the picture. This is raw honey, not medical grade, but the UMF properties are still quite evident. You can easily smell the flowers in the honey. This stuff works well with MRSA, even when taken internally. The sores went from taking months to heal to days."
"As far as buttered popcorn goes, it's what you'd expect. Nothing special taste wise, does NOT taste anything like cheese. It tastes just like normal buttered popcorn. It does however smell VERY funny when it is being cooked. I've noticed that this popcorn pops much faster than any other brand i've tried.<br /><br />All in all, horrible cheese popcorn, standard for buttered."
"I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, much cheaper. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them."
"I ordered this in Nov. 2010. I saw the other review from Jan. 2011 saying they got expired boxes sent to them. I'd encourage them to buy again because my expiration date was March 12, 2012 and it tasted just like I remember from growing up. Love it and ordering 2 packs this time. :)"
"We have been using Pill Pockets for about 5 years, for Cocker Spaniel that must take seizure medication.  He has never refused to take it.  It is a little treat I always put on top of his food, and even if he doesn't eat his food for some reason, he always eats the Pill Pocket.  Also, I have paid $11-13 EACH bag for all those years at a popular pet store.  To pay $20 for FOUR bags (same weight, same product), is like a huge sale for me.  Very happy with purchase and deal!"
"If an old-fashioned potato chips and some rice cakes had a love child it would be this!  It has 100 calories per pag(3g of fat, 0g sat fat) and a sweet taste that reminds you of a rice cake that has a potato chip taste.  While it will not make you forget the classic potato chip, those who are looking for a salty 100 calorie snack will greatly appreciate this."
"My main use for almond, soy, or rice milk is to use in coffee or tea.  The best so far is Silk soymilk original but this Silk almond milk is very nearly as good.  Actually as far as taste goes I'd say the almond milk might be best but for using in coffee the soy edges out the almond for creaminess.  I totally enjoy them both and have been buying the almond milk from Amazon at a very fair price.  But now it's off the Subscribe and Save program so the cost will go up .  I intend to continue buying either Silk almond or Silk soy milk because they are the best for me."
I read some of these reviews and I felt I had to leave one of my own. This mustard is AMAZING! The person who threw this out because it was horrible astounds me! I on the other hand will scrape the last drop out of the container. Highly reccommended! As far as the artificial stuff....who really cares? Almost anything you buy has artificial flavors and stuff....welcome to American food. This mustard will always hold a special place in my fridge and will always have more waiting in the pantry.
"Best Flavor yet and instant favorite, cant stop eating!! : Choc Chip Cookie Dough<br />All time favorite snack: Cashew<br />Gonna try (next best thing ?): Chocolate Chip Brownie<br /><br />OK Flavors<br />Pretty Good but slightly acidic : Banana cookie<br />Tangy and sour for alternative taste: Pecan<br />Alternative to cashew with a Tang : Key Lime<br />Sweet and Tang : Carrot cake<br />Sweeter Chocolate alternative : Chocolate coconut<br /><br />Fail Flavors:<br />Too strong to put in mouth : Cherry Pie<br />Too sweet: Coconut cream pie<br />Forgettable : Apple Pie"
"CONVENIENT! Great for on-the-go. My newborn love this and so do I. However, these are pricey compared to the powdered formula. At $40, you get 96oz worth. With the powder formula (from Sams Club), at $27, you get 244oz. We're currently using both types for our newborn. She seems to favor the Ready-to-Go better than the powder."
"This product is a nice, quick, and easy way to make soup that's not out of a can and very reasonable for the price.  The tag attached to the bag has crock pot instructions which I followed. By about hour 4 on low, the soup was done (hours earlier than the instructions stated) and the noodles were complete mush.  We ate it anyway and it was very tasty but the noodle problem could have been avoided.<br /><br />My suggestion is to separate out the noodles from the bag and add them to the crock pot about 30 minutes before you would like to eat.  I also added some frozen Italian meatballs to the soup which really made it a meal.<br /><br />Overall, the taste was good and the price was right."
"I visited Sicily about a decade ago. I ate many almond desserts on the island, and encountered the delicious Sicilian marzipan the first time. Unfortunately, I haven't found the same flavor since... until now. The Stramondo marzipan has a superb intense almond flavor, despite that it does not contain any flavorings, only organic raw sugar and almonds. The texture is very fine,smooth. I cook quite a lot, and like almonds, so I fell in love with the product. The company sends it with UPS as default, i. e. the postage is rather expensive... therefore now I will order three packs of it in one shipment..."
"Absolutely delicious and super handy shelf-stable asceptic lowfat organic milk. Saves time and gas money when I'm out of milk and but need a cup or two; an easy way to live a ""greener"" life by not driving unnecessarily. In the Olympia area, the cartons can also be recycled; check to see if they can in your area.<br /><br />These little cartons have earned a permanent spot in my pantry, in fact I've signed up for Amazon's subscriber service where they will automatically send out a box of them at an interval I chose. What could be more convenient?"
"My 5 month old just started baby foods. He has tried a couple other brands of squash, but did not like them. I picked up SPROUT, and he ate the whole pouch! He loves them! I am now stocking up on other flavors!"
"I was slightly suspicious when I purchased this chocolate hazelnut spread. Several factors concerned me:<br />1. ""raw"" chocolate. I was not familiar with this.<br />2. ""sprouted"" hazelnuts. Never seen that before<br />3. Coconut sugar aka coconut palm sugar. Does this taste like coconut? (No more like caramel!)<br /><br />Well, the stuff delivers and in spades.  This is NOT Nutella, this is a concentrated powerful decadent punch that just happens to be health food.  I spooned this stuff like mana from heaven. Had to hold back from eating too much, but was helped by the concentrated aspect.<br /><br />Since getting my jar I researched all 3 points above and have been converted.<br /><br />Why not 5 starts?  The shipping costs involved are just too high. I understand that these great products carry a premium product price and I'm OK with that, but I just don't think the premium shipping price is warranted. That alone has kept me from re-ordering."
This is the best tea I have ever tasted at home.  The flavors are blended perfectly.  I like to fill a cup with ice then do a quick brew with the Keurig Machine.  No need to add sugar or cream.  I just wish I could find a comparable decaf so I could have an excellent nighttime cup of tea before sleeping.
"They taste fake to me.  I prefer the brand that starts with an A, which is much sweeter and more like a strawberry juice."
"I love my Keurig, and I love Newman's.  Strong, flavorful coffee. And I like that it is organic as well."
"My daughter & I are GF and we both got very sick from eating only these. We didnt eat anything else at night and in morning we were very sick, like we ate alot of gluten. I dont get it, it says GF and Certified, etc. They tasted good, but I felt so bad I couldnt do anything the next day and my poor 3yr old told me her belly hurt. I wont ever eat them again."
"I love this cereal, but will never order it again in this size. It was bad, not much else I can say."
"My English Bulldog loves this food.  He thought it was treats when we were switching him off of Eukanuba.  It's easy for him to eat.  The only hard part is not every pet store sells this food.  The Petsmart near us has it, but the Petco doesn't.  The price is cheaper on Amazon, plus if you are a prime member is free shipping."
"I'm a big Earl Grey Black Tea drinker. This tea was flavorful, but not as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5QI"">Twinings Earl Grey Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> or a Trader Joe's house brand that I buy. The flavor is more subtle and less pronounced. Food flavors like perfume essences are very personal. I prefer the more pronounced flavors in Earl Grey. If you prefer a lighter Earl Grey, you'll love this!"
"I thought it was included in prime and spent over $12.00 including shipping... silly me! This won't happen again, although I really love the tea. Great flavor and doesn't get too strong even after a long brewing period."
This is an excellent crema coffee.  It is perfect for a great cuppa every morning and is my personal favorite.  Highly recommended!!
This is Da BOMB!  Marzipan made from peanuts.  Especially great for peanut butter addicts who think peanut butter cups have too much chocolate.
we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.
"The product is great as you can't find it in stores.  We love to use it sprinkled over white cheddar popcorn, which Target used to sell.  What an incredible flavor!!  BUT, the shipping charge was OUTRAGEOUS!!  DON'T fall for it!!!!"
My 35 pound lab/terrier mix loves this food. I used it as a mix-in with her kibble. Everything arrived from the vendor in tip top shape. Will order again.
"I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more."
"Love KIND bars but can't say this is my favorite.  If you like a strong blueberry taste, then you will LOVE these."
"CLIFFS: 100% Recommended from a paranoid, research crazy owner who wanted nothing but the best for my kitten.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW: My kitten loves this food. As with all kitten/cats you learn they have personalities, specific tastes and favorites.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time researching cat food and discovered so much BAD food out there.<br /><br />THE KEY TO KEEPING YOUR CAT HEALTHY IS GOOD FOOD AND EXERCISE, READ THE INGREDIANTS, THE FIRST 5 ITEMS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ARE THE LARGEST PORTIONS OF THE FOOD.<br /><br />Research indicates this is one of the best all around foods you can feed your cat/kitten. We started with K****nchow, which in the word of cat food is about a 5 outa 10 in quality, its got the #'s but not the wholesome natural ingredients from which they derive. Think about taking a vitamin vs. eating veggies.<br /><br />This brand doesn't pack the most protein (which is crucial to cat development) but its well over the recommended amount, and quiet frankly, I'm not comfortable with a heavy protein diet, I believe there can be too much of a good thing.<br /><br />This grain free food also has lots of actual vegetables and items you can identify in the food itself.<br /><br />This food smells almost fit for human consumption, you can pick up the flavors just by the scent, doesn't smell like typical big brand crap.<br /><br />Many reviews claim softer and shinier coat and I have to agree. I've had a few cats the past 20yrs and hers by far is the softest coat I've ever felt.<br /><br />What I find great is she ignored the K****nchow when wet was out, but now will often choose this to snack on when the wet food has been out a hour or 2.<br /><br />This is good on her stomach and stools are not overly smelly like they were on other brand food we started initially. The food itself doesn't overly smell either.<br /><br />Provides plenty of lasting energy too.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased and could not recommend it more. Pricier? Of course. But its absolutely worth it at the rate she eats this. A bag this size lasts our kitten at least 4 months. For 30 bucks?! Why not?!"
"20lbs showed up, packed in styrafoam cooler with plenty of gel/ice packs as promised.<br /><br />Only 1 dud iA the lot, and he may just have been unmotivated... (very good percentage !)<br /><br />Flavor was good, both raw and fried (with cornmeal in a shallow pan).<br /><br />Amazon Prime Shipping made it quite a good deal!<br /><br />Next time I think I need about twice as many.."
"I and my kids all enjoyed this cereal.  It's not as healthy as some quality, tasty cereals out there (Fiber One, for example) but it's a tasty alternative for breakfast or snack."
"Ok I am a chocolate snob. If things have chocolate in them they have to taste really good. and these do. I bought a box and the local grocer today, there are about 16 wafers in a box and now there are just 2 left."
"Bought a Keurig for times when a single cup of coffee is all that is needed.  What I had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer... until I found the Double Black Diamond Extra Bold. Now my Keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and I don't feel like my ""investment"" is headed to a yard sale/thrift shop anytime soon.  If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one."
"I have read many places that STASH has the highest amounts of antioxidants found in green tea. It is a little pricier than some other brands, but the taste is good, so it is worth it."
good nut bag that works very well no matter how many nuts or coconut meat you need to extract juice easily
Absolutely gross! If you can imagine swallowing a mouth full of gel that will barely go down unless a glass of water is handy. I cannot believe Power Bar Company would put something out like this! We are stuck with a case of this garbage. DO NOT BUY!
If you follow correct method of preparing (let this tea in boiling water for 10-15 minutes) this will taste great.<br /><br />Better place to buy this is go to nearest Indian store they generally sell 1 lb in USA for around 2.99$ only. Not sure why it is overpriced online.
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:06 Mins<br /><br /></span>Celestial Seasonings english breakfast black tea is delicious both hot or as iced tea. The tea has a faint perfume but not overwhelming. I like different teas but find this one to be the best for hot and cold. I love that I can control the strength of the tea. Hot I prefer the medium button, cold, I use the largest cup button. Either way I get a perfect serving of tea."
Mostly I drink coffee but often have a cup of tea too.  First brew was three minutes.  Box said one to three minutes.  Three minutes great taste and high acidity.  Second try two minutes.  Less acid and wonderful taste reminds me of orange blossoms?  Next I will try ONE minute.  When hot water hits tea bag the water instantly changes color to dark tea color.  US Lipton is bland compared to this PG.
I cannot find the 8 oz container of Equal in the grocery stores so I purchased it on Amazon which is easy and it is delivered right to my door.
"Don't be fooled by the label ""great tasting"". When mixed this stuff tastes terrible! If you want something better tasting ""Muscle Milk"" is the way to go."
"These treats are great for training our miniature poodle.  Who is very self willed.  He never seems to tire of these treats. But with that being said we dont give him a lot.  Only one when he does something we are trying to get him to do.<br /><br />I heard one pet owner makes her own.  Havent figured out how to do that yet.  So this is what we are doing now.<br /><br />The price is cheaper than our local pet store.<br /><br />But in my opinion, this company is make a boat load of money, hand over fist.  Knowing the price of liver, cheap, cheap, cheap.  I wish I had a freeze dry machine.<br /><br />Great item for those that are not the do it yourself freeze drier."
This is my favorite drink.  Better than plain coffee.  I truly enjoy it and drink it every day.  It lasts me quite a while as I only have one cup a day.  Great way to start my day.
I was very satisfied with the price and quality of the product. I could not find these gluten free cheetos in any store so I was happy to find them online.
I'm not one who normally eats any cookies. I have tried plenty of cookies though. I also completely agree with the other reviewer who says these cookies are way better than Oreos. These are so much better there's really no comparison. I saw these in a store and the box caught my eye. When I saw the ingredient list it looked like something I would like with unusually high quality and healthy ingredients. I thought they were pricey but I thought I'd give them a try. Now they are one of my main foods I ALWAYS keep in stock. I highly recommend these. They are not too sweet but definitely sweet enough. I could easily eat an entire box in one day but usually struggle to keep it down to about half a box a day. Yes they are very addicting!! If you like chocolate I don't see how you wouldn't like these. These are really good!
"I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again."
"I got these for my Christmas Table and I also gave some to my Cleaning Lady and my Daughter... I love the honey mustard the best*****, plus all the rest are nice, crunchy and also very fresh...Im so glad I bought them, because I hestitated first but now I am happy I got them..Happy Holidays Everyone........."
"The seller did a very good job with packaging.Only thing is that the producer company filled the big jar with a half of stevia powder.In this size 2 pound could fit.But this is not the sellers fault!!!!!They are honest,and reliable shop.Nice to deal with!"
"They are exactly what I've been looking for. Ever since I found them at whole foods in the Bulk Food area I've loved them. The whole foods by me stopped carrying them so I searched on Amazon and found them.<br /><br />These bears do taste exactly the same as regular gummy bears.  Most people who try them can't tell the difference, but after a while you will start being able to taste the artificial sweetener. Given enough times between ""servings"" you'll never tell.<br /><br />Now mind you this is not a ""oh since it sugar free I can eat as much as I want""  item. This requires moderation. The artificial sweeteners in any diet or sugar free item will usually make people sick, with either runs or gas.  Except for very few people, you have to control how much you eat of this or you will get sick.<br /><br />This food is mainly for diabetics and people who can't have sugar in their diet. They usually control how much they eat of these types of items anyway. Otherwise if you can control how much you're eating at one time and not just using it as a replacement for Regular gummy bears, so you can eat more, this is an excellent item.<br /><br />And yes since this is Haribo they will have the extra stiffness most people have come to love about this particular gummy company."
I didn't like this cocoa. It's very bitter and the sweetness is almost undetectable. I had to add sugar. I wouldn't buy it again.
"This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste."
"I didn't seem to be producing enough milk for my son so I decided to try this tea based on a recommendation from a friend. It definitely has an acquired taste much like black licorice, which I don't particularly care for. However, it is bearable once you add a fair bit of honey. It's hard to say if the tea itself worked for me because in addition to the tea, I have been taking fenugreek capsules and pumping after each feeding. In all fairness though, I did notice my milk supply increase. Before this tea and the fenugreek I was only able to pump about a quarter of an ounce or a half ounce on a good day. After the tea and fenugreek, I noticed I was able to pump about two to two and half ounces per session. Not much but still better than before. If you can get past the taste or happen to like licorice, I'd say it's a decent product. Just be sure to add plenty of honey. If nothing else it's a nice tea to drink before bed."
Wonderful jerky that is full of flavor and is not overly dry like the jerky you get at gas stations. I would recommend this to anyone who loves jerky.
Most people have a cow that it isn't American made but I work in an office where a lot of people bring in their dogs and I have yet to find one who didn't like this.
"These are chunks more than cubes, but I like that they are of different sizes - makes it easy to pick out a piece appropriate for different sized mugs.  Great for coffee and tea.  Arrived quickly."
"I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp"
"I was actually fairly hesitant to try to this, but I'm kinda glad I did, it is surprisingly good and is not at all what I expected!<br /><br />  When I finally got around to drinking this, I decided it would be best to warm some up and try it warm, and keep some cold (I had left it in my fridge for a while, in a way dreading drinking it).  I had fully expected to like it cold, and not so much warm or at room temperature, but I actually found the opposite to be completely true!  Warm and at room temperature, I could taste all the flavors, and it has a fairly thin consistency, but cold it is much ""thicker"" and with the chunks of Aloe Vera that are in it (once again another pleasant surprise), it was just too much for me to enjoy drinking, as i have an issue with things that are slightly slimy (I am a big texture person).<br /><br />  I would definitely purchase this though, and I would, in the future, most likely, drink it at room temperature or warm/hot (my husband preferred it cold, so its all a matter of personal taste I suppose!).  Of course, how you prefer to drink it is entirely up to you, but if you like the flavor passion fruit (and don't mind the slight taste of aloe and the slight slimy feel of aloe, the warmness helps with that though!) and like little chunks in what drink, along the lines of something like Bubble Tea (which I love!), then you may like this.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy"
I have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats!  I don't have to worry about them choking and I feel I am giving them a healthy treat!  Please don't ever stop making them Pet N Shape.
"There are quite a few coconut water products out there these days but this one is by far the best-tasting one I have tried.  Great balance of chocolate and coconut to be refreshing.  I add it to me post workout recovery after a strenuous long distance run or heavy weight lifting sessions.  Placebo effect or potassium effect, my recovery has been faster and I mentally feel better.  Great product!"
"I only order SF Bay Coffee (for my K-CUP machine at work), as the coffee is wonderfully fresh tasting and boasts a great filter base instead of the lame plastic cups used by all the other K-CUP companies. My favorites are the Fog Lifter and Rainforest Blend (organic). And what a tremendous, affordable price!"
Energy drinks are considerably higher price than coke/pepsi etc.  Your bang for your buck is here on a product that tastes very very much like Red Bull.  Not as much sugar as real RB as well :) Love IT!
"My wife and I love strong coffee, this and the jet fuel are our favorite! If you like strong coffee, give it a try....<br />Update to show how much we like it, I just placed our 3rd order in as many months."
Tastes great when you combine 1 pack of Twinings Green Tea and 1 pack of Lipton Black Tea in a hot cup of water and add 1 or more teaspoon of sugar. Make sure to remove the teabags from your cup within few minutes to avoid the strong bitter taste.
If you are looking for a great gluten free snack you won't be sorry you chose this product. My favorite flavor is the apple and nut.
"I am a big fan of flavored coffee. I enjoy the variety of hazelnut, caramel, butterscotch and at Christmas, candy cane and eggnog flavors. The French Toast coffee has an attractive smell and taste, and I enjoy it. Note that the strength is on the milder side so this is not a good choice for a wake-me-up jolt of caffeine."
"I make spice cookies rolled in pearl sugar.  I have a hard time finding pearl sugar in stores and when I do, it is expensive.  This is a very large jar that should easily last me a couple of Christmas seasons and it was less than half the price per ounce than my previous finds.  A good product and a good deal."
"We love Kind bars and regularly get about four of the varieties.  They are delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced on Amazon.  You pay a lot more for them in shops, that is, if you can find them.<br /><br />They also make great gifts, especially 'thank-you' gifts. I just sent two orders to my daughter and brother.<br /><br />We are delighted with the Amazon subscription program.  We automatically receive three different Kinds every two months, but if we run out, it is easy to get an extra order quickly. The service is excellent."
"Ordered first time, received a brick of cheese crackers with peanut butter. Amazon issued a refund and instructed me to reorder. Just received second order and it's the same . . . a big brick of peanut butter sandwich crackers. I'll just go to the grocery store next time."
"I have to say that although I'm not a big fan of Starbucks coffee since I find it too strong and sometimes having a burnt taste, I was pleasantly surprised with this vanilla flavored coffee, even though I don't normally care for a vanilla flavor in my coffee. I found both the vanilla scent and the flavor pretty natural and I would recommend it if you like flavored coffees, especially flavored with vanilla."
"I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again."
"I have 2 large dogs who are getting older and a little slower now, so I got these for them.  They will do just about anything for them.  I also have a small dog who is young and she wants them, too.  I like that there is nothing harmful in them and that they are a USA product.  It is a much more healthful treat and supplement than many that are available.  I will be buying these again."
"This is the perfect mid-afternoon snack. Slightly sweet, but mostly nuts and fruit. I'm getting coworkers hooked on KIND bars. Delicious!!"
"These are great treats, even for fussy dogs.  The glucosamine and chrondroitin realy do help older dogs with their joints."
"I expected Newman's Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, ""We are NOT eating this stuff.  Period.  No Way.""  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newman's in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But it's not Newman's."
"This is the best coffee I have ever had ... and I may not be a coffee expert, but I consider myself picky!  This is extremely smooth and flavorful.  I wish the price were lower & we had to sign for our package that came directly from Jamaica (hey, it is real!), but it is so worth the splurge!"
I had guests who really like these but I guess I am used to my peas being really hot.  I took a can and mixed it up with a package from Trader Joes.  Now those are hot!  I still think I'll continue to purchase these because others seem to really like it.  They thought these were hot enough.
"Great for the person who is on a diet.  Easy to mix, and the flavor is wonderful.  Can also be used in recipes.  Each serving is 45 calories, compared to 190 with real peanut butter."
My son takes a snack everyday and he loves the Kind Protein Bars.  They arrived very fast and a great deal!
"This tastes quite real for about 5 minutes, then dwindles to a wodge of sticky paper in your mouth. My least favorite of the series compared with the key lime, which last a long, long time."
"I have a seven year old gray tabby named Buddy.  I got him when he was three.  He is a very large cat, as the vet has a target weight for him at 18 pounds.  Unfortunately, he has been over 20 pounds since I got him.  While he is not fat, he is definitely in need of shedding a couple of pounds.<br /><br />I had always fed him dry cat food.  He was regularly eating Hill's Science Diet when I got him, and I was reluctant to change.  I thought that some of his minor health problems were just a part of having a cat around.  He tended to cough up massive hairballs, he would vomit stomach bile if he wasn't fed for more than a few hours, and his shedding was ridiculously constant.<br /><br />About six months ago, my vet recommended that I switch to canned food in an effor to keep his weight under control.  I quickly went out and bought a bunch of Hills Science Diet canned food, and he didn't like it very much. So I started to do a bit of research on what was the best food available for cats, and I was amazed at what I found.<br /><br />My research led me to Wellness, and I haven't looked back.  My cat has been eating mostly Wellness now for about three months.  No more hairballs.  No more stomach bile.  His shedding has been reduced drastically.  I have also noticed that his litter box doesn't smell nearly as bad, which I assume is the result of him not being chornically dehydrated from the dry food.  I've also noticed that he doesn't strain as hard to pass stool, which I'm sure he'd appreciate if he understood why.  But the most obvious change is my lethargic and overweight cat now jumps and runs around the house like he's lost three years in age, and he has indeed lost three pounds.  He was at the vet's target weight within a month of starting to eat Wellness, and he has maintained that weight for the past two months.<br /><br />The most important question, though, is how does he feel about it?  He loves it.  When I was feeding him Hill's, I would have to clean his bowl every time I fed him because he would leave pieces stuck to the side that would dry out like oatmeal.  With Wellness, he licks his bowl completely clean purring very loudly while he does it.  His favorite flavor is the chicken and salmon, but I can't stand the smell of the seafood.  So he gets his second favorite, chicken and beef.  He's not a big fan of the poultry only flavors, but he still likes them better than the Hill's he used to have to eat.<br /><br />A few days ago, I actually ran out of Wellness, and I fed him a can of Hill's to get by for the night until I could go buy more.  At 5:00 AM, I would up to the sound of my cat puking up stomach bile.<br /><br />From now on, it's Wellness or nothing."
"Good value, good quality and our dog absolutely loves it!  Hours and days of fun picking, chewing and playing!"
"Found a recipe for lavender lemonade and couldn't find cooking lavender anywhere, farmers markets, high end cooking boutiques, whole foods, etc.  This worked perfect, great price and fast shipper!"
"This coffee is just ok; personally I prefer Barrista Italian - it's just more robust.  Barrista may cost more, but the flavor is far superior to Tully's."
"I have been looking for Amazon to start carrying the Van Houtte K cups. I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program. Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied, smooth coffee. If you like Creme Brulee and you like coffee, you have to try this. You will not be disapointed."
"Santanders 53% semi-sweet dark chocolate bar is by far their best bar in my opinion. The 65% is pretty good also, but it's more smooth and balanced, whereas the 53% is just goodness from start to finish and has a wonderful creamy flavor.<br /><br />I've tried their 53%, 65%, 70% and also their espresso 70% one - the 53% is the best (by a long shot), then the 65% comes in 2nd place. The others are very good too, but don't quite have the amazing overall rich/creamy wonderfulness of the 53% bar.<br /><br />If you are not sure which bar to buy, the 53% bar is an excellent choice. If you like See's candy and/or Godiva, then you'll be right at home with this bar. It's one of the single best dark chocolate bars I have ever had in my life."
"I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really can't make out any carmel flavor."
"I had these sweet-looking little air plants sent to my friends house. It arrived quickly and when she opened them, they were very healthy! They also had a nice touch of color on them as well. Only a small hint of red, but she is already starting to see a little more red stripes. If your looking for a nice bunch of air-plants, look no further!"
"We recently purchased the 2 lb. bag of Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix and when we received it the bag was sealed. While serving pancakes to my family I bit into some crunchy pieces and immediately thought ""oh I must have accidentally dropped an eggshell into the batter."" After biting into another crunchy bit and then getting a jab in my mouth it dawned on me (duh) that all I added was water. I immediately told the family to stop eating!  I investigated further to find large shards of glass in the pancakes (two of them 3/4 of an inch long).  The measuring cup that I used was metal and the only glass in the process was the mixing bowl which after careful examination revealed no signs of chipping and it wasn't broken - it was fully intact.  I poured a cup of the dry mix from the original bag into a sieve and found pieces of glass - including small chunks (1-2mm in size) as well as additional shards.  I then contacted Continental Mills (the company who makes Krusteaz) as well as the FDA.  Let me be clear on something - I have no interest in any sort of legal action - I simply wanted to be heard.  Other than that I suppose that I wanted to hear them apologize.  I thought that was fair especially after I just served glass to my 1, 3, and 7 year old courtesy of Continental Mills.  The FDA was great - saying that they log complaints like this in order to agglomerate data to look for trends. THEY even apologized that I had encountered that problem.  Continental Mills immediately told me that it was impossible for there to be glass in the mix but they would send me a packet to send the Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix back to them for analysis.  I just received the reply stating that they did in fact find glass in the mix but ""were unable to identify it as coming from our facility."" They also included a $0.30 off coupon for Krusteaz products. I find their response to be absolutely unacceptable.  I am left with the belief that they do not care about quality nor the safety of their customers.  The glass came from somewhere - either from their facility or one of the suppliers that provides them with salt, baking soda, etc...<br />I recommend that you avoid this product for your safety and the safety of your family."
"One of the best tomato/pasta sauces I have ever purchased, worth the price compared to cheap supermarket brands.  Tasty, healthy, buy the six pack from Amazon or direct from Boves of Vermont.  I'm going to have some right now mmm...."
"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!"
"Some time ago I overhauled my dogs' diet after learning that the so-called ""premium"" brand I had been feeding them had by-products and other undesirable ingredients. One of my dogs is a little fussy and it was hard to find something else he liked. We finally settled on this brand. I like that you can actually see some of the vegetables and fruits that are mixed in, there are no by-products and it's less expensive than some of the other natural and organic brands."
"Tastes great and satisfies my hunger. I am currently on a fitness diet and I don't feel guilty when I am eating one of these.  Since there are no ""melty"" ingredients, it stays in tact in hot cars, at beaches etc which is an added bonus.  I took a star off because the calorie count is a bit high, but I chalk that up to the great taste and the fact that it fills you up."
Decided to try these as a shortcut in recipes.  Won't be buying again.  I'll stick to creating my own spice mix at home.
"I tried several brands of coffee before settling on this one.  There's a lot of taste and almost no bitterness with this blend, and I've been quite happy with it.  I usually tend toward the quite dark, expresso roasts, but I've been finding that the bitterness in the followthrough has been ruining things for me.  If you like Starbucks, you will probably not like this coffee - but I gave up Starbucks as overly roasted (burned, really) and sour years ago.  This coffee is smooth with lots of taste, but easy drinking enough for multiple cups.  I usually can't drink coffee black, because I make it strong, but I can drink this black without any problems.  I'm quite impressed with the product, and with Ship and Save, it's even more attractive."
"Delivery came within days of ordering.  Xcell Funnel Cake Mix tastes EXACTLY like the carnival funnel cakes...  and was exactly what I was hoping for!!!  My kids and their friends loved it!!!  (And, so did I!!)"
I use it to put in a protein shake. One scoop that's all it takes. Less calories than others. It is very reasonable ! I will buy again !
These cups are excellent.  They are my favorite cups.  I recommend them to anyone who likes this sort of thing.
"This is a good mild to medium morning coffee. We offer this as an option in the office, along w/Peet's dark roast, and Kreugers flavored single serve. The short of it is that if they don't like it, they don't drink, and this pot is always empty. I'd compare it to Starbucks and Peets mild+ blends. The order was recieved (as I recall) promptly, and the expiration date on the vacuum sealed pkg was 78 days out from receipt date."
I ordered these Lorna Doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area. I even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either. You should try them. They taste great without the extra junk in them.  My kids love them 2 :)
"As the prior reviews noted, full-bodied, confident coffee that's offers great flavor without acidity or bitterness.<br /><br />Can't understand why it's not more popular.  Target/SuperTarget used to carry SBC coffees but Starbucks must be pushing their Starbucks-brand coffee as SBC disappeared from Target/big boxes/major grocery stores in the Chicago area.<br /><br />I'd buy these beans from the Borders Cafes but each bag runs approx. $12 v. the $6-ish formerly at Target."
"Too risky for me, so I never ate this stuff and threw it out. Lesson learned: if the ingredients are not listed here on Amazon, check another website for the ingredients BEFORE buying the product.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Corn syrup, sugar, cream, coconut and other natural flavors, carrageenan, propylene glyrol, alginate, soy lecithin, vanilla, white food coloring (titanium dioxide), salt, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum. Processed in a facility that uses nuts. Keep refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because the product did arrive quick."
These were about the same price I would get them in the grocery store and I got free shipping by ordering other things.  They arrived in a timely fashion and my yellow lab was delighted to see them!  They are one of his favorite treats.
"After ordering this starter about a month ago, I was able to get it very active within 3 days. The instructions are easy to follow. I devided my starter fairly quickly into 3 experiments. One part is in the fridge, I feed it weekly, works great. One part got left inside the oven with the light on for a consistent source of warmth, the other part sits on my counter. The temp in my house is between 65 and 70 degrees. The starter on the counter top is working the fastest, after I feed it it bubbles well within 3 hours. After forming my loaves it takes them 2-3 hours to proof or rise to the desired volume. The taste is great... So far I am only making white sourdough bread, in order to perfect my loaves. I also bake about every other day, because I want my starter to gain more character and sourness. I give a lot of loaves to friends, and they love them!<br />Before I bought this starter I had tried a different brand which I had bought in a grocery store. That one did not work out at all, it actually stank. So I am very happy this brand worked out so well!<br />A great many books have been written on sourdough. Yes, its science, but if you follow just a few basic rules this type of baking is cheap and easy. Don't hesitate to try this starter, I don't think you will have any regrets!"
These are great snacks for the everyone. They taste great! they are great to have in your purse and kids love them.
"Hello!<br /><br />I used the Organic Maple Syrup grade B for a lemon detox that I use to loose weight and to clean my system.<br /><br />I recommend this product, this is a reliable vendor as well. I submitted my order and in less than 5 days I received my product and began doing my detox.<br /><br />If want to use the product and research the lemon detox master cleanser and you will see that the main ingredient for the detox is this great Organic Maple Syrup Grade level B.<br /><br />Good luck!!"
I ordered a case of this peanut butter in chocolate and regular.  The chocolate has a funny taste and it's going to waste.  The original is pretty good but too salty.  I won't order this again.
"If you suffer high blood pressure these MAY cause you to have issues, I don't mess around when I say it. So be forewarned, while I am young and don't have any blood pressure issues I know others that have. So keep this in mind that the salt content is a little extreme.<br /><br />The chips are good, not potatoe-y tasting, though. Taste like a pringle feels like a starchy corn chip.<br /><br />And here is some information about their newly added flavor, Jalapeno, I have received the ingredient list for everybody here to examine before purchasing since it is currently hard to find..<br /><br />---JALAPENO INGREDIENTS----<br /><br />NATURAL POTATO INGREDIENTS (POTATO FLAKES, POTATO STARCH), SUNFLOWER,<br />SAFFLOWER, AND/OR CANOLA OIL, JALAPENO SEASONING (DEHYDRATED VEGETABLES,<br />[GREEN BELL PEPPER, PARSLEY, GARLIC, ONION, GREEN ONION], SALT, SUGAR,<br />MALTODEXTRIN, RICE FLOUR, CITRIC ACID, JALAPENO PEPPER, YEAST EXTRACT,<br />TORULA YEAST, SPICE, NATURAL FLAVOR), RICE FLOUR, JALAPENO PEPPER EXTRACT,<br />SALT.<br /><br />-------------------------"
we switched to this dog food when the scare with gluten happened several years ago.. Our dog just loves the venison. he doesnt poop as much and he is a spitball of energy. even at 7yrs old and a big dog of 100 pounds he acts like he is still a puppy..
"as far as gluten free products go - these aren't bad.  seems like nothing is really ""good"" so the best you can hope for is not terribly unpalatable."
"Not sure why but the texture bothered me with these, the smoothness of the straws is weird. And they have very little substance and taste. The upside is there are a lot in the bag so I guess if you eat them all, you feel like you had a snack. They're just not for me :("
"When you need something to clear the cobwebs in your head, Victorian Inn Instant Cappuccino Mocha - two spoons and one spoon of hazelnut (or another flavor of your choice) into a cup of hot water does the trick.  Lately I have added Nestle Coffee-mate Peppermint Mocha for a little extra special flavor.  Amazon does a great job with their automatic refill of your order.  Amazon notifies you ahead of shipment for the option to change, delay or delete your order. With confirmation, your order is shipped and you know exactly when to expect delivery.  Great Service !!!"
This is the very best super dark chocolate I've ever tasted.<br />I snack on a square or two in the afternoon and because the quality is so good... you only need a taste!
"I just love all the granola bars from Granola Gourmet.  I met the founders of the company at our local Farmer's Market and have really enjoyed talking to them about how the company started, etc.  Any of the flavors they offer are really wonderful, each with their own unique and satisfying flavor.<br /><br />I like to use these healthy bars for my mid-morning snack or when I go for an extended walk on the weekends.  I try to be careful to eat healthy foods, and do not like the usual ""energy bars"" that are glorified candy bars and not as tasty or healthy for you as they would like you to think.  These bars really are healthy, taste great and they provide just the right amount of energy I need, plus they leave me feeling satisfied.<br /><br />I cannot ask for more in a snack bar, and I wish to highly recommend them to anyone looking to find a healthy energy bar to get them through the day or to include with their workout, camping or even backpacking trips."
"I don't use small cans like Fancy Feast, so I cannot comment on those. However, I like these because they LAST. I bought them at a pet food store which no longer carries them, probably because they are so expensive.<br /><br />Except for a lid I bought at least 15 years ago labelled Sargeant's, these are the sturdiest. The more flimsy ones always end up getting a crack in them and are not always tight.<br /><br />For me, the 4 stars, not 5, is because they seem expensive. However, on Amazon, it seems that most of the can covers are more expensive than you would want to pay. It's the S & H that is outrageous."
I just bought this exact same box of cat food today at Grocery Outlet for $3.99. You might want to check around and compare.
"I figured a 450-mile mid-August motorcycle ride would be a good way to evaluate Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, so I poured a bottle of it into my CamelBak and set off from my home in northeast Arkansas for Indianapolis and the MotoGP races last Thursday morning.<br />The stuff kept me well hydrated and clear-headed all the way to Indy, which was a very good thing because we were overtaken by torrential rains just as we reached the city and had to negotiate flooding streets and rush-hour traffic to reach our motel, which wasn't where we remembered it because the interchange has been reconfigured.<br />Throughout it all, I never felt the ""out of it"" fatigue that goes with dehydration on a hot day. It's also easier on my stomach than regular tap water or ordinary bottled water.<br />Essentia will be my water of choice for future hot weather rides."
Easy to prepare.  Just take the Chicken Kiev out of the box an bake for 35 to 45 minutes to serve a tasty meal.
"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!"
"We drank it, we liked it. I didn't really notice if the low acid made a different, but it seemed good so if its low acid it must be better then regular. Tastes good."
"I got hooked on these in Hong Kong where my American candy choices were Starburst and Skittles, both sugar rushes of the extreme sort.  This candy is not as sweet as those, but a bit sweeter than most Asian candy (many of my Chinese friends find it too sweet for their taste, but many of my American friends say it is not sweet enough).  I kind of like the middle ground, trying to cut back on my sugars."
"This product is a VERY light roast.  I suppose my not being such a huge fan of this product is due to my own poor research prior to ordering, but I doubt I'll purchase this item again.  The coffee is *ok* but definitely nothing I'm doing backflips over.  The body is far lighter than I would've anticipated or desired.  The aroma isn't bad, though I can't say it seems as fresh as would be desired, either.  All together I'd say this was decidely mediocre.<br /><br />I should also include, though, that I use a Keurig coffee maker, with one of the refill-able baskets (I love the k-cup varieties, but they get to be too expensive for every day use, when you consume as much coffee as I do).  Perhaps this would be a more enjoyable blend if used in a traditional coffee pot, where you have the ability to overload the filter with grounds.  That being said, clearly this is not the coffee for me."
"Reading some of the other reviews... I'm not alone in using these beans for making ""regular coffee"" (not espresso process).  This coffee is awesome; it has a nice, strong (yet smooth) flavor.  Definitely consider giving it a try."
"They shipped quinoa GRAIN instead of quinoa flakes. Too bad I found out about it too late... I did not finish my quinoa flakes when I was ordering more, so I did not bother to open a 25lb bag until 2.5 months later. Well, fortunately, it is not a complete waste... in my home quinoa grain goes 10X faster than quinoa flakes."
"This coffee has all the taste, rich, not too bold, smooth. I appreciate that is is less caffeine as I tend to drink coffee throughout the day and could do with a lot less caffeine. We grind most our own coffee & I have found it tastes best not mixed with other coffee beans or other coffee grounds."
"I've found Kernal Seasons in different flavors in the grocery store but never saw the Jalepeno flavor until going to a movie theater where they had different seasonings to add to your bag.  Loved it.  Looked all over our city in the stores for this and finally gave up and ordered it off Amazon.  A little pricier, but a good deal on shipping helped.  It's worth it.  I love this stuff on popcorn, baked potatoes, etc.  The nice thing about getting 6 shakers is that I can share!"
The coffee doesn't have any major bitter taste and doesn't taste like it has chemicals in it either.  Very nice coffee with a little bit of cream.  I will be purchasing this one again.
"I can't argue with my kitties. They would eat only this type of food if I would let them. Kibbles are a must, but they share one can twice daily. They look forward to this early AM and late evening treat.<br />They are not partial to any flavor but texture and gravy count. They let me kow by how much they leave in their bowls.  For the ""Grilled"" food there are no leftovers, but ""Classic"" is not as good.<br /><br />I am just the messenger for ""Grateful Pampered""  kitties."
"Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill."
"this crusting for chicken is really good.  I used bone in chicken thighs.  Rinsed and coated pieces and baked at 400 for 50 minutes.  I could only cover 6 medium sized thighs with the amount of mix provided in one box.  It crisped the chicken up nicely and the breading has a light flavor to it, kinda plain but good."
"I love this product!  When the company stop selling it in the stores, I was very upset and thought I would never have another cup, but then I found out I could purchase it through Amazon and I'm hooked again.<br />You can adjust the taste to your desire, a little sweet or very sweet and there is no foam as with the other chai tea products.  The pack of 6 is very economical and usually lasts me for about 4 months."
"I absolutely LOVE these bars. They are wonderful for an afternoon snack...and the added protein keeps me satisfied for the rest of the afternoon.  I am lactose intolerant and can't eat eggs, and I have no problem with these bars at all. They taste great and are very satisfying.<br />If you like dark chocolate, and want a slightly crunchy texture, you'll love these!"
"My dog is very picky about her food, treats, etc.  Other powdered medicines sprinkled on her food she generally refuses to eat.  However, this one is an exception.  Either she doesn't know it's there or doesn't mind it/the taste.<br /><br />This does seem to help her mobility as well, but I also supplement this with glucosomine treats and food containing some glucosomine, so I'm not sure how much of an impact it really has.  It definitely doesn't have any adverse effects on her mobility or diet, so based on her taking to the powder and its perceived effects, I'd recommend this to prospective buyers."
"I'm on my second box of 150 of Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso pods.  I use them on my ""Handpresso"" machine, for which they are perfect. Lavazza produces a great crema, and I love the taste.  Will continue to purchase."
This mac and cheese is not only great tasting but it does not have all the junk that other products have. One time eating it and I was hooked.
I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.
A classic...just like I remember them.  These are a little too hot for me but my husband loves them. He takes them to work and his coworkers like to grab one as they walk by his desk.
"We buy the Happy Hips treats for our 14-year old Husky.  He LOVES them and they're great if you need to tuck in a pill for an easy medication dose.  Best of all, the treats contain glucosamine and chondroitin so movement improves over time."
"I just bought a jar of this stuff on a whim last night, despite its $8 price tag and boy am I glad I did.  I've never truly liked Peanut Butter, in fact I loathed it for many years...but as my tastebuds matured I learned to tolerate it once in a while with chocolate or apple slices.  I've been searching for a common ground because my BF LOVES peanut butter, but only the ""kid"" kinds...loaded with sugar and hydrogenated oils.  I like the fact that nut butters can be healthy and satisfy the appetite but I just couldn't deal with the Jif any longer. :)  Well, I've found our compromise... Barney Butter is ever so slightly sweet (just enough, I think) and close enough in taste to PB that my BF likes it, yet it's missing that indefinable something that makes me dislike peanut butter so much.  Plus, the Barney Butter is WAY healthier... compare the nutritional info  on the jar of Barney Butter to your standard jar of Jif or Skippy.  I know it isn't quite as pure as some nut butters since this still contains palm oil, BUT all of the No-Stir nut butters contain palm oil...it's a compromise I can live with if it means not having to stir anything with the consistency of cement... that just too much work for a sandwich.  Anyhoo..this stuff is fabulous and I can't keep my spoon out of the jar!!!  I was very glad to see the 3-pack on Amazon.  I'm ordering it right now!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  My initial enthusiasm for Barney Butter has not waned.  Peanut Butter has never made it back into our house since.  I use the Barney Butter in baked goodies, candies, smoothies, on toast, and on plain old spoons :).  I actually buy 6 jars at a time from Amazon.  LOVE IT!"
Went to a local sushi joint where they serve this kind of tea and fell in love with it. Bought some here on Amazon and now I can have it whenever I want it! The roasted brown rice gives the green tea a richer flavor that I can enjoy before bedtime.
"I like the portion size on this one.  Son started eating this at 5 1/2 months.  No issue with feeding him cold or hot he eats it.  I like the benefits of DHA and I like the listed Vegetables/Grains.<br /><br />I like the pricing, no tax, and free shipping to my door.  Can't beat the price for pack of 8 in the stores.  we get this food delivered too.<br /><br />The packs are easy to throw in diaper bag w/spoon and feed him.  Less mess and fuss.<br /><br />Our son's 11 months now and still eats this."
"Title says it all. Spreadable, melty, Cadbury's Chocolate. Absolutely wonderful! Jar is kinda small for the price, but being in the USA, it's not something that's readily available in most stores here. Lasts quite a while, makes an excellent dip for fresh apple slices and pineapple spears!!"
"I was looking for a tasty cracker that would go well with hummus or cheese or dip. These things taste like cardboard and turn to sticky glue after one bite. They have no flavor whatsoever. Not even salt or a good dip could save these molded wheat flour stamps. And if you think they're healthy, you're wrong: the main ingredient is ""enriched wheat flour"", which is basically sugar. Fritos are better for you than this."
"I prefer the taste of energy drinks, but only drink 1 or 2 a week because of all the sugar and calories.  The sugar free energy drinks just dont taste as good.  I use a 5 hour energy on the days i dont drink an energy drink.  I dont like coffee at all, so this gives me the boost i need to be awake and functional at work in the mornings.  The taste of 5 hour isnt amazing, but it doesnt need to be since it is a small shot of it.  It gives me energy and has very few calories, I am very happy with the product"
"These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients."
"I bought these as a thank you gift for a friend. They arrived quickly, and I loved that I could track the package at every step along the way. My friend loved them so much. They're vibrant purple and arrived fresh and in great condition. Highly recommended for the great value and quality. So much better than 1-800-Flowers or the other big competitors."
"I'm not the biggest chicken fan, but a friend of mine, Chef Mike,<br />of West Creek, NJ ...barbecued chicken for the first time ...<br />Matter-of-fact, he cremated it and was about to throw all 6lbs.<br />out ...  Luckily, I took a bite before it hit the garbage bin.<br /><br />And From this point, I was addicted. Chef Mike made all the mistakes<br />that day of a beginning barbecue novice. He didn't marinate the chicken,<br />just slapped it on the chicken and threw it on the grill (low settings).<br />He turned the chicken 4 times. The skin was blackened ... charred ...<br />but the taste, at least to me, was addicting, out of this world.<br /><br />He made the same chicken for my visit last week the exact same way<br />because I raved about his recipe (remember, I'm not a big chicken eater)<br /> .... Again ... Totally blackened on the outside, perfectly cooked inside.<br />NO raw,rubbery taste.<br /><br />I went to my mom's this weekend. We tried to replicate Chef Mike's chicken.<br />We used a generic ShopRite Barbecue sauce. No way. It wasn't the same. After<br />three pieces, I had had it (and so did everyone else).<br /><br />I guess this sauce, General Tso's, along with the blackened flavor is what gave<br />Mike's chicken that unique, addicting taste, one of a kind, taste sensation (I<br />ate 5 lbs of chicken myself, at one sitting).<br /><br />Give it a try ... and if you like the really like the flavor of<br />sizzling grilled chicken .. try a piece or two... and if you get hooked,<br />make sure you invite me over for your next grilling !"
"After eating the Roasted Honey Nut peanuts and nuts for the past couple years I thought I would give Skippy Peanut Butter, Roasted Honey Nut Super Chunk a try. All I can say is that I have been missing a great tasting chunky peanut butter during this time period. It not only has a great taste but also this chunky peanut butter spreads easily for the size and quanity of the peanut chunks in the peanut butter. Now I will have to order the Skippy Peanut Butter Roasted Honey Nut Creamy Style for the family members who prefer the creamy style over the chunky style. Naturally I will have to give it a taste test too!!"
"I usually love french vanilla coffee, but this one is horrible.  Even the smell gets to me, it really does smell similar to a chemical smell.  I am disappointed in tassimos selection lately.  They got rid of Starbucks and they don't have hardly any acceptable flavored coffee.  I think my machine may be ending up on ebay and I may make the switch to Keurig...they have Dunkin Donuts!"
"This is a lovely rooibos.  I love rooibos, but it is so expensive compared to common black teas!<br />This brand gives you a lot of bang for your buck, so I ordered it.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is a very fine tasting rooibos tea.  I read a review here that said it was weak.  I did not find that so.  What I always do with rooibos is steep it for a full 10 minutes, then squeeze out the tea bag with the back of a spoon pressed against the inside of the cup.  I did so with this brand, and it was just fine.<br /><br />I'll definitely be a repeat customer.  A very nice cup of tea indeed."
"Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you don't like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you won't like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesn't taste extra bold.  It's almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger."
"This mix is exactly as advertised . I Decided to add chopped onion ,sesame seeds and a small amount of Chile paste and  the results were outstanding . I also used .75 lbs of Ahi instead of the full LB. and it worked fine .I would buy this product again ."
"For those of us brought up on Vegemite, Marmite doesn't make the grade.  For those brought up on Marmite, Vegemite seems a poor substitute.  For Americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake (oops, I mean ""bread"") both are revolting.<br /><br />I think that a major reason why Americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast, they tend to use like quantities of Vegemite or Marmite.  To uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming.  Before passing judgment on these spreads, you would do well to heed the advice of ""Joanna"" or ""mtspace"" and apply thinly. It also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast.<br /><br />Incidentally, I believe that Marmite was first.  Vegemite was an Australian imitation created several years later.  It was originally called Parwill - a pun which will be appreciated by Aussies and Brits but which may not be understood by Americans because of the way the words are pronounced.<br /><br />I only give Marmite four stars.  That probably tells you my upbringing."
"I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.  I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods.  It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.  You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones.  I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!"
"Previously I bought the Teeccino Mediterranean Vanilla Nut and it was okay, but a little sweet for me, but then I purchased this Maya French Roast (because of a previous review) and I'm really glad I bought it. This tastes so much like coffee. I avoid coffee and decaf coffee because of the caffeine. So now I can drink all Teeccino I like."
"This pizza sauce is delicious. I happened upon it at a local store, and I bought all they had. Of course, they no longer carry it, so I am so thankful I found it on Amazon. Yum!"
Bigelow's Vanilla Caramel tea is not only delicious is smells heavenly.  Whenever i drink it at work people stop by to see where the wonderful aroma is coming from. The flavor is pleasant and delicate.  I find it relaxing.  I also drink it when I am hungry and on a diet as it makes me feel satisfied as if I had a treat.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
Awesome!!! It only took a couple of days to receive my order. I will be definetly ordering more items from this company.
I love these pretzels!! The taste like real pretzels! Glutino is a great brand and I buy many of their products. Anything time I am trying a new alternative to a gluten-containing food and a Glutino product is available I always start with them!!
"Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored. Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, acidic, or just ordinary. We have found OUR FAVORITE with this one. It's strong, flavorful, and smooth. Comes exactly as described by the seller, order promptly processed, arrives quickly. Can't beat it in our opinion. I can recommend this coffee and the seller with confidence."
"I make a ""jug"" of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day.  I'm delighted to find a source in the US as it was introduced to me in B.C.  It does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy."
"All the KIND bars I have tried have been great and all of them tasted yummy, but almond coconut is by far the best. It's like eating candy, or those samoa girl scout cookies. Very good and the bars work great for those times you need to be tied over until your next meal."
"This is my new favorite tea. It's got a fantastic taste and smell! It's unlike any other tea I've had, and different from any other bedtime tea as well. It's got a hint of sweetness to it, like honey. It's soothing and delicious. I was so happy to find this!"
"I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80-90% the same taste. The pink/red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black/green olives, sudjook, and much more. If you come accross Turkish from brands other than Caykur, try to choose Caykur brand."
"this product is great the smell was bad but over all it was great. the baby sleeps much better, no gas."
"I received a box of Numi Gunpowder Green Tea from a friend for my birthday. When I got sick, I decided to switch to green tea from coffee. I'm sorry now that I waited so long! Green tea works just as well to keep me awake and has fewer undesirable side effects (such as perspiration). I've switched!"
"I won't say that this is the best, others like The Republic of Tea are much better, but also more expensive. Relative to price you simply cannot beat this tea."
"I saw all the problems people were having with damaged cans but the sale price was too good to pass up.  I ordered two cases.  First case, not even a little dent.  Second case, bashed to heck.  Obviously not Amazon's fault since the boxes they arrived in were fine.  Farmer's Market really needs to figure out what is going on in their packing department!"
"After Altoids made the silly business decision to no longer produce their version of a cinnamon gum (which, in my opinion at the time, was the best on the market), I had to look for another alternative.  I found a worthy substitute with Stride Sweet Cinnamon gum.  Tastes great.  The flavor lasts as long as it should and it doesn't turn into a rock within the first few minutes of chewing.  Nicely done.  Stride:  stay in business!"
"I love KIND bars; yummy, relatively few ingredients, gluten free, lower in sugar -- and definitely get a break on the price with the box deal!!"
"I put this out for my friends at a house party to use with chicken and hamburgers.  Needless to say it was gone by the end of the night.  Amazing flavor, can't recommend this enough."
"My little boy likes it very much. It is made from organic whole grains and has DHA, probiotics and good protein content per calorie. Good product."
"Soft, not rock hard, not going to pull out my tooth fillings!<br /><br />I have never tasted such amazing wonderful magnificent licorice! Anything else , is not true licorice! This may be a bit ""strong"" of flavor if one is used to the nasty corn syrup watered down no flavor kind of candy. I very much feel this is TRUE licorice....<br /><br />this is made with wheat ... Wheat and flavor (natural herbs?) natural oils... GOOD stuff, instead of that icky sticky awful corn syrup stuff. My mouth feels clean after this Anise (?) licorice, unlike other candy.<br /><br />This contains wheat. (I have wheat ""SENSITIVITIES""  however, I feel no sedative clogging fatigue depressed ""sensitivity"" issues, as , it seems to pass all too quickly. Heh. It seems that if one eats an entire bag (bags) of ANY LICORICE as one serving (3 or more, more, more""servings per package"") that some people could experience less desirable results in the lower GI tract. Just , ah, words of advice, as this Finland licorice is just THAT good, and THAT enticing.... ; P  Try not to eat the entire bag! or two bags! This actually HELPS ,naturally, motivates my lower GI tract, so no worries. heh.sorry. Maybe some folks might find this helpful information. EWwww. sorry."
I received a jar of Fire Balls as a gift and it made me realize how much I like them....so I ordered some more.  These are not that hot.  It takes several minutes in your mouth to get any cinnamon/fire flavor. You can also bite these and they crumble...<br /><br />I wouldn't buy these again.
"It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal. I'm a little torn on what I think of packages like this - I am glad they are BPA free, and they are convenient for when we're out and about, but in general I prefer glass containers that we can recycle or reuse."
"If you want a quick cup of coffee that is simply the best, this is it! I have had other pod coffees all with a bitter aftertaste. I love love love this brand. You simply can not go wrong with any of the Gevalia flavors."
"I love spaghetti.  This was one of the better canned or microwavable spaghetti I've had.  Not as good as home cooked, but better than most of the precooked spaghettis."
"Very expensive, all TAZO tea products are between 3 and 5 dollars in all the stores, . I bought the sampler box by 10.5$ and suppose to be on sale. I found it at walmart by 3.5 dollars and at target by 3 dollars. It was very frustrating to me. I felt that I been robbed.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN1F"">Tazo Assorted Tea Sampler, 24 Tea Bags</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN1F"">Tazo Assorted Tea Sampler, 24 Tea Bags</a>"
"The most delicious almond butter ever!  So much better than any other almond butter that I have ever had.  My local store stopped stocking it, so now I'm buying it online because I can't bear to go without it."
"I enjoy the many varieties of crisp bread, but always come back to Siljans for the taste and texture. If you like crisp bread but never tried Siljans, you are missing out.  Admittedly, the package size is a bit awkward to stash somewhere, but that is part of the unique charm of this brand."
"I've tried Lavazza Caffe Espresso and Crema e Gusto. Rossa tastes like middle of these.<br /><br />Crema e Gusto is the cheapest so if it tastes ok i wanted to go with it. however, it has bitter and acid aftertaste. And this acid make my stomach growling. I had that growling with Caffe Espresso but with Rossa, never experienced it."
"If you like spicy food, this hot sauce is actually a great way to spice things up. I wouldn't recommended eating it straight unless you're doing it as a challenge, but I would just mix it in with other sauces. The taste is surprisingly good! The spice kicks pretty fast. Awesome product, and I would buy again. Definitely not recommended for those who can't take any spiciness at all. They will literally scream in pain. I would know, I gave my friend a drop of it and he was running for the milk!"
"Superb balance. Great lingering sweetness, not at all harsh, moderate brightness. Essentially everything that I search for in an espresso. The bean aroma is very sweet with hints of hazelnut shells. The roast is lighter than most of the Lavazza blends (although it was darker that the Tierra I tried) and much lighter than the beans you would find used in a popular America coffee franchise. In my opinion, this is what really lets this coffee shine, complementing the deep caramels with its restrained brightness and giving way to fruity notes.<br /><br />One very important note: do not simply seal this coffee in the can with the lid after you use it. The can is not airtight, and my first can was stale overnight. I thought that my barista skills were steadily declining, but when I opened the second can the difference in flavor and aroma were astounding. Place it immediately into an airtight container and use within a week. Too bad that this coffee is so expensive, or I would be pulling shots with it all the time. If you've never tried it, splurge a little. It will be memorable."
This grade B has much richer maple flavor than any grade A that I have tasted.  Quite a treat with the weekend family breakfast.  Highly recommend.
"I have these on subscription so I never run out. The flavor is fantastic, and the packaging makes them convenient to use often. They don't contain hormones or antibiotics which makes them much better than canned broth from the grocery store. They don't have to be refrigerated until they're opened, but they're packaged in 8 oz. containers so I rarely use less than a whole one. They're an outstanding base for soups, dumplings, gravies and sauces."
"Madame X is right.  I made many, many Tiramisus over the past years and always used German or Italien 'Loeffelbisquits' until my Italian colleague recommended Pavesini.  At first I was concerned as they are so flat.  Not to worry, they are perferct, I make four instead of two layers now and they do not become as soggy with the Expresso as the bisquits.  Best Tiramisu ever!"
"I love these; a low calorie way to get that ""barbeque potato chip"" taste. Still somewhat high in sodium, but healthier than regular chips. You really do get that barbeque potato chip taste! If you are trying to eat healtier or lose weight this may satisfy your ""potato chip craving"".  I really like the barbeque flavor. Great single serving for portion control. (It's easy to eat too many chips without knowing it!)"
"This cake is light, fluffy, and chocolatey. We nuke one before any birthday party, so that my celiac son has his own safe cake. I just top it with some buttercream from the freezer or frosting from a can, but this company sells frosting packets that are really good too. Be sure to put the frosting on while it's warm and let it melt a bit, because the cakes are very delicate. I sprinkle them with colored sprinkles, too."
"Postum is a wheat/grain coffee substitute.  When I was a child, my parents used to let me drink Postum while they had their coffee.  I still love the taste of it--similar to coffee but unique. I enjoy it in the evening when it's too late for ""real"" coffee.  I can purchase Postum in my local grocery store.  I purchased the Postum from Amazon for my sister, who has moved to Tennessee where Postum is not available in the grocery store.  She was ecstatic when she received the Postum I purchaed through Amazon.com."
"I am a diabetic and need to increase my fiber content daily. I am eating Multi-Bran Chex daily and I really, really like them a lot. Being able to purchase from Amazon is incredible since no store locally carries them any more. Thank you Amazon for giving me this opportunity."
I make my version of parsley stew with this and it turns out great. I wish they would make one without fenugreek. I am not a big fan of that even though it is authentic for this Persian stew.
Just put those in the fridge and have them with your coffee - nothing beats that
"I love these bars.  I basically live off of them.  HOWEVER, this is now the second time that I have ordered them from Amazon where the internal boxes of bars have had bugs in them.  They looked somewhat like ants, but I wasn't sure what they were.  Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box.  I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package.  My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food. Gross, gross, gross.  So unhappy because other than that, these bars are great.  But I will never order them online from Amazon again.  Thank g-d Trader Joes and Ralphs are starting to carry this brand."
"I expected 100% hibiscus, but was very happy with my purchase and now have it on auto-delivery. I paid big bucks in the past for a blend of hibiscus tea at Teavana. This tea is just as good, if not better. Hibiscus, orange peel, and cinnamon lower high blood pressure. I add a small piece of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VVHIJ6"">Needle Ku Ding Tea</a> to the mix and a dash more cinnamon when brewing. The needle ku ding has a very bitter taste so a little goes a long way. I am 100% pleased with this product and the results I have gotten with my customized blend."
Order came quickly with a large variety of flavors to try and at least two of each flavor (so you don't have to share your cup).
Shipped was fast and as described :-)  Was nice to to find a product that is not available here and also have the option to combine items ...
"I love the taste of these candies. They have a hard outer shell that tastes like a butter toffee and a liquid honey center. I wanted to try one in the afternoon when I was really dragging at the end of a work day (4:30 - 5:00 is when my energy seems to be at its lowest). While I really enjoyed eating the lozenge, I didn't notice any burst or spark of energy. Nothing compared to a cup of coffee or tea. I did only eat one and not three consecutively, so maybe if I had eaten more I would have felt the charge. My grandchildren all loved them and hey, there's nothing wrong with candy that contains some vitamins. I didn't have a sore throat, but I bet they would be soothing because of the honey and vitamins. I would order these again; not for the energy aspect but the delightful taste."
"Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good."
"There is the taste of salt, caramel and apple in this.  The salt taste ruins the apple and caramel flavor.  It is overpowering!"
"I only bought this because the breeder where I bought my cat said she wouldn't eat anything else. I'm surprised my cat didn't starve to death, because she wouldn't touch this stuff, nor would my other cat. I donated it to the Humane Society."
"The product, Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple and Brown Sugar, was extremely sweet.  Way too much sugar taste.  I could even taste salt?  I could not taste the oats due to the high sugar content.  The product was mixed with 1/2 cup boiling water per the instructions.  UPC 30000 26190."
"We had pancakes from this mix this AM.  Used eggwhites instead of whole eggs, because that's all we had.  Otherwise followed the package directions exactly.<br /><br />They were good.  They were a bit grainy but light and fluffy.  They browned nicely and cut well.  Mine had a tendency to fall apart when picked up with a fork, but not badly.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Bisquik Gluten Free for pancakes.<br /><br />If I couldn't get Bisquik GF, I wouldn't mind these at all."
"A good cup of tea in the afternoon to me is a bit of heaven.  My old standby for years has been Tetley's British Blend.  I then spent a month in Egypt, where they love their tea.  I came away craving Lipton Yellow Label loose tea, which seemed to be a favorite in Egypt.  The Yellow Label's a bit on the strong side so I usually add a bit of sugar.  Then one day,I found a unopened pouch of Taylor's Pure Assam Tea on the window sill.  My wife goes out with her girl friends to these decadent over priced tea houses where they have tea, sweets and plenty of gossip.  Well the pouch of Taylors had arrived via one of those tea houses.  Actually it had been on that window sill for at least a month before I somehow of other decided to try it.  Boy, talk about surprised, it was really good, no milk, no sugar, just tea.  It had all the qualities of a perfect tea, just strong enough, taste was of that magical flavor that has tea the choice of billions of people around the world.  This was one of the best teas I had ever tasted."
My buddy bear is in love with these little snacks.  He gets all excited every time he sees me going for the bag!!  He loves em!
I have purchased this brand of tea before and knew the quality was great but glad to have gotten a great price also!!  Delivery was prompt and service was great!
"I am trying this tea for the first time. I tried the original Chai Indian spice tea yesterday and fell in love with Chai tea! I cannot taste any difference between this tea and the original Indian Spice tea. I just had a cup of each back-to-back to be sure and they taste exactly the same! I know the original has vanilla in it but no honey. I do not add any sugar or anything else to my tea and I cannot taste the honey. This tea is excellent for sure and you cannot go wrong with any of the Celestial Seasonings Chai teas, but if you are looking for a different flavor then the original try the Chocolate Enhanced tea- very good and so sweet and slightly milder then this one in terms of Indian spices and black pepper flavors. Still a wonderful tea with the health benefits of White tea and Black tea!"
"Nice flavour, almost that of malted milk balls with far less guilt.  I'm a kashi bar fan and this one is also very nice."
"Tried these Oat Bran Flakes as a replacement for the great tasting Post Fortified Oak Flakes, but they don't match up."
Our elderly female cat loves this one.  She asks for it at 6 p.m. They are strong smelling treats (the chicken flavor) and she loves them.  She seems to limping a little less.  Hope the little girl is feeling a little less achy from it.
"My cat loves this.  The pellets are nice and small and colorful.  The ingredients list is great.  Most importantly, my cat hasn't vomited on this and this is the second bag!"
This is a great change-of-pace coffee... and I almost didn't buy it because I haven't been impressed by the celebrity-named coffees (one in particular comes to mind). Glad I did. Very unique taste to it.
"This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you."
"I love Stella & Chewy's food  Sam I am  my furry friend does too, but he said that he prefers the duck dinner some times he leaves the lamb in his dish. So we will stick to the duck in the future."
Use this powdered peanut butter in smoothies.  Easy way to use for this purpose.  No messy clean up.  Saw the Hungry Girl use it and decided to give it a try.
"This flour is suitable for making ""soba"" noodle.<br /><br />I can buy whole flour of backwheat, which seems much strong soba flavour, at the local store.  However, this contains too much fiber and its noodle is nothing eatable.  On the other hand, this flour is made from buckwheat without pericycle and the noodle is ""soba"".<br /><br />On each weekend, I enjoy home made ""soba"" here Nebraska."
Our 16 year old son loves these Mike and Ikes. They are a regular order given their popularity.  We buy them weekly.
"I recently purchased a box of this candy at See's and all three of us noticed the dark chocolate was very good, but it lacked the molasses flavor. I was able to return it to the Northridge store for a refund, but found after the fact, that the box of half dark chocolate caramels and butterscotch squares had a sugary inner part as well. I and the other people believe See's is cutting corners in what they make."
"This tea seemed like a good deal, it turned out not! The tea leaves were a combination of brown, black, and crispy. There was absolutely no green to it at all. I would never buy Davidson's again."
My dogs are nuts for the Dogswell Happy Hips dried chicekn breasts but they are made in China so I hardly ever give them to my dogs.I wish the company would have them manufactured elsewhere.
"I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic.<br /><br />I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.<br /><br />Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.<br /><br />Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.<br /><br />Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Mir"
These are to die for. They are loaded with butter flavor and excellent not some skimpy small sized cookie either. A cookie that's proudly put out onto trays for company. The flavor is excellent. The price is great too. especially since it is a 2 pack. They are fantastic. you will love these I do and so does my wife.
"I have been using these beans for about 6 months with my superautomatic Capresso machine.  I primarily drink cappuccinos and lattes.  The taste is great, and reminds me of the coffee in Italy.  Another nice aspect of these beans is that they are not oily, which is especially important if using a superautomatic machine.  I ""subscribe"" to the product, which comes in a one kg bag.  The price, including shipping, comes to less than $7.40 a pound, which is an incredible bargain."
"all natural,dogs favorite treat. Don't give too many because it will constipate dog. My dogs will do anything for these treats!"
My cat neo is a four year old Tom cat. He is very particular about his food. He comes running when he hears the can opener  and he knows he's getting his fancy feast.
"This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can."
I shouldn't have bought this. I cant stop eating them. It came in the box you find in gas stations and stores and was wrapped in plastic. Arrived ahead of schedule. 5 thumbs up and amazon is bad ass!!!
"This juice is refreshing and makes me feel good knowing it has all the healthy ingredients :)<br />The ginger gives the cherries a bit of a tart taste, but it's sooo amazing"
Wonderful cheese flavor that made me order it through the Subscribe and Save program through Amazon.  I no longer have to buy it at my local Jewel and having it delivered right to my door is an added bonus.
"*****<br />Numi Tea's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a fine premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea, fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea, anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea. A powerful black tea blend indeed! There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""Numi perfects the classic breakfast tea with this organic black tea blend, Morning Rise. Four of the most extraordinary black teas compose this hearty, complex, and exciting morning cup. Ceylon, gardened in the small and exotic country of Sri Lanka, bestows its strong yet smooth profile, while Indian grown Assam imparts a malty and robust depth. Keemun, from China, offers deep burgundy notes that complement the natural floral finish and fruity Muscatel of Darjeeling, cultivated on the mountain peaks of India. This rich, bold black tea blend has an unrivaled smoothness and a magnificent aroma resembling dawn's early warmth. Let the morning greet you through the radiant daybreak of Numi's superior Breakfast Blend.""<br /><br />It tastes strong and and is perfect for people who want a black tea that is not flowery or herbal-y but tasty, complex, and superb high-quality in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
"This is a wonderful tea, I will definitely purchase it again.<br /><br />It has a good hint of Vanilla but not to sweet or overwhelming. I use this tea with my Cherry Blossom Tea Forte mug and a bit of honey and it just feels like a treat ."
"I don't know about the others, but I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer who said the Ginger Cookies were AWFUL!  Mine went into the trash after I tasted one of them. Save your money!"
"These Payday Peanut Caramel candy bars were very yummy. I don't know why the first description of the product says 8 bars. A bit further down in the details it does tell you 18 bars. $17.51 for 8 candy bars would be a rip off. But you get 18 King Size candy bars, which equals 36 regular size. So the price, with the free s/h is a good deal. I would buy again."
"Excellent flavor. Easy to make. Everybody likes it. Great product. Love chicken and sausage added, and some fresh celery. Cheap price for great value."
"My wife loves this product because my four-year-old daughter loves to have ""parties"". We found this makes makes wonderful easy and natural cupcakes."
"My doggies love these rawhide chews. (I was worried that they might not like them.) I want to be very careful about buying treats just from the USA, since so many pets are sick and/or dying from those made in some other countries. They're a little pricey, but in my mind they are worth it."
"A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it."
"Despite what the picture shows, you do not get ground mustard powder, it is the seeds. Each pound comes in a foil bag that should last for years if stored in a cool place.<br /><br />I only opened one bag, but I didn't see any ""extras"" in the bag - just mustard seed. This is so much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. I was paying  $2.50 for 1.5 oz there. Here it's not even $4/lb."
I like these. They are not gas-producing and they hold shape OK for canned beans. Flavor is good. Love that they don't have added salt.
"I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh."
"I'm a big fan of this oatmeal, but for some reason, the product I received from Amazon is off.  The consistency is just kind of off, and not the same as what I get when I get it from the grocery store.  Too bad, because the price is right."
Would not order this again.  Buying at a local store would have been better.  Seemed dry and not as fresh as I hoped.
"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the artificial sweetener taste is kind of off putting. It would be nice to find a K cup that is plain old hot cocoa powder, without all the other STUFF in it."
"I'm probably being TOO picky, cause the truth is, I've never gotten a burst of true, full blueberry flavor in any preserve/jam of that fruit I've tried. I don't know if the heating lessens the flavor or what.<br /><br />So, while this wasn't as ""true fruity"" flavored as the apricot, it was very pleasant and I enjoyed it. It has the same semi-puree consistency as the other Nature's Hollow preserve I've tried. For sugar-free, this is really nice. Only 2 grams of effective carbs per tablespoon, with 20 calories per tbsp. Ingredients: blueberries, xylitol, spring water, fruit pectin, citric acid. I like that simple list of ingredients. :)<br /><br />I am eager to try the strawberry one, now. :D"
"I love these candies and so does everyone I've ever given one too!  They make a great gift and come in this festive little box with individually wrapped Raffaellos, every one a work of art to die for!  So what's not to like???  Well, how about the fact that you can get this same product at Walmart for about $3-4.00?  Knowing that, do you really want to spend $10.00 plus shipping for a few pieces of candy???"
"I wasn't expecting this one to be so rich or full!  Yet it has a smoky finish that is typical of a French roast but doesn't taste burnt.  I think alot of times a French roast tastes thin and yet bitter instead of full and smoky, but not this one! Very pleased with it and will definitely order again.  If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try."
"This is a great assortment to give as a gift or have in an office because it has a variety of Bigelow flavors, including classics like Earl Gray and Constant Comment and the milder Green and Lemon Lift teas.  It's great that all of these teas are decaffeinated!"
"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
My daughter loves this food! I tried it and its good!Added bonus is the DHA.
This product if the best stuff if your needing to get your body back on track. It is all natural and provides a lot of magnesium for a healthy body. Will be buying again.
"This container had so many almonds in the mixture! A few almonds would've been ideal but the whole container was almonds 75% almonds! I counted the macadamia nuts in each can and there were about 4-5, and about 10 cashews, and the rest were those horrible almonds! I would've preferred peanuts! If you love almonds this is the best option for you! But if you're looking for macadamia and cashews you will be deeply depressed! I will not buy again! I cancelled my subscription because I can't keep eating cans full of almonds!"
"I am normally not a great fan of such bars, because despite all the healthy ingredients they contain hydrogentated corn syrup.  Horray,this product contains no such awful ingredient.  And they are very delicious. Crunchy oat with a lovely honey taste - not overtly sweet - just right.  there are two servings per packet totalling 180 calories.  This is a great little snack and quite filling.  Although it is very moorish- so you have better have great self-control!<br /><br />PS: we now order it on a regular basis, which does make it cheaper by at least $1 savings per box."
"My son exclaimed-""It is just like the other kids have, its great.""  I liked them too!"
This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
"There are a million different snack bars out there. The ones from Divinely D'lish are unique and in a class by themselves. I discovered them at the farmer's market in the Ferry Building in San Francisco. One taste and I was hooked for life.<br /><br />Since then, they have found their way into local shops here on the peninsula in the Bay Area. But now that they are available online at Amazon, anyone anywhere can enjoy them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is simple, straightforward, healthy and impressive. No GMO, no trans fats, unsulphered dried fruit, an emphasis on organic. They look like someone took tons of different kinds of grains (but they're wheat-free), seeds and nuts and mashed them together with dates, raisins, syrup, coconut. You can see every seed - nothing is pulverized and there's no flour filler. They're soft, but the nuts and seeds give them an oh-so-satisfying crunch.<br /><br />I heat them up very slightly and they taste like the most heavenly fresh baked cookies imaginable. My husband's favorite is the Cheeky Cherry Chocolate but since I try and steer clear of chocolate, my favorite is the Haute Diggity Date. He packs them on long business trips to help him over jet lag. I pack them as gifts for my east coast friends instead of the See's candy I used to bring. People seem to really appreciate something good to eat they don't have to feel guilty about.<br /><br />The only negative - and it's a big one - is it's almost impossible to exercise moderation with these things. Even if you can buy them locally here in the Bay Area, you might as well buy them online by the box. They'll be gone in a flash."
In the past I had purchased Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn Popping Oil. That brand was VERY good.  This one was a bit of a disappointment. I mistakenly thought it would taste pretty much the same as the Wabash oil. The flavor wasn't quite right. I will not buy this brand again.
"I'm a big fan of Raisin Bran. I like the serious, healthy flavor of bran, I really like raisins, so it's all good until about halfway through the bowl. At that point, it stops being a healthy breakfast option and turns into a bowl of soggy mush with hard raisins in it, and I have to stop eating.<br /><br />This new incarnation, Cinnamon Almond Raisin Bran, is crunchy and surprising, with the almond rescuing it from the earnestness of traditional Raisin Bran. But the real delight is whatever they've done to make the flakes stay crispy through the entire bowl. It's fantastic with whole milk and a little Sugar in the Raw (just a little).<br /><br />Delicious."
"I know some reviews said that the packaging wasn't adequate, however I think they have changed the packaging. The tea comes in a sealed foil bag, in a paper bag in the box shown. There was no spillage of the tea. The tea flavor was great in a smoothie that I made. I was very happy with the tea."
I ORDERED THIS CHEESECAKE FOR MY BROTHER FOR HIS BIRTHDAY...IT ARRIVED ON HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE REALLY ENJOYED ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS...HE SAID IT WAS A GOOD BIRTHDAY...CHEESECAKE AND PUPPIES...HIS DOG HAD PUPS...LOL...IM GONNA SEND THIS TO HIM AGAIN AND ALSO TO MY OTHER SIBLINGS AND MYSELF AS WELL...YUM...
"I lived in Europe when I was and would purchase these from street-side kiosks. These are good however I ""age"" them to greatness by leaving the cover off for about a week. This gives the belts just the right amount of staleness and brings back the nostalgia of youth."
"This is the second time that I have purchased these rawhide rolls. My dog just loves them ... he has very healthy teeth and his breath smells good! I will continue to buy them, no doubt."
This coffee is the best K cup we have tried.  It is big and bold and we love it.  STill looking for variety in the bold area but this will be hard to beat.
"My dog really loves these bull sticks!  The smell is not so bad when opening for the first time, and definitely goes away completely after a few days.<br />I recommend this product to other potential buyers."
I have been taking Tart Is Smart Cherry Concentrate (auto shipment)for about 6 months. I love the taste and the results...but just cancelled my order. The price increase is too much and I will be finding a substitute. My friends that I have turned on to this cherry juice are cancelling as well.
"Love the product.  Bought about 2 weeks ago, but the cost has gone up $12.00 very quickly.  Am buying from another source."
The ginger taste in these cookies is just about right but I would have preferred a cookie a bit less hard/crispy. These are a bit too difficult to eat in that respect for my liking although I guess that's why the call 'em 'snaps'.
I can make Starbucks at home!!!  I love this sauce!  So cheep and so worth every penny!  Make sure you get the pump to go with it though it is very thick and will drizzle and drip!  It also lasts for months!
the cocoa was the best I ever had I am dibetic and it is hard to find good tasting stuff but this taste just like it has sugar but has splenda
"Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable."
"I give this coffee five stars, but I like a really bold bitterness to my coffee.  This coffee is super flavorful, but if you like your coffee medium roast then you should go with another flavor.  This coffee will wake you up, if that's what you are looking for."
"I was so distressed that I could no longer find this product in the grocery stores!  Finding it on Amazon was such a relief, that I bought 2 cases.  This custard is such a comfort food for me, makes wonderful custard or custard pie.<br /><br />I would love to get the recipe mentioned by an earlier reviewer for cinnamon rolls using this custard."
"I was so excited to find these in our local Whole Foods.  I loved the fact that they came in individually wrapped packages (great  for travel, lunch boxes, etc).  Unfortunately, the taste was quite disappointing.  The cinnamon flavored ones were even worse.  Neither myself, nor my youngest liked either of them.  Granted, we are both somewhat picky when it comes to store-bought cookies.  I'd have loved to have given them to my oldest son (who has a real sweet tooth and likes most GFCFSF cookies I buy), but they have both soy and corn in them and he is allergic to soy and corn in addition to gluten and dairy.  Fortunately, I hadn't bought them in bulk on Amazon ...  I was surprised to see that they got such good reviews."
"I was not really sure these pretzles would be as good as claimed.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong, as good as ""regular"" pretzles if not better and healther!<br /><br />DO NOT HESITATE to try these, you will not be sorry."
"Came back from a recent trip to France where these were a staple, and back here in the good old USA nowhere to be found!  Glad for Amazon.com and being able to find these delicious sugar cubes.  They're a wonderful addition to a cup of tea in the morning."
"I like celery seeds in my salads and cooking. This is a very good product, tastes fresh, and has a good flavor."
I decided to try and get my cats to eat this because of the horrors of factory farming. I was a bit nervous though about going 100% for my male cats and frankly I don't think they would go for it. I use it to supplement their food. Half (to 2/3) of this mixed in with half Pet Promise. Pet Promise uses NO factory farmed animals. They are now getting the ultimate healthy and animal friendly option I can give them. I just wish my local pet health food stores would carry this.
Green Mountain Columbian K-Cup coffee tastes wonderfully smooth. Has the body of columbian coffees but not the strong after taste. It is truly a pleasure to drink and is my first choice for my K-Cup coffee maker.
"When in doubt my daughter will aways eat sweet potatoes.  These are good.  Sweet potatoes and water.  However, they are a little runny.  I think they thin it out more than they should.  But it is ok.  Ella's is my favorite.  They have a nice thick baby food.  Earths best is my second favorite followed by Gerber."
"I am by no means expert of soy sauce. This one seems to eb on the saltier side because I used same amount I usually use from saved pockets from Chinese take out(I know, right!) and it was a bit saltier. I'll adjust. No off flavor or anything like that."
This product is very good and tasty. It was delivered in a very timely matter.
"Today I ordered again the candies. They are great, no problem with the wraps and no broken. Great taste!!!!! They don't melt"
"I suffer from Fibromyalgia as well as other Auto-Immune Problems and decided to give this a try to see if the potassium might help with some of my muscle pain.  I have tried all of the flavors and the Vita Coco Coconut Water with Acai & Pomegranate is my favorite! (The plain is my second favorite.)  It's like a mini-treat to break up my day and I have seen a difference in the amount of pain I have been experiencing as well as it helping me with the ""dry mouth"" effects that my medication causes.<br />  I am not a medical doctor - but as someone that suffers from chronic pain - I would highly recommend at least giving this a try if you are in the same boat as I am.<br />  It takes a little while to get used to the taste - but once you do - you actually look forward to having it each day. *Hint: I have found that by putting it into the freezer for a little bit it turns into a tasty slushy that is AWESOME!"
"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period."
This is the best cappuccino coffee candy I've ever tasted. I'm so glad I finally found it online!
"I ordered this chocolate from Nutricity. Although I have no problems with the speed of the delivery, or the way the items were packaged, somewhere along the line, Nutricity did not store them well. DO NOT ORDER FROM NUTRICITY. The chocolate is dried out and discolored. It crumbles in your mouth and has a bitter, astringent taste. In comparison, I just picked up a bar at Wegmans. The color of the chocolate is darker and more consistent than the bars from Nutricity. The bar from Wegmans melts in your mouth and has complex undertones that I can't find words to describe yet. If I hadn't tried the comparison, I would have said that Green & Black's chocolate was pretty poor. However, the bar from Wegman's is a completely different chocolate. So, do not order from Nutricity, but do try Green & Blacks. I rate the chocolate from Wegmans a 5."
"I came across St. Dalfour Teas in my local supermarket this summer and made Iced Tea from their Organic Strawberry Tea. OMG, sooooo good.  No bubblegummy flavor some (supposedly) fruit based teas have.  Lately I've also had St. D's Strawberry tea hot.  Hot or cold, a great tea.<br /><br />I also love the cheery box and packets.<br /><br />Ordering through Amazon, the price was 1/2 that of  supermarkets. SO glad I stocked up via Amazon."
"My hair is dry and damaged from years of coloring and blow-drying, and this shampoo makes it feel soft and silky. And it smells so great, and leaves my hair smelling good for hours afterwards. I love it!!!"
"These treats were recommended for our 125 lb German Shepherd, Rocky, who is on a restricted diet because of all the things he is allergic to.  He loves them and I'm happy Amazon carries these flavors, can't find them in our neighborhood stores."
MY AUNT AND I USE THESE COOKIES FOR ALL KINDS OF OCCASIONS AND WE WERE THRILLED WITH THE SMALLER SIZE. THEY ARE NICE FAVORS OR JUST TO GIVE SOMEONE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT. BEST PART IS ....THEY ARE DELICIOUS!! TRY THEM. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
"This onion sauce is great, and go's great with corn silver side so get your self some Colman's Onion sauce, you will love it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051C0DN6"">Colmans Onion Sauce Sachet 35g</a>"
Delicious crunchy substantial even my puppy begged me for it whenever I nibble on it.  Best snack u could get your hands on ... I couldn't help binging.  But hey who cares.  It's organic and it's apple
"Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut bar was well-described as a ""cookie"" by a fellow reviewer.  We would only add that they resemble a healthier treat without a crunch.  Pamela's Product comes in a kid-size portion, which may not be enough for some; and they are very soft--and easily crushed if left in a pocket or bag.  See the photo we uploaded...straight from the package, one corner was bent easily, while another broke in pieces.<br /><br />However, besides being tasty, these Whenever Bars are gladly wheat-free, non-dairy, and offer nutrients that most cookies lack."
"I like Rajah hot curry - it's very good, but nothing stands out about it.  Having tried Sharwood's hot curry, in comparison it's much better.  I guess the ingredients are the key:<br /><br />Sharwood's Hot Curry Ingredients:  Coriander, Turmeric, Fenugreek, Cumin, Salt, Mustard Powder, Rice Flour, Paprika, Fennel (3%), Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Cinnamon, Chilli, Clove, Ginger, Pepper, Bay Leaf, Cardamom, Nutmeg, Spice Extract<br /><br />Rajah Hot Curry Ingredients:  Coriander, Turmeric, Chilli, Garlic, Bengal Gram, Yellow Mustard, Fenugreek, Bay Leaves, Salt, Cumin, Fennel"
"This was my first time trying House Foods brand of instant curry, and it tastes okay. My only complaint is that it's not ""Medium Hot"". Like another reviewer stated, the taste is very mild--it's not spicy at all. If I had known this, I probably would've gotten the ""Hot"" flavor or one from the S&B brand (I usually like spicier Japanese curries)."
You can't afford not to buy this. This stuff is like super awesome. Just leave it over night and BAM! Why say no when it feels soo good to say Yes.
"In the last couple of months, I have been on this adventure searching for the BEST and Natural coconut juice.  I have tasted many brands such as Vitacoco, O.N.E, and many other Asian brand.  Hands down Amy and Brian has the best taste out of all.  I was a firm believer Vitacoco was the best until I tried Amy & Brian."
"I just had a bowl of split pea soup for a part of my lunch. It was Amy's Organic Split Pea Soup and it was quite good. It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee."
"I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats . Unfortunetly , I cannot write a review because none of the cats would eat it . This is also true of the turkey and salmon flavor I purchased at the same time . Guess they just don't have a yen for a higher end cat food ! Sorry"
Love these cookies!!!  Breakfast every day at work with my tea.  I have been hooked on these for a few years now.  Stores prices gone up so I order off Amazon and save alot of $$$$$!!
"I bought the Greenpowder Green Tea and tastes great. The Jasmine also has a great taste and aroma.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon has increased its price close to 20% in a about a month. I don't imagine the tea having increased by that amount in the stores."
"I buy these lollipops for my kids, and they really like them, especially the grape and strawberry. I actually like these better than regular lollipops, since the fruit flavors are real - they don't have that ""chemical"" taste. Some of my kids are sensitive to artificial colors and flavors, so it's great to have these for holidays and occasional treats for the family.<br /><br />As others have noted, the distribution of flavors tends to be uneven, but since they are all good, this hasn't been a serious issue to us.<br /><br />The colors are bright and pretty, but they are not the neon colors you see with artificially-colored candies. The watermelon is a pretty light pink, the grape is purple, the cherry and strawberry are darker pinks, etc. If you're used to artificially-colored candies, the biggest surprise will be the sour apple, which is yellow.  Some flavors are two-toned; the mango is especially striking, part clear orange and part opaque light yellow.<br /><br />Of course, organic candy is always more expensive than the artificially-flavored stuff, but this large package is pretty cost-effective.  With the subscribe & save discount, these lollipops currently cost about a dime each, which I think is a good deal."
i missed the taste of real milk chocolate and when i tasted this man did the memory's come flooding back. This is the real thing ans it is so so good. now if i could only find some spaghetti ice
"OK, as much as I loved appletini flavor is almost exactly how much I don't love mojito.  Perhaps I just don't like mojitos.  There is just something about mint being in any drink...I just don't like it.  So, if you are a mint fan, you probably would like it.  The flavors are certainly well blended and the mint is very slight.  Glad to have tried it...won't buy it again."
"Took a chance ordering this brand when there was no indication how much neem there was per capsule in their online description.  It turns out there is only 100mg of extract + 25mg of powder, far far less than all the other brands, and its not even organic to boot.  That's what I get for making my decision based on it being eligible for free ""super saver"" shipping."
"This product re-hydrates beautifully!  I live a long way from the store and shallots add such a wonderful dimension to many food dishes, it is just plain fun to have them always available."
"This is my favorite K cup by far. Strong, bold with tons of flavor. I have been looking for several months for coffee as good as this."
...and something seems to be working! It could be this alfalfa tea which tastes just like...alfalfa tea. My aunt has pain too and does not like to be without this tea.
"I'd had no luck finding a gluten-free brown sugar substitute until I found this on Amazon - and checked the manufacturer's website, which assured me it is gluten-free.  AND mostly xylitol - the sugar substitute I prefer anyway.  So I order one bag to try it, and quickly went back to order more.<br /><br />It's great stuff - more like light brown sugar than dark brown, so I need to add a tad of molasses in some of my baking.  And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.<br /><br />But mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TXT502"">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.  Yum."
"For pastry type baking, pie crust, fluffy pancakes, brownies, etc. this is a really nice flour.  It works well with any recipe calling for baking powder and/or soda since it is very light. No need to mix whole wheat and white, just use this 100% stone ground flour. The yogurt pancakes on the bag are terrific."
tastes like dry brownie w/ invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars.
"I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."
"This cocoa powder makes a rich, yummy cocoa whether mixing into hot milk or hot rice milk.  Mix it into Greek plain yogurt and it tastes like a chocolate mousse, but healthier.  Mix it into smoothies too!"
"If your diabetic, you must try this product for baking.  As diabetics know you have to careful as to how you choose the type of carbs and how much of them you eat.  I make blueberry pie, muffins, cake, pancakes, etc.  and does not affect my sugars.  May not be the same for every diabetic but sure is worth the try!  Delicious too!"
"Cheaper than at the grocery store and convenient havint it delivered, but one has to wait for availablity."
"I love Red Tea by Stash.  It is very difficult to find in my local supermarkets.  I asked if one would special order, and they hemmed and hawed.  So a friend suggested I check Amazon.com for the tea.  And in just a short time I had a huge stock of Red Tea.  It is great that this was so convenient and easy to shop."
"Well worth the price.  Lasts a very long time and my dog loves to chew them. One piece of rawhide lasts a few minutes and is a source of fat and hard to digest.  Here he is cleaning his teeth, getting calcium and he has it for months."
"Simply Heinz Ketchup is the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS. I bought mine at costco and was pleased to see Heinz changed over to getting rid of HFCS. I can now buy ketchup again from costco.  The only thing better then this is organic .<br /><br />HFCS Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?"
"I love to snack and with these you truly feel that you must be ""cheating"" somehow!  The flavors are delicious and the variety is great so that you don't get too tired of any one flavor. Have this set up for ""routine delivery"" every 4 months, with the Popchips I get and the Tortilla Popchips I'm set for healthy snacks and they all come at different times so I never have too many at any given time."
"Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)"
"I'm a long time Splenda user, so I took this opportunity to review the Splenda with the vitamins B in it. Frankly, I can't figure out the rationale for putting vitamins in the Splenda in the first place.<br /><br />I can tell you that this tastes no different to me than Splenda without the vitamins. That's the good part. The bad part is that, I would assume to keep the product fresh with the vitamins in it, they had to put it in a foil-lined packet. I feel this is an inconvenience. The packets are harder to open, and therefore harder to pour the contents of the packet into the cup.<br /><br />I would certainly not pay anything extra for the vitamins in my Splenda. As I said, makes no sense to me. (Nor do I want them to put ""fiber"" in my Splenda, which I've seen advertised)."
"This product is great for a variety of purposes. I tried it to keep my hair from frizzing and to help with a dry scalp. It works  well for both purposes! And it smells good too.The price is great for the value. I have tried many products that I've spent at least four times as much money on which have not given me as good of a result as this one. You can make a hot oil treatment with it in winter and rub your scalp with it to nourish with moisture against the harsh sun of summer. The only reason it did not merit 5-stars is because I am such a purist when it comes to ingredients. No worries - It would have had to fall off a tree to be pure enough to make 5-stars for me.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>"
"*THIS* is the stuff right here!<br /><br />I had been going through a ton of K-CUP varieties trying to find a really good, strong coffee. I'm a bit of a coffee-snob and most of the K-CUPs I tried just left me saying ""Meh... It's 'ok'. Not terrible, not great just 'ok'.""<br /><br />Even the K-CUPs marked 'extra-bold' left me wondering who decided this coffee was even deserving of the name ""slightly bold"", let alone ""extra bold"". I usually found myself using 2 K-CUPS, and running the small cup size twice just to get 1 decent cup of coffee - and even then the flavor just wasn't quite ""there"" (to me, they always taste ""old"", as if someone ground halfway-decent beans but then left it out open and exposed to the air overnight to spoil.)<br /><br />.. and then I picked up some Black Tiger.. Yeah!!! This is the *only* K-CUP I've found so far where I can choose the 12 oz brewing size and still get decent cup of coffee that doesn't taste like someone rinsed out my cup and served me hot water instead of coffee.<br /><br />Now even as such, this coffee is *still* not nearly as good as the cup of coffee that I can get with my good old french press using coffee that was roasted 2 days ago and ground 2 minutes ago. Sorry, ain't no way a K-CUP is going to get you that level of coffee. Ever.<br /><br />However, this variety is still darn good for a K-CUP and definitely deserving of my morning cup of coffee! (coming from me, that's saying *alot*!)"
"A nice tasting miso.  It is salty, but you don't need to use a lot to make a good soup broth.  Add it at the end of cooking so it doesn't get over heated."
Writing this on behalf of my husband who uses the Keurig machine.  He loves the Black Tiger!  It's one of the few K-cup coffees he feels is strong enough.  Make it on the small size brew and it's dynamic.
"Well, this is definitely an energy drink that served my purpose well. I just needed something to give me some energy to go work out, because at the time, I was very tired. When I drunk this, it gave me the energy to get up and go work out. The flavor wasn't too bad. It tasted like a typical energy drink."
"This is the only pizza crust my son will eat. My non-allergy child who has had wheat pizza and this, loves it. Very easy to use. I usually pre-bake all 3 and slice, then freeze them. That way I can pull a couple pieces out, defrost and pizza is served on a whim."
This product advertises that it breaks apart easily for training. Maybe if you have a chain saw handy! The product is as hard as a rock and nearly impossible to break into small pieces to reward poochy.
"I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning."
"One of my cats goes wild over these beef treats. The other two cats like them to, but have to be fast to keep them away from her."
"I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!"
"I have been using this protein powder in my breakfast smoothies for two years.  I really like that this product doesn't have a soy or whey protein.  I try to avoid too much soy because if we read labels we find that a lot of foods have soy in them and I feel like we get too much inadvertantly. Hemp Protein, with the omega's is a very good alternative.  Just read the label to find all the good in it!"
"An unusual blend of 7 grain flour.  Never thought of a couple of it's grain in 7-grain flour but this makes incredible homemade bread.  We have bought 7 grain bread from Montana, but this miller has out done the Westerners.  One of my wife's secrets in her bread making is using the correct baking pans.  She use the commercial Analon pans that bake to perfection.  They were an initial investment, but last a lifetime."
I still haven't figured out what I'm going to do with the 3-pack that I bought from amazon. I tasted one bar and completed it with great difficulty. I am a regular breakfast bar eater and bought this expecting meal bars to keep hunger away fro longer than breakfast bars do. I love strawberries too yet I say these taste terrible!
"These cookies are soft, but not really chewy. They are more crumbly than chewy. They are chocolate chip cookies with a core of soft chocolate. Tasty, but very sweet and a little salty. Definitely for a chocolate lover. The chocolate may be little overpowering. They leave you thirsty, so you'll want something to drink available. They go great with milk. The cookies are smaller than your average Chips Ahoy! The cookies got a little beat up in the mail, but for the most part they held up well. Not my favorite, but still very enjoyable."
My dogs are nuts for the Dogswell Happy Hips dried chicekn breasts but they are made in China so I hardly ever give them to my dogs.I wish the company would have them manufactured elsewhere.
"The product arrived outdated by a month or so.  Since it was salad dressing, we had to throw it out.  Purchase price was refunded without any question."
"We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog."
good amount of fiber for only a few calories!  Put peanut butter or cheese on them.  Make sure to drink a large glass of water with it to work with the fiber.
i ordered the red velvet pancake mix for valentines day and it was the best!  Now i know where i can order this mix from it will be on my shopping list!
"These candies are very good - super sour for the first 10 to 15 seconds and then a nice lemon flavored hard candy after that.  My problem is the price - $7.99 for a 2.6 ounce bag.  Too much, in my opinion."
I love that I can pack these for my sons to take to school without worrying about refridgeration.  My son is  lactose intolerant and he LOVES this brand.<br /><br />The attached straw can be somewhat tricky for little ones to use but it's a very ingenious design.
"My two tiny toy poodles love Stella and Chewy's chicken patties! I soak them in hot water for a few minutes before feeding it to them and they not only eat the patties but lap up all the juice too. They love fresh raw meat but are pretty picky about eating anything dried or crunchy, so this is a great compromise. I don't have to worry about refrigeration or using it all up before it goes bad and they love it as much as fresh. The only thing I don't like is the price."
"Besides being just plain tasty, a small addition of Nutiva coconut oil to my daily diet lowered my triglycerides and ""bad"" cholesterol. It also ended nightly coughing from what my doctor diagnosed as gastric reflux. Better coconut oil than prescription proton inhibitors that leach calcium from your bones!"
"The size of the beans I received do not appear to be (extra large). They appear to be of the normal size available locally. They look clean and arrived quickly. I'll use them but, not what I expected."
These are absolutely mouth watering! If you like pecan pie you will love these. This is the best part of the pie!
"I was looking for something more ""Grown Up"" in a frosted mini wheat and these actually tasted better than Kellogs. Still looking for the ultimate healthy cereal though."
"Wow. This is the best waffle mix I've ever had. I haven't tried to make pancakes with it because I just bought a new waffle maker & I make waffles every weekend for me and my boyfriend. So yeah, this mix is the absolute best!!! I cut the mixture in half (using a kitchen scale) and adjust the amounts of milk, oil and eggs accordingly. I couldn't think of a better breakfast to have on the weekend!!"
I only buy xylitol sweetend candy and gum for dental health. We love these little fruit flavored candies and my grandkids think they are a real treat!
"Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Very smooth taste. Medium dark color. Great tea and brand. Economical. Assam can be a wonderful place to visit when calm. Off the well-beaten and ordinary tourist path. Beautiful people. Possible to take the train (or a flight) from Kolkata [Calcutta.] Large parts of Assam are blanketed with beautiful tea gardens. Stayed at a tea garden in Assam on one of my visits there. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. Also really like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E268"">Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.

Once you pop one in your mouth...you can tell these ain't Doritos and that it is a quality product...now the secret is to buy em on sale...
"The quality of the nuts is ok, but no where as good or as cheap as Costco use to sell.<br /><br />We added the sea salts ourselves, somehow they don't seems to taste as good."
"Like many others, I needed the pumpkin for my dogs and I needed it quickly.  I didn't have a problem with any dented cans so that problem seems to have been corrected.  My dogs absolutely loved this pumpkin! Even my pickiest dog was wanting more and that doesn't usually happen. I will continue to buy this brand even after the Libby's shortage is over."
"My daughter didn't care for these at all, but my husband did and he's a die-hard fast food junkie. I would buy again."
"Coffee is good for decaf. But every so often the pod puts grounds in my cup, to the point where I have to pour it out. Not all pods do this."
Got this for a gift.  Pricey because of the fact that it is a real import from Germany.  Product reportedly arrived promptly and well packed.  Taste was fresh and as expected.  Would prefer the single packs if they were available.
"My first reaction to these when I opened the pack was ""Wow, they smell good enough to eat!""  I'm not sure that matters, since some of my dogs' favorite treats smell like something I don't even want to touch (check out their most favorite sometime, Icelandic fish skins -- ick! I have to face the bag away from me when I open it.)  Nevertheless, it moved the Newman's Own treats up a notch in my own preferences.<br /><br />Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to confess that I have Cardigan Welsh Corgis, a breed infamous for its hearty and undiscriminating appetite.  Having said that, they loved these treats.  They found it hard to sit still to get one (standard house rules) because they had to wiggle and wag and be all-over excited about them.<br /><br />Each bag contains only 10 ounces of treats, which does make them expensive, but good ingredients never come cheap (if price is your only deciding factor, brace yourself before you go look at those fish skins).  Given the healthy ingredients and my dogs' reaction to them, I would certainly buy them again."
"The product is great and the baby loves it.  Too bad it's not available locally to where I live because Amazon uses UPS as a delivery service.  They are the slowest, most ridiculous service imagineable. I could walk to the location and get it quicker.  Now we have to wait around on the weekend to get a delivery when the product was purchased a week ago and the post office would have had it to us in two days.  ""What can brown do for me?"" They can go out of business and leave the delivery to people who know how to do it promptly."
"This is a great product.  So easy to use,  makes consistent coffee every time"
Very good taste.  Having them in individual packages is wasteful but it makes it so much easier when you are out and about with the kids.
I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.  I now purchase a case at a time.  The clove and licorice flavors are wonderful and very soothing.  Very nice to have at Christmas time!
"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me."
"I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds, these are The BEST.<br /><br />The taste great, are REALLY crunchy - a key requirement for me - and have just the right amount of salt. The Newman's Rounds are just as good - maybe even better.<br /><br />And as an added bonus, Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity - an unbeatable combination in my book!"
I just paid less than half that for the exact same product at a local competitor. And they want more words!!!
"I've been on the Dukan diet (Stabilization phase now) for several months - this is my go-to oat bran that the diet requires daily. I mix it with hot skim milk, sweetener, and cinnamon for a nice hot cereal/diet dessert. Bob's Red Mill has consistently delivered superior products for my household."
"I'm a big fan of Wheat Thins. I'm also a big fan of buffalo wings. So when I saw these for sale at a local store earlier today, I bought a box.<br /><br />I won't buying another. There isn't anything notably wrong with this combination, but it's a mis-match in flavor types: wheat thins are a mix of sweet and salty, and are much sweeter than most crackers. Buffalo sauce (and I have to admit, the buffalo powder recipe on these crackers is pretty good) is spicy, with a slight sour flavor from the vinegar. When you eat one of these, you get the buffalo flavor, and then you get the normal, sweet flavor of a Wheat Thin. It's a peculiar sensation, sort of like you were eating Wheat Thins and then accidentally stuck one in the buffalo dip. You like the buffalo, you like the Wheat Thin, but when you grab another cracker you don't dip it in the sauce again because the cracker is better without it.<br /><br />If you want a good flavored Wheat Thin, try the cinnamon Wheat Thins that are sold around the Christmas holiday. They're wonderful. Or, if you don't want sweet, a small slice of extra sharp cheddar makes a great topping."
"A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon."
I lived in Hawaii a while back and fell in love with these candies.  They're amazing!  Try them.
I ordered this item on November 14 and I'm still waiting on it.  Wasn't informed that there would be a delay when I ordered.  I'm getting pretty impatient.
I sprayed it on her scratching post and she immediately started to rub her face in it. I also did not notice any unattractive odors.
"After searching local stores for almost a year and not finding this anywhere, I'm glad they have it here, just hope they continue to carry it in the future."
"It's delicious and very tasty just like the ones I've had at Thai restaurants. It does say in the pkg that its green tea but hey GREEN is better and healthier than black tea and I'm happy about that because I never knew what it was made of, I just knew I loved it and ordered it all the time from Thai restaurants. I add white table sugar, half & half and ice and it is Ahh-MAZING. I brew 1 cup in 2 liters of water, at the end the leaves are pitch black like coffee but the tea is that beautiful burnt-orange color. I tried to go healthy and used agave once, honey once, and skimmed milk. It was gross that way and I had to throw it out."
"I went to Hawaii last Fall to see a friend who introduced me to fresh, young, coconut water. Once I returned to the mainland I craved the flavor of coconut water. It is yummy and so refreshing. So I found some at the local grocery store, but it wasn't very good. Then I found this brand on sale at the store and tried it and fell in love. It is SO close to the same refreshing coconut juice I had in HI and I love it so much I have it ordered via the Amazon subscription service so that I can save a little $$$ too. Definitely recommend."
Have used this product for many years very pleased with it and will continue to purchase it in the future.thank you!!
I think this is one of the best brands of the best juice you can buy. I have had a couple of lids come off but have not expierenced any leaking. Please bring them back.
"I've searched in every grocery store for this tea and no one stocks it any more, I was so happy to find it on Amazon and the fact it was cheaper than when I could find it in the stores, thanks for stocking it."
"I just love this tea. I drink it every morning because it has such a smooth flavor. I also like the fact that I'm getting both black and green teas combined as they both have great health benefits. If you like green tea, you'll like this one. Smooth, not bitter and it tastes great with stevia rather than sugar!<br /><br />I switched to buying it from Amazon because my local stores quit carrying it. When I saw the price at Amazon, I realized I was saving over $1 a box from the store price! WOW! I should have bought it here a long time ago."
"I was looking for a new snack item. Someone told me to look for flavored popcorns. Not sure what to expect when I purchased this.<br />Well...Pleasantly surprised. The taste is a cross between Cheetos  and Cheesits. Popcorn pops very well with only 10-12 un-popped kernels.  BE PREPARED! Messy popcorn but Oh So Good!  The coloring is as expected orange. You can confirm this by touching anything after you have a handful. Paper towels are a must. Addictive, Messy, Easy to Prepare, what more can you expect of a snack."
Great for a change in tortilla chips. Tasty and not bland like some blue chips. Not too salty. A bit healthier than most similar snacks.
This is the Light version of Wafu Original (toasted sesame).  It's equally as delicious as the original even though it has 43% less fat.  A fantastic alternative if you're counting calories.
"We've had our Kuering machine for over a year now.  We love it.  However, we've had a problem finding BOLD coffee.  Emeril's is very tasty and bold.  While it's not our favorite, it is up there at the top.  Sign up for Amazon's club and save money and postage.  You'll enjoy a very good cup of coffee at a very reasonable price."
"I was pleasantly surprised how lightweight this oil is and how quickly it absorbs in to my skin.  I also cook with it a little and it isn't too strong, although I keep thinking I smell like a large macaroon after I rub this in to my hands and arms. (It fades in a few minutes)  I've started giving it to my very old and very finicky cat, who to my surprise and delight, enjoys licking it off my fingers after she eats her dinner.  Her digestion has improved and it helps her keep a little weight on.  I would definitely buy this again!"
"I thought it would be wonderful if amazon.com provide some ingredients info..so I googled it and here it is.<br /><br />The KONG Stuff'N Puppy Ziggies unique chewy formula creates a safe and reliable, healthy digestible treat that will not crack or splinter.

"This is a good tasty juice. It contains acai berries that are known for the antioxidant abilities. I drink it every morning, it nicely stabilize my metabolism. I like this flavor the most, it's less sour than the original flavor."
"Sorry, but something has changed. I am a major fan of Good Earth Tea, but they have changed something in their recipe. I bought one of the new purple boxes of the ""Original Sweet and Spicy"", and it is neither. Just dark colored water. Think twice before buying this!"
"I wanted to give my mom a cake for her birthday, but I live 400 miles away from her.  I saw this cake and was a little nervous to purchase a cake online, not knowing if it would still be fresh by the time it reached her.<br /> Although they do not mention it, the cake was delivered frozen and packed in dry ice, inside a styrofoam container. It took a day in the refridgerator for the cake to thaw,but afterwards my mom said the cake was so moist and fresh that it tasted like it was just baked.  Also she said that it was so full of coconut that after the cake was gone there was still tons of coconut leftover.  So for me that was worth the price."
"I bought my product, which was 6 jars of soy butter in May.  When it arrived I discovered that it expired in January, giving me 7-8 months to eat 6 jars of it.  I loved the flavor of the product, it is quite better than any of the peanut butter alternatives that we can purchase at the grocery store. Next time I need this product I think I will find another mom with a peanut allergic kid and split the case so I don't have to eat so much in such a short time.<br /><br />I'd give the flavor 5 stars."
It is by far the easiest way to measure the right amount. I love the different flavors that are available.
Try this in jambalaya instead of regular rice -- Dynamite.  Gives a whole new meaning to cajun cooking.
"This soup is super easy to heat and tastes yummy!  I usually don't like add water and mix soups, but this actually tastes good.  I add corn chips, sour cream, and cheese when I'm at home, but the soup tastes good when I'm at school and eat it plain.  Plus, it's got a lot of fiber!  Twenty-four percent of my daily value in the whole cup!"
"I will admit, my dog is spoiled. Not in a ""dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled."" Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat ""caps."" The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official ""Everlasting"" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it ""just right."" He eats like a cat (when he's hungry), but likes all kinds of food.<br /><br />Crockett and I both hope that this helps you choose well for your pet!"
The tea comes in sealed individual packages of 4 bags each.  The envelopes are easily sealed on removal of individual tea bags.  The tea is excellent.  The price at Amazon can't be beaten.
"If your on a diet eat this pasta it won't spike your insulin intake to high.<br /><br />Taste Great, east this to stay healthy.<br /><br />-T-"
"The Zuke's Mini Naturals is great for training and while on walks, however, this treat will dry out fast and become very hard. My mini schnauzer will refuse the treat when it is no longer moist. The treat is ok as long as the bag is kept sealed tightly. Zuke's Mini Naturals is healthy and made in USA."
"If you love bottled water, and are looking for one that is the purest and cleanest tasting then look no further. Essentia drinking water is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis which leaves it as one of the best PH balanced waters available 9.5. There are no No chlorine or fluoride and the water is only enhanced with pure minerals. This water is so clean you can taste it and I absolutely love it."
"When you just have to have a dark chocolate, this is what you want.  Four squares served with a glass of fruity red wine, and you'll feel like Maxine has come to visit!  But, remember it's a ""dry"" chocolate with LOTS of cocoa, and not creamy."
"I made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce.  It was great.  I love the fact that it doesn't have MSG in it.  It has the right amount of sweetness.  It is a little spicy, but just the right amount."
"Great product, I never cook this in the microwave because sometimes it takes longer and not all microwaves are the same.  I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they ""poof"" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook."
excellent taste.  very impressed.  I am disappointed though that the price has gone up significantly since I bought it back in December.  Beautiful beans - great aroma and flavor.
This was a great deal when Amazon offered the 4 pack.  One Bag goes down pretty quick.  The Oberto Brand is good as always and It makes for a great snack food when working in the office or at the comupter.  Hopefully Amazon will have these on sale again as I would order another 4 pack.
"As a serious coffee drinker, I should have read the other reviews. My coffee preferences are Bold and Dark blends. I like a strong cup of coffee and this was very watery to me. I brewed it on the smallest cup size and still thought it was weak.<br />it smells amazing. But if you like a good strong cup of coffee do not buy this. My roommate who prefers lighter coffee, really liked this one. She can keep the extras, im going for that dark Roast cup of coffee.<br />And if you arent sure if you are a DARK or a LIGHT roast person, if you prefer your morning cuppa at Starbucks- then you prefer a dark roast. If you prefer a cup from Dunkin or krispy, you like the lighter roasts- so this cinnamon roll would satisfy you."
"I was chagrined by the contents; way too salty, so that the nuts had little flavor left. Also, the peanuts were about 80%, and low grade examples at that. Not a gourmet item, might be all right for commercial use."
"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better!"
"Sun Maid pitted plums (or, prunes) are the best brand of pitted and dried plums on your grocer's shelf--period. These dried pitted plums are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They contain sugar (12 grams per serving) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />In addition, a few of these helps fight constipation really well! Don't eat too many--you'll have stomach trouble--trust me!<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these pitted plums are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that they do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily. In my personal opinion, I love to refrigerate these and eat them cold. They are remarkably sweet, too.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the container. Eat or use these before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These pitted plums are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Pitted Plums provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!"
"The quality of this product is fine, but I wish I'd sprung for a couple more bucks and gotten the Spanish paprika. I think it would have had more flavor."
These spices are the freshest spices ever....they have no msg and are a GREAT value. You get miniscule jars at the supermarket with ingredients you can't pronounce. I am a life time customer of Marshalls Creek Spices!
"I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or ""silky"" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat."
My dog loves Cesar dog food and Chicken & Beef is high on her favorite list. Good value.<br />Recieved with in the time given.
Anyone who love chai lattes but not the huge calorie in take from coffee shop versions will love this.  It tastes just as wonderful and is a soothing treat on cold nights.  Highly recommended!
I can not drink caffeinated coffee late in the afternoon.  Tully's decaf coffee allows me to enjoy my coffee before bedtime!  It doesn't affect my sleep.  Ordering some more now!
"I love the mango, whole nuts and coconut in these bars! They are perfect for a mid-day snack. My 10 year old granddaughter is always asking if she can take one for snack break at school."
"I love this tea.  Tried it initially at a friend's home and instantly loved it.  This tea is delicious.  It's not a boring raspberry tea.  the flavor is much more complex.  Even with me trying to conserve it, I've been averaging 2oz a week.  My friends and I jokingly refer to it as Raspberry Crack Tea.  I especially love that this tea tastes great both Hot and Iced.  Some teas just don't taste right both ways."
I love PB2! It tastes just like peanut butter with out the fat and calories and works great with my visalus shakes!
I purchased this for my Hubby. It's another great tea by Celestial Seasonings. He also loves a good cup of tea.<br /><br />Thanks Celestial Seasonings and Amazon
"My daughter was exclusively breastfed until she was 6 months. We tried weaning her earlier, but she refused other formulas we tried. She would hold out refusing to eat until she got breast milk. When we tried Earths Best, she took to it right away. She hasn't had any digestion problems with this formula. It is expensive compared to generic, but worth it!"
"My son can consume the whole box in two days! Great price for a quick snack...maybe it's not the healthy food I would like to see him eat, but it makes him happy! And I don't really let him eat the whole box in 2 days!"
"My dogs all love the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Chews, they can't wait to get them and know where I keep them, they go straight to the cupboard where they are stored. I love giving them these treats because not only do they love the taste and gobble them up, I feel good knowing they contain healthy ingredients that will give them stronger bones.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>"
"I've always been a huge fan of 5-hour energy drinks, but it's just too expensive for me to take on a regular basis, I know I tried! I've always preferred not to drink coffee, the only way I can stand it is if I overload it with sugar so that's kind of a bust. My co-worker who is a crazy health nut introduced me to this energy stack, Energy Booster Stack (90 Day Servings!) Better Than Jack3d, Red Bull, Monster, Hemorage, Caffeine, Rockstar Drink which I've been taking in the morning and really liking it. If you ever taken raspberry ketones, dmaa, or yohimbine extract then you know what I mean when I talk about an energy high that feels different from caffeine.<br /><br />I also like the cost, very affordable. I'll always be a 5-hour energy drinker here and there but if you need a consistent source of energy and are concerned with price, this is the most effective and cost effective energy booster I've found. Hope this helps someone!"
This makes the best jello salad / dessert and I cannot find apricot jello in the stores in town.  Make jello as directed with 1 cup orange juice (heat to boiling).  Stir in 1 cup buttermilk and a box of apricot jello.  Store in the refrigerator.  This is divine.  The recipe easily doubles and triples.  Hope you enjoy.
I really like the taste of this cappuccino.  Some complained that it's a waste because the k-cup is empty after it is brewed.  Why is that important?  I enjoy it and so does my family and co-workers.
"Just to let you know, I would not try this stuff myself.  So I can only tell you what my nephew in Missouri told me when I sent it to him.  He said he touched a small amount to his tongue and over an hour later, his tongue was still numb!  But since he's gotten familiar with using it in the right quantity, he is joyous over it.  Obviously, he is more in love with pain than most.  He cooks quite a bit and uses an assortment of very spicy concoctions.  He said this flavor (sparingly), is quite good for a hot sauce.  So you'd better have a very LARGE pain threshold should you care to try this one."
I have three cats.  One of them will eat these but only half-heartedly and I find the remains of some left behind so they are not a big hit.
"*First I want to point out that the actual product I purchase lists whole rolled oats on the package as the first ingredient, not the second as is listed on the Amazon website.  Check out [...] to read the actual ingredients fresh from the baker.*<br /><br />I work in a facility that stocks these in their employee cafe, where I pay $2 a pop for each - it is well-worth it!  As an on-the-go mom and employee, I often don't get to eat breakfast at all, let alone sit down to enjoy it.  What I love best about these cookies is that they are made with quality ingredients, yet there are flavor options.  That seems so rare these days!<br /><br />I'm a major chocoholic, so I reach for the only chocolate flavor my work stocks: this vegan chocolate chunk.  As another reviewer pointed out - these chocolate chunks aren't plentiful, but they are big.  I like the fruity flavor, so then its a treat when I bite into a bite of chocolate.  I detect a hint of banana when I eat mine, but definitely not overpowering or even obvious unless you are trying to pinpoint the flavor.  I think they are sufficiently moist, not crumbly, and filled with flavor.<br /><br />The sticker shock of 300 calories and 54g of carbs initially took me by surprise, despite how big these are and the whole oats as the first ingredient.  The cafe employee assured me these were a ""whole meal in a cookie"" but I was still skeptical until I ate one.  The first one I had... I ate less than half around 10am, and then finished it as a dessert after lunch (1pm).  I was beyond satisfied, and FULL!  Then I started eating them for breakfast and I am just amazed.  It usually takes me about an hour or more to get through one (and I'm normally a mindless eater - just shovel in the fuel) but not with these.  They fill me up after just a few bites, so I'm able to slow down my eating.  If I eat the cookie by 9am I am full until lunchtime (or beyond).  In fact, on my long 12-hour days, I am able to push my lunch hour back by 2 hours so I can enjoy dinner with my family instead of out of a take-out container.  I just couldn't ask for a better option - to keep me full, be good-for-me, and be convenient.  In fact, I'm ordering regular ones for myself and the minis for my 4-year old.  What a FANTASTIC treat to help our mornings!!!  (And since they are cookies, she'll think they are an incentive to move along faster LOL)."
This product makes a good cup of coffee at a reasonable price for the Keurig coffee maker and I would recommend it.
I have ordered this product quite a few times. It is so delicious. I take several packs to school and share among other students when lectures tend to be boring. Everyone loves them. The price is incredible and it really is good value for your money.
"Don't let the previous negative reviews fool you. This peanut butter ROCKS! It's as peanutty as can be, making the texture slightly thicker and a bit stiff. Not a big deal, just take an extra 15 seconds to spread it. As far as fillers go, there aren't any, just (in order) roasted peanuts, ONLY 3 grams of sugar per 32 gram serving, with only 3.5 grams of saturated fat and only 6% sodium. The nutritional values are very high, including substantial levels of Niacin, Magnesium, Vitamin E, Iron and Calcium. Of course there will be a bit of naturally occurring oil, but it's minimal and does not need stirring like other Natural peanut butter. My daughters and I, sometimes eat it right off the spoon! If you enjoy baking peanut butter cookies, you'll never use any other brand of peanut butter. TRY IT!"
"This product, cereal, arrived on time and was as as good as expected.  What more can I say about cereal?"
"I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays!"
This great tasting oatmeal is highly recommended.  Its relative low sugar and delicious taste make this my favorite hot cereal.  Throw in the fact that its gluten free and this one is a winner.
"I have become quite the tea drinker, a bit of a tea snob actually.  I have tried them all. I no longer drink tea bag tea, only full leaf loose tea.  This English Breakfast tea by Stash, (full leaf loose) is by far my favorite and one I always come back to.  It has a nice body and aroma, yet never muddy.  Never bitter either.  I always add milk, never sugar, because to me, this tea has a natural sweetness to it.  It is clean & smooth, yet rich.<br />It has a perfect balance for my taste.  I cannot understand why some people only give this tea one star, maybe they just received a bad batch.  I will say that I have noticed slight differences from different batches I have received throughout the years.  I have been drinking this tea for 6 years now, and I love it."
This is a very nice product. It tastes really good. I ordered it to make Bubble Tea and it worked out really well.
"I drink a lot of green tea, which I typically import from Japan.  I'm used to high quality green tea as I lived in Japan for two years.  I thought I'd give this tea a try. Simple:  Yuck...tastes like alfalfa.  For those who think this is quality green tea, they haven't haven't tasted good Netto Gyokuro tea.  There's no comparison. I guess, there's a reason this price is so low."
"I have tried all of the flavors and have to say that chocolate is my least favorite. However, the vanilla, pb creme, and wild berry are all awesome.  The wild berry is almost like a strawberry birthday cake made into a wafer bar.  There is a pb fudge that is just ok. They should sell a variety box!  Also, get these shipped in cooler months. And I recommend storing in freezer. :)  And i forgot the cookies n creme.... Also delicious!"
"I noticed on this coffee that I am not supposed to shake it, so I wondered if this was why it didn't taste very sweet, despite having a good deal of sugar in it.  It tasted decent for what it was, but I am not sure if I would buy it in a store if I saw it."
My dog has an allergy to chicken products so I have to search high and low for a good price on the various LID diets. We were previously using the Duck and Potato variety of Natural Balance with no issues. I found this variety on Amazon for a better price than was available at my local pet store. My dog eats this food with abandon and has had no allergy flares (not that any were expected). Highly recommended!
Very tasty the only bad thing is that there isn't to many of them in the box.
"It's nothing like a handful of chocolate covered oreos (they come out around the holidays) or a reeses peanut butter cup, or even a tagalong girl scout cookie, with a tall glass of milk or a cup of coffee. So, when the opportunity came to try the new the ""Peanut Butter Fudge Cr&egrave;me"" I jumped all over it. Now, I am thinking I jumped on it a little tooooooo quick. What I was expecting is a ""combination oreo holiday cookie with a little peanut butter added for good measure. What I received on the other hand was something very different.<br /><br />First, if you are expecting something similar to those ""chocolate (milk or white) covered oreos"" that come out around the holidays, with a tab bit of peanut butter you will be GREATLY disappointed. [I envisioned a plain 2 cookie cookie with peanut butter in the middle, dipped in milk chocolate. Meaning a variation on the old, well loved theme of their holiday cookie.] However, this cookie contained a really  slim wafer like oreo cookie, with a layer (perhaps too thick) of smooth peanut butter, covered in dark or fudge chocolate. What makes the holiday cookie (in my mind) a success (it is perfection), is what made this one new oreo cookie fall short. Don't get me wrong, this was not marketed in any form or fashion as the holiday cookie, but that is what I was thinking when I read the description. The main difference is that the holiday oreo (and maybe I shouldn't compare it to that) is a whole oreo dipped in white or milk chocolate. Maybe a better comparison (instead of the holiday oreo) would be maybe the Girl Scout Tagalongs (whose cookie is definitely thicker than this wafer) but closer to the taste. And while I enjoy peanut butter in a Reese's peanut butter cup or a GS Tagalong, I thought this had a little too much peanut butter, almost to the point of being overpowering. You should know that the flavor that lingers the longest in your mouth is the peanut butter, while I think it should have been the chocolate flavor. Maybe it could have been because the cookie is wafer thin, but while a thicker cookie would have masked (or toned down) the flavor of the peanut butter, it probably wouldn't have completely muted it. I also think that a sweeter milk chocolate, versus whatever kind this was....which seemed more of a dark chocolate/fudge, would have made complemented the cookie better. Overall, I guess I was just a little disappointed because I was looking so forward to a tasty treat. This is definitely not that little something that I would reach for to complete my meal (although the last thing I need is a cookie). But my 9 and 12 year olds gobbled them up."
"This is an amazing product. PB2 tastes so good I didn't miss the fat. It is easy to mix. I used it blended into recipes and use it on toast or fruit.<br />A must in any healthy, dieters cupboard!"
"This is delicious and healthy too! I use it mostly on sandwiches, crackers, apples, and bananas.  I wish it came in a bigger container."
"Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea makes a reasonable strong cup of tea with just a couple minutes steeping. The taste of the tea however is overwhelmed by the spice note, most notably the black pepper and the mint. While the pepper gives a nice warmth to the beverage the rest of the spice family sticks around far too long. I was tasting this tea hours after drinking it. The aftertaste was mildly unpleasant.<br />I don't know that the few cups I've had so far revitalized me. The brew has far less caffeine than a decent cup of coffee so it didn't perk me up any more than any other tea or coffee. I just wasn't impressed. There are far better mint teas out there. I think the only time I might enjoy this tea is if I had a cold or the flu."
"Its simply not worth the money. I have been trying NOX products for some time now and find that most of them are a waste of money. Im 38 years old and a gym veteran at this point in very good shape and believe me. nothing substitutes for simple food. I try these products to 'boost' my moodin the morning workouts. Wether or not i am getting vital nutrients to my muscles faster with these products or not, ill continue with simple creatine and anti catabolic supps like Xtend. Sorry Labrada two thumbs down for this one."
"My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)"
"This coffee is so great that I have had little fantasies of getting a cup, lying in bed, pouring the beans all over me and tossing them in the air so I can get more of the aroma.  If you are a cherry lover, this is the thing for you.  I may have to visit Traverse City in one of their 4 weeks of summer just to get a taste of the place that creates such juicy tantalizing visions and tastes."
"I usually make homemade rum cakes for Christmas gifts.  This Christmas (2011) my schedule was hectic, so I decided to purchase the Tortuga Caribbean Gold Bar Rum Cake instead of baking.  I bought several as gifts, but I also bought one for myself to try out (taste test).  This rum cake is moist, light, and there is rum generously soaking the bottom of the cake.  DELICIOUS.  I was tempted to not give out the gifts and eat all the cakes, but relented and decided I could order more for my own pleasure.  I highly recommend this as a gift - or be selfish and enjoy the cake all to yourself."
The Java Podz coffee pads do not fit well in the Senseo coffee maker. One pad fits in the two cup holder. It makes a very weak cup of coffee. I ordered a large supply and will probably throw them out.
"This tea tastes good, I use them at work in a reused soda bottle. Saves a bunch of money over a whole bottle of product. Some people do not like the flavor, I'm ok with it."
"Product is good and my dog used to love them, but all of a sudden stopped, then I realized the reason was that the last batch sent to me were expired. For that reason I won't be buying again."
"i am a huge fan of freeze-dried fruit, and i have tried almost every brand.  this is the best.  i recommend any flavor of brothers-all-natural.  i eat them with yogurt like chips and dip.  try it and you will be hooked!"
"Five solstice gum is my favorite gum of all time.  Even my dentist was impressed that I started having less and less cavities b/c I chew them after coffee/lunch!  However, there was one order where the gum was stale, so that's why I'm going to have to leave it as a 3 star.  It didnt' say it was expired, but the gum color was tinted a not-as-dark green and when I bit into it, it was very soft, almost seemed moist like you're biting into butter/marshmallow.  Otherwise, given that you don't end up unlucky like me, you're definitely getting a great deal here for great gum!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />MC"
"I tried RevHoney a few weeks ago and have been drinking it ever since.  The drink has a great taste without the crash that the others do (i.e. Monster, Rockstar, Sobe, Redbull, etc...).  I drink a RevHoney usually before working out and get a release of energy that helps me sustain all through my workout...Great Product!"
A very rich coffee especially for a decaf and perfect for those that like larger cups of coffee but are trying to restrict caffeine intake. I find that Amazon has many more choices than most for the K Cup and most of the time better prices. It is nice not to be so restricted with the decaf choices and this one is a tasty one but definitely bold!
"Besides Timothy's, ""Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino Single Serve Cups"" is another favorite K-Cup coffee to drink if your looking to stock up.. Taste fantastic, is just the right strength to get you going when you need to but not so strong where it gives you the shakes.. Highly recomend ""Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino Single Serve Cups"" if your looking for a new K-Cup to try..."
"There are 3 flavors - both my cats loved one flavor (whitefish), one would eat all flavors (though not happy about the salmon), and one cat rejected 2 out of 3.  The can size is perfect for picky cats - less waste."
AMAZING!  I love this stuff!  Uncovers glowing beautiful skin everytime!  I use it once a week for a real 'treat' pick me up.  Fabulous product!!!
"After trying a few other brands of gluten free pretzels, these are our favorites, especially for our 17 year old son.  He has actually been known to say ""Hey, those pretzels are mine!  You can eat whatever you want, so hands off!!"".  Yummy and worth the extra $$$."
"Excellent product - absolutely love this cookie mix - makes excellent chocolate chip cookies!  I've tried other brands, but Krusteaz Chocolate Chunk is the best!"
"""Blends smooth and creamy for a sweet tasting protein""  is in the item description. I don't know who wrote this but they must not have ever smelled or tasted this stuff! Based on the description, I purchased a few of these bags. They come vacuum sealed. The color of the powder is a light olive green. The taste is a combination of powdered sawdust, wheatgrass and every dark green health food store drink you've ever had. The only reason it gave it a star at all is well, there's no choice for zero, and it probably does have decent nutritional properties. But while forcing myself to drink this stuff, I got flashbacks from 3 years old when I was forced to eat spinach. The good news is Amazon refunded the cost of the purchase even though it's a ""non-refundable"" product. You have to call them to do it. They didn't even want me to send back the unopened bags! But I really want to return them. It seems a shame to have to throw them away."
"This snack blend is the best! I tried it on the recommendation of a friend, and have come to love it. It's perfect alone, but I enjoy putting the mix on salads. It definitely spices them up a bit, and the flavor is amazing. I have become a big fan of this product, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks."
"Six weeks ago I bought this for $19.99, now it is priced at $49.99. What is going on? This is just wrong."
"These are fantastic gummy worms! They're allergen-free and have 100% RDA Vitamin C. I only wish they weren't so expensive for how many you get in a bag. Basically one bag equals one serving, maybe two if you're not very hungry. I think the worms have more flavor than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIVCW"">Surf Sweets Gummy Bears, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>, but maybe that's because the worms are bigger. If you like sugar-crusted gumdrops, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTG6CO"">Surf Sweets Organic Fruity Bears, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. They also make <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTG6E2"">Surf Sweets Organic Jelly Beans, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>."
The product was just what I expected. A large amount of yummy candy corn! I purchased it for the candy buffet I had at my wedding reception & we still have some leftover. My husband is now eating a little every day.
"Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice."
I had received a sample of the mandarin spice and it was so good. I ordered this and definately not the same. Tasteless. I will go back to the tea bags.
"While I do recall these might not be as delectable as the full-fat version, I'd have to have them side by side to say for sure, and even then I believe the difference probably wouldn't be enough to raise a fuss over. I like these so much I eat them right out of the can. Then there's the added bonus of left over gravy! I like to use the gravy over whole wheat egg noodles, or add to veggie broth when rehydrating tvp. The gravy freezes well until needed, and the FriChick itself stays fresh in the fridge for up to a week once opened. On it's own I personally don't think it actually tastes like chicken, but it quite yummy in it's own right."
This cereal is the best cereal around.  Has great flavor and my whole family loves it.  Wish i could find it on my store.
"The bars taste good, but they are REALLY crunchy! It's almost impossible to eat them and not make a huge mess of crumbs--definitely not good for taking on the go to eat in the car!"
I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
"My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally ""stew,"" with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer."
IDIOT. I TOLD YOU TWICE I WANT TO CANCEL THE ORDER. YOU BASICALLY JUST IGNORED MY REQUEST AND SENT ME THE ITEM.
"I purchased the whole beans and used my coffee roaster as usual. But it didn't matter how I roasted it, different temperatures, different times It was always bitter and with a taste of burned coffee. Ended wasting most of the coffee. I would not recommend."
"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee.
"If you are a Vienna Finger fanatic, order these.  They satisfy my late night sugar cravings.  They are not too sweet, but just sweet enough.  If they get too sweet, just scrape the icing off, or half of the icing off.  But they are delicious, an excellent snack.  Try with milk or coffee."
Still haven't received the product purchased over a month ago! Sent an email to the company and never got a response back. Is it ever going to ship to me?????
"This is my favorite tea. I buy LOTS of it. But this was like someone hired their kid sister to cram a box full of old tea bags and ship it to me. Not impressed, Stash."
"I thought I was getting a good deal on this water. I love it so much, and I'm trying to get into the habit of drinking water. I've never seen bottles this small of any kind of water. The smallest size in the store is around $1 per bottle. I misread the label while trying to figure out what size the bottles were for the purchase, and I feel stupid. A case is too heavy for me to carry home from the store, so I thought I'd check my trusty Amazon. I will have to come up with something else. I'd return this water, but the mistake is mine. Still, I'm baffled that someone would charge this much for water. (This review is for the 11.15-ounce size of Fiji Water.)"
"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."
"This is without a doubt the best 70% chocolate I have ever tasted. Way above the so-called top brands, such as Valrhona, E. Guittard, Michel Cluizel, etc. The texture is smooth and creamy, and the taste is full of complexity - rich, but not overbearing. It has a nice espresso finish, but no bitterness, just a perfect blend. I not only eat this chocolate out of hand, but I also bake with it, and use it to make chocolate ice cream. You could not ask for better results. To summarize, this is a very unique, complex chocolate with a nice round taste, and tons of depth. Highly recommended."
"These raw food bars don't look that good, but they taste great.  I've tried several flavors and they are all excellent."
"We are not gluten free but my MIL is.  I bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit...  and then never got around to making it.  We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.  We ate the entire loaf at one meal (with bean soup, which I keep wishing my kids would like, but they won't...  so they ate a lot of bread...) so I can't attest to its keeping qualities, but fresh from the oven it was great.  It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.  I may try some of the tweaks suggested next time.  It does call for an odd amount of eggs, that would be the only complaint."
"Previously, these lemon wafer cookies were sold at Wal Mart; however, they no longer carry them.  Recently, I discovered that Trader Joe's carried a chocolate version and I inquired if they carried the lemon but no, they discontinued carrying the lemon as well.  So, I googled and found that Amazon.com was a source for the cookies.  YES, I can now satisfy that craving for a truly lip smacking little lemon wafer.  While I ordered only one box of them the first time, I will be ordering two boxes the next time--I have a friend and her husband who also enjoy puckering up!  Try them, you will love them!"
I adopted a cat who had issues with the digestive system when I first go him. I couldn't find a brand that we would like for more than a few days. He has been eating PetGuard for 4 months now and loves it. He licks it clean every time and he has not had a single issue with his digestive system.
"I always keep Porcinis around, and have previously purchased them in bulk from high-end grocers like Whole Foods. When I ran out this time, I decided to order them these from Amazon. They are easily the highest quality dried Porcinis I've ever found. Large pieces, delicious flavor, not overly dry. Would definitely order again."
"I've bought Sugar Daddys a number of times over the past years, each time being so  disappointed with the consistency and flavor. When I've called the Tootsie Roll company Customer Service, they've told me there's been no change in the recipe and that they're made the same as always.  Unfortunately, that representative never suggested it might be an issue of FRESHNESS! I ordered a box of 24 suckers in late June 2010 through DAB Nutrition on Amazon, and have been blissfully happy since they arrived.  It is the same rich caramel flavor I remembered.  So, be sure your sucker is fresh or else you'll have a crumbly, poor quality experience!  Arrived quickly as requested. No problems. Thank you!"
"The soup i ordered was fantastic and i love it, but if i was to order this again i would hope that i would not have to wait as long as this time to get it. I am somewhat  confused to wether i should ever try to reorder this product again?"
"Let me start the review by saying that I have not purchased this from Amazon, so I don't know of any packaging issues that may happen.  However, my review is of the oatmeal itself, not of the seller.<br />I grew up eating this oatmeal, and it is the absolute best.  It's hard to decide whether to leave the dinosaurs in their eggs or take them out of the oatmeal beforehand; I usually take the eggs out, make the oatmeal, and eat the eggs separately (This may not be the best idea, because the sugary ""egg"" around the dinosaur is a large part of what sweetens the oatmeal).  The oatmeal itself is delicious, and tastes very authentic.  The dinosaur eggs were a great incentive when I was younger to eat a healthy breakfast, and they make the entire meal exceptionally better.  Perhaps it's because I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to the dinosaur egg oatmeal, but I absolutely adore these and will buy them as long as I can!"
"Other brands are grainy, not as smooth, nor have the deep dark chocolate flavor of Donchels.  Don't consider any others!"
"Wonderful taste - refreshing and thirst quenching!<br />Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
"Confession time. I haven't personally tasted Newman's Own Organics new dog treats but they smell way yummier than most dog treats. (My dog Sheila has tasted them and she quickly started groveling for more. It was pathetic.) Seriously, I don't have to taste these to know that they are good. The Newman's Own Corp. and its spin-off Newman's Own Organics have been making quality food for pets and people for almost 30 years. Their organic products are independently certified as organic by Oregon Tilth, a third party certifying agency for organic farmers. Among other things, their certification means that the products used by Newman's Own Organics are grown on farms that do not use artificial pesticides or synthetic chemicals of any kind during the production of their products. In the case of their Lamb & Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, that includes organic, lamb, barley, carrots, apples and molasses.<br /><br />I'm not seriously into organic products myself but there is precious little regulation when it comes to what goes into pet products. I am glad to see that some people take my dog's health seriously.<br /><br />As consumers, we should also remember that Paul Newman and his companies has given over $200 million to charity over the years. Who better to give your money to?"
"I made these for my gluten-allergic girl, and she loved them. I can make them from scratch, but sometimes they come out slimy in the center. (If you've baked gluten-free, you know what I mean!) These came out GREAT, just like the regular ones. I can't say if they're totally gluten-free, but they work for us!"
I am really impressed with the Tanka Buffalo sticks. Great flavor without being too spicy and a great post work out treat! A little dry but otherwise perfect.
"My twins recently got a little picky on the baby food... We tried this one, and they both love it.  They are now 10 mos old.<br /><br />My twins love it!"
"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem."
I prefer the Raspberry flavor; I think Orange flavor can<br />be used to flavor dishes or create sorbet.
This stuff is awesome!<br /><br />Great Taste<br />Rich Roast<br />Perfect Vanilla after-bite<br />Smooth and Silky<br /><br />All in all this would make an excellent replacement to your everyday cup of coffee on a cold winters morning/evening!
"Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up ""health food"" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets."
"Have purchased this many times over and totally love it! Can't wait to try the other new flavors that Emeril has to offer! Very happy!<br /><br />Automatic delivery is the best! Great price, awesome ship time; thank you Amazon!!!"
"I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.  It came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill.  I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends."
"The chile is amazing.Great smokey hot flavor, and one heck of a lingering bite.<br />The heat is sweltering and lasts a very long time.<br />You have to rehydrate the chile properly to reach the maximum potential of heat.<br />I loooove this chile.<br /><br />As far as the seller goes....Marked as shipped on the 1st. Post office got electronic info on 5th. By the 10th when i saw it still hadnt even been taken to post office i wrote and asked when theyd ship it. They said something about employees and refunded $2 of the $6.00 and then shipped out item that day (the 10th). I appreciate the partial refund, but this was needed for a chili cook off thats come and gone (i still won 1st)<br /><br />I just figured that anyone looking to buy this chile deserves to know that it may not arrive on time, but once it does, its fantastic."
"The flavor here is surprising!  I have had lavender chocolate before and always found it overwhelmingly floral -- almost like soap.  Here the taste is more herbal, and while I have no idea what lime blossom extract is, I certainly think it must be what gives this bar it's bright, citrusy note.  The citrus cuts the floral taste of the lavender and makes this an especially pleasant bar."
"I will admit, I have forced my cat to eat all kinds of varieties of cat foods so as to make him not too picky, but this formula is by far his favorite dry food.  The other grain-free brand I tried was Wellness, and he only picked at that.  This food is obviously high quality.  If you're into your kitty, you should be feeding him/her this food."
Sort of like surf 'n turf for felines!  A nice balance if you don't want your cats to overload on fish. The cats in my house have never refused Chicken & Tuna.
"I found that this tea really helped increase my milk supply. It tasted a little funny at first, but I quickly got used to it. The price on Amazon is unbeatable, especially if you use subscribe and save."
There are all kinds of Hard Salami but I happen to like this brand the best and live in a smaller city where it is hard to find.  Was very pleased to find it at Amazon! Taste great with Gouda Cheese and apples or pears.
"This combination shampoo-conditioner does the shampoo part ok, but the built in conditioner does not leave your hair feeling nourished and smooth the way a stand-alone conditioner will. It pretty much leaves your hair feeling the same way after you shampoo but did not condition afterwards. For that reason I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />Another negative, this shampoo arrived leaking with liquid spilling out. The container does not look cracked but the seams on the lid which go around the entire bottle is a weak joint. For the poor product packaging alone I wouldn't recommend this."
"These are my absolute favorite gummy bears.  They aren't soft and spongy like most brands; instead they are chewy and melt in your mouth.  Also, all of the flavors are delicious-- i usually don't like eating cherry or lemon flavored candies because they tend to taste very artificial, but in the case with Haribo brand gummies, it feels like all of the flavors taste great, and it's hard for me to choose a ""favorite.""<br /><br />The reason i decided to buy this 5 pound bag is because I realized halfway through the school year that i've been buying at least one or two bags of the bears at the school bookstore per week, and decided that it would be a better buy to buy the candy in bulk."
I was given a track number and told it was delivered to my POBOX.  It never happened.  I received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder.
"The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for ""highlighting"" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra."
"Love the strong bold taste. So good you can get two cups from one pod. I have a latte cup and fill it , first cup large size than small size. Gives you one large wonderful cup of coffee.<br />I love the convenience of ordering at Amazon and the price is the best."
"I'm a Celiac (require gluten-free foods: no wheat, barley, or rye) and it turns out the ""food"" I miss most is Twizzlers.  These red scotty dogs bring joy and red licorice back into my life!<br /><br />The flavor is more like Super Rope than Twizzler, but it makes me plenty happy.<br /><br />The dogs arrive in 2 sealed bags of 2.5lbs.  I've had a bag open for nearly a month now (am storing them in ziplock), and the dogs haven't become stale or hard.  The texture is pretty soft and will stick to your teeth a little.<br /><br />Yay for Gimbals and their gluten-free production!"
"I am vegan, and use no butter or milk- they make up with just water, and less is better, you can add more if the potatoes are too thick- these are Better than homemade and take only minutes! If you have a loved one who lives alone, this is a Perfect Gift- they can have homemade mashed potatoes and they keep great in the fridge for re/heating!<br />I hope everyone has these in their pantry for that quick meal assist!"
"Chocolate is our dessert and as a family, we have chocolate at least once a day.  We really like this bar. Our favorite chocolates include German and Belgian chocolates, Theo chocolates because of their sustainability and Raw chocolate bars.  The Tortilla Lime and Salt Komforte chocolate bar is a new favorite. We're looking forward to trying the other Komforte chocolates!"
"These flakes are incredibly hot and well milled so a small amount envelopes a large amount of food in very spicy pepper.  Even if you enjoy pepper in every meal, it would probably take a few years to finish the entire 10 oz. jar.  I always sneeze as I am cooking with it, not sure why.  I strongly suggest these flakes to true hot pepper lovers, but warn others to proceed with caution."
"Rather bland tasting, although I havent tried to use it in some of the suggested ways. For a cooking oil it probably is OK. But it is expensive, so I don't think I'll buy it again.<br />The shipping was fast and I'll always buy other products from Amazon due to excellent service and prices."
"TOTALLY ORGASMIC.  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted.  signed up for the subscribe and save option.  the case contained 15(FIFTEEN, FULL SIZED BAGS) OF CHIPS.  the price per unit equals $1.73  per package.  that is not even the cost of plain chips.  if you add the free shipping and the fast delivery, this deal is a steal.  so run like you stole something over to your computer and order the SPICY THAI CHIPS.  p.s.  even if you paid the going price of $30.00, you are still ahead of the curve.  ENJOY"
I thoroughly enjoyed the dried pineapple. In fact I devoured them over a single weekend as it was very addictive and you can keep popping these in your mouth like candy. These are actually very sweet but not of a saturating nature.<br /><br />Happy with the purchase. Only wish the packets had more than 3 ounces per bag.
This tea tastes nasty.  Maybe I just dont like sage but it made me gag!
"After searching high and low for this awesome treat, I was able to find them at SMART & FINAL. They have them year round for $5.99/48 count."
"My wife and I were given a tin of this some years back and thoroughly enjoyed the taste and ease of preperaton.  We lucked into this product just recently and decided to give it another try.  After several years between the two events, we heartily approve of this second taste-test.  Good eating!"
"I'm very sensitive to caffeine even to decaf but can drink decaf early in the day but not late afternoon or at night. In the winter, I like to drink something hot at night and to me Pero is a perfect beverage for that since they took Postum off the market and can be a nice alternative if you wanted something a little heavier than herbal tea.  It doesn't have the bitterness of coffee, and is flavorful with a nutty background taste.  I tried Cafix at the same time and was surprised that I like Pero better since Cafix has a couple of more ingredients.  Just a warning - it's doesn't taste like Postum."
"I thought my daughters would be ready for a classic, and they were.  Except for a few foul words this movie was safe.  Some of the animation is now antiquated but the wit and humor is there.  Say it 3 times and enjoy!"
I don't know how some of these people could give the CHOCOLATE Green Plus bars only one star?!  I guess it's possible that there are a small percentage of people out there who have very different taste buds.  Maybe they wanted to write about the ones without the chocolate?  Those I could see how people who do not normally use herbal medicine or eat healthy may think they're no good.<br /><br />The ChocGP bars are awesome - the ingredients are amazing and for not having any sugar - HELLO!  I just love them.
"Dasuquin was the brand of glucosamine supplement recommended by our vet. Our daughter found the best price on Amazon. It's worked wonderfully well for our dear old dog, a 10 yr old Blue heeler. He soon became less painful, & now has the spring back in his step! We learned from our vet that he can stay on the maintenance dose of 1 chew daily, or increase to 2 chews a day for when he has more activity."
I'm now a full convert to the current coconut water food trend.  This particular brand has a good price here on Amazon.
"Not only are the Redskins real Redskins and not little peanuts with their coats on, the service is incredible...  I mentioned a slight shipping issue when initially reviewing, and they sent me a complimentary 40 oz can...<br /><br />  I cannot recommend them HIGHLY enough.<br /><br />Thank you very much,<br /><br />Bill Condon"
"This is a fantastic Chai Masala. I am very picky when it comes to tea but love this one. It is very strong, so if you a sensitive to caffeine beware. I usually have it with plenty of agave and it comes out wonderful - a great way to start the morning."
"I buy these because they are my wife's current favorite candy.  I can get them locally but they cost more then twice as much, even after shipping costs, and are not as fresh as the ones I get through Amazon.  The ones I get are soft, fresh, have more flavor then the exact same ones I can get locally that have sat in a plastic container waiting to be purchased.  I usually split the five pound bags into one pound ziplock bags but if kept from the air they  stay fresh and soft."
"I am so happy Amazon has finally started to ship Hayashi. It is so hard to find here in the US, and when you do find it, it is absurdly expensive and almost expired. This stuff is like a Japanese beef stew. It comes in a block rue form to make what is called Hayashi Rice. All you do is cook some thinly cut beef with some sliced onion and carrots (you can add other vegetables if you wish to experiment) and then add the correct amount of water, bring to boil and add the appropriate amount of Hayashi rue. It has a very smooth taste and tastes as if it originates from a tomato base (but without the normal tangy tomato flavor). Most people pour it on top of Japanese rice like you would Japanese curry. If you're looking for a warm and easy to make meal, this is it. One box of hayashi will serve a large family or provide a small family with enough for two meals. This pack includes 10 boxes so you'll be hard pressed to run out of the stuff quickly (unless you live in my house). The box includes two blister packs of the rue. Each blister pack can be divvied up to make 4 blocks of rue in case you want to make an individual size serving. Each block of the four out of one blister pack is supposed to be equal to one large serving.<br /><br />I ate this stuff all the time when I lived in Japan. It was my favorite dish and my wife would make it for me on a weekly basis. Now I can have it on a regular basis here in the states. Thanks Amazon!"
This one is my favorite of Amy's soups. It is vegan and delicious! You can use it as a dip it is so thick!
"I ordered these because I never heard of them before and was hoping they were more sour then Warheads but they were about a little less sour, Not many Lemon flavored (Out of 3 LBS) in the package which was the best tasting one overall they are a good buy if you want something a tad less then Warheads."
"This is great for your little one, no artificial flavors or additives. But I found out after buying the stage 1, that stage 2 is cheaper & you get more."
"I purchased these K-Cups for myself at our office based on the low price per cup. I didn't have very high expectations as these are roughly half the cost of most K-Cups. Despite not having much hope for this product to be any good, I am extremely happy with it! My coffee mug is extra large and I usually run each K-Cup twice, once on medium and once on small, to fill my mug. The flavor is strong and appealing, and the caffeine boost is welcoming. When I brew a cup, the aroma fills the office and my co-workers gravitate towards the machine to make their own coffee with their twice as expensive K-Cups.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product based on its value-to-cost ratio!"
"A very nice white tea that is very drinkable. Just make sure you know and compare the size of this tea... 1.5 ounce packages.<br />This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. All in all I am happy with the purchase."
"It is interesting how I had written a review and it was rejected. I looked over the guidelines and there is nothing that was even close to a problem, so here is the benign rewrite of it:<br /><br />Pricing is just not that great considering I can buy it at full price at a number of local retailers for about 67-cents a bottle. If it was the same price or less, then I would consider buying it online. So until that happens, I will have to pass as this is not as good of a deal as it should be."
"I like this salt, but it is very coarse, so you need a very agressive grinder of a mortar and pestal to use it for the table."
"Whoa! The label says ""light, non-greasy"" but this is actually worse than just dumping olive oil on your hair! Which would probably be better for it--the first ingredient here is mineral oil. I used it on my daughter's hair, and we've had to wash it out three times now. Ugh - the rest of it is going in the trash."
"I had these brownies sent to a friend in Las Vegas for her birthday.  She said they were the best brownies she has ever had.  They arrived in a beautiful box, and very fresh.  The shipping only took a few days.  I would recommend this product to anyone with a sweet tooth!"
"The Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood Ground Coffee, 8.8-Ounce Package is an excellent buy and taste great first thing in the morning."
"Both of my kiddos liked Good Start.  As a matter of fact, my baby girl will ONLY take this formula.  It's very good, and very affordable."
"This coffee was great and is true to its extra bold status. In comparison to the ""Black Magic"" this one has an extra kick. My only complaint is that the cups are shipped in the box, without packaging and some of them were bent."
Fifty dollars?  You've got to be kidding me.  I could eat at a 5 star restaurant for that.
"We had used this product before and know it's of great quality. We use ground coriander a lot in our cooking. It's always fresh smelling. The subscribe and save price at Amazon was excellent, and will continue to buy again."
"Organic-pure- non GMO !!! I eat rice every day, almost, for years and years ,it is my favorite food and I always looking for high quality . This rice is excellent. I just add water,olive oil and himalayan salt and place it one hour in the oven . Delicious !!! I am now on the second ordering and I will order again. Very nutty, tasty and smells soooo nice !!! The best ! Highly recommended! Thank you !"
"Came as an 8-pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about 1/4 inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!"
can't find this product in stores anymore.  sure glad to have found it<br /><br />thanks
"I love Jet Fuel! It gives me the extra KICK i need in the morning. It's a good, strong cup of coffee without having that ""star-bucks"" bitterness. Absolutely wonderful. I buy it all the time and recommend others to do the same. I just wish it came in bigger boxes."
"Firstly, Rustichella d'abruzzo is the very best pasta asciutta available.  For years Amazon has been offering it in four packs for $17.50 or so and the prices have been rising to about $22. If you buy something else (another 4-pack of pasta is what I buy) the price comes to under $6 for a half kilo ( 17.6 oz) of the factory made product. Handmade shapes are generally double in price.<br /><br />Looking today all the 4 packs are on an out of stock--please notify me basis.<br /><br />This particular offering is $6.25, a price that is competitive to Whole Foods and the like.  But adding 7.25 shipping makes it $14/lb and at that price I'll east filet, lobster, and get out my Atlas and start making my own.<br /><br />Please, Amazon, bring pack the 4-packs!"
"Don Pepino pizza sauce is the best canned pizza sauce bar none!  DO NOT LET THE GIMMICKY LABEL DETER YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS PRODUCT!  I was turned on to this sauce by a dear friend of mine who pointed it out to me in Swiacki's Store in Philly:<br />Swiacki Meats<br />3623 Salmon Sreet<br />Philadelphia, PA 19134<br />This is the BEST place to buy kielbas or any type of sausage in any form by the way, and they always stock amazing goods and groceries there as well.  My very first can was purchased there.  Buy local if you can!<br /><br />Back to the sauce!  They only use vine ripened Jersey tomatoes and I do not know what else they put in their sauce, but it is amazing!  I bake my own pizza now and their sauce is the sole reason!  The flavor and texture combination will literally produce ""WOW!"" results from guests at your dinner table.  Beleive me, you would never guess the quality of the contents of this CAN!!! (not a glass jar) by the label.  This stuff is amazing and you really need to try it for yourself.  I will step off the soapbox now!  Try it and you'll never look at another jar of pizza sauce the same way.  It's just that good!"
"This would come as a shock to anyone who knows me, but , yes we have found a GF product that is actually decent. Not just decent..it's GOOD. This is one of the few GF copy products that is actually as good if not better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />they do take a bit longer to cook, you need to be careful to cook them thoroughly inside....low heat....also for some reason when you pre-make the mix it mysteriously thickens profoundly overnight....but anyway it is a solid hot breakfast for a hungry family.<br /><br />This mix can also be used as a filler within other products or mixes in the place of flour. It has a leavener so whatever you add it to will puff up a bit.<br /><br />I rather resent having to pay so much just to feed my family pancakes...but since that is my reality, they might as well taste decent. Go Go Pamela!"
"We traveled to St. Lucia on holiday and this hot sauce was served with one of our meals. After that initial taste we asked for it by name everywhere that we went. It has become a favorite amongst our family and friends. It has some definite heat, but the flavor is unique and quite good with a large variety of foods."
My husband and I just love the Terra Sweet Potato Chips with Sea Salt. Our local stored stopped selling these and now only carry the Sweet Potato Chips with no salt added which we do not like as much. I'm really glad to have found these chips available on Amazon to help satisfy our craving.
I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee.  I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get.  Two ounces of coffee for $8 is not a fair price.
"Having also reviewed the shampoo which accompanies this conditioner, with comments which apply to the products used together, I will summarize my previous review.<br />Clear Scalp and Hair conditioner is packaged very nicely in a bottle which is inverted and opens from the bottom. It is very easy to get the conditioner out of this bottle, unlike some conditioner bottles.<br />The conditioner has virtually no odor, and feels soft and creamy.<br />It distributes well and rinses easily from my hair.<br />My hair is nice and soft after blow drying and flat ironing, although it is a little fly-away.<br />I really like this shampoo/conditioner combination, but it does not help with frizziness, which my hair has a tendency to, especially since I live in very humid Florida.<br />I will be trying some leave in anti frizz products, which, if they work, will make these products really good.<br />Both the shampoo and the conditioner are priced very reasonably."
"I grew up in the tropics where the best shade at the beach is from a palm tree. Of course, you gotta look up first to inspect if there are coconuts above. It might be dangerous when ripe. Oh! but locals climb palm trees to harvest the fruit.  With a machete they open up the top and voila, a super refreshing 40 to 50 calories drink.<br /><br />Zico water reminds me of the flavor tasted. I purchase it in Safeway and/or Trader Joe's ( I live in California now). Relatively cheap and likely the real thing without so much processing.<br /><br />I recommend it. Trust me. It is good. ;0)"
"Have used these bags for over 2 years now and have remained completely satisfied.  I've never had one tear or break and I have a 90 pound dog that makes relatively-sized ""deposits"". Yes, they cost more than plastic bags (many of which we can all get for free), but I feel it is something that I can spend my money on that helps the environment as these bags breakdown (as do doggie deposits) more quickly."
"These chips are the best snack since the invention of chips themselves. They are actual baked potato chips, not potato powder or potato starch. And after you see the nutrition facts you wont feel guilty eating them!! Try them and you will be sold!"
"In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Ovaltine from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Ovaltine is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, Ovaltine is the most chocolately of all 3 and a great comfort drink for cold nights. I like it more than simply hot chocolate because it's not as sweet and has a slight malty flavor to it. Best of all, you can control the taste because you can adjust the amounts of sugar and Ovaltine you add."
These are my favorite crackers.  They have a nutty flavor and are very healthy and taste wonderful with absolutely anything spread on them.  My friends and family and I are addicted and will continue to order more and more.
Easier than getting my favorite (Trader Joe's) in smaller bottles (only) - and ALMOST as good. Sugar is listed as an ingredient - shouldn't be.
"I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress."
"I order these treats in bulk since they are a favorite of my Boston Terrier.  She is allergic to a number of things, and these don't contain any ingredients that she is allergic to.  They are a little bit on the expensive side, but they are totally worth it!"
These are great. They are so tasty & with 10 grams of protein per 1 oz bag they are a super easy way for us non-chef's to get protein. I will say that they aren't as filling as the pretzel sticks but they do taste darn good!!!
I have been pleased with everything I have tried in the Blue Buffalo line.  These bars are particularly pleasing to both my puppy and my geriatric pooch.  I have also tried the salmon and the chicken flavors and they were also well received by dogs and owner alike.
"We are new to the gluten-free world but found this bread unexceptable.  Less than 1 star, but that was not an option.  Whether fresh, toasted or grilled it was dry, crumbly, had an odor and strange after taste.  After more checking we found ""Sami"" millet & flax seed bread. You have to toast or grill it, but it is FANTASTIC.  We are enjoying toast with breakfast and toasted or grilled sandwiches again.  So don't bother with the Ener-G look for Sami"
"I prefer jerky on the tender side, so I really enjoyed the original Wild Ride natural style, but I also don't have any hangups about additives, so the new Cowboy Strips line totally blows away the flavor of the bigger brands I'm used to; same tenderness as the organic Wild Ride stuff, but with even more taste.  And if you haven't tried the Pepper yet, you're missing out!"
"These seeds are so good! They are roasted to perfection and just have a great flavor. The smaller size bag keeps me from eating way too much, otherwise i would im a sunflower seed addict! Don't get me wrong the package is not single serving still, but it is nice to be not a huge pack. Plus i think the humidity gets to my open seed bags and ruins them so i like the smaller ones for that reason as well!"
The flavor is excellent.  My partner who does not have food allergies loves the pancakes that you can make with this mix. He prefers them to the wheat counter part. I do too. This product is a must have for anyone who is gluten intolerent. This mix is versitle. I have tried many of Pamela's recipes and they all come out.
"I've tried almost every energy drink out there and some work and some don't, but for the most part they all crash an hour or so later and leave you scrambling for some food or more energy drinks.  A never ending, ugly cycle.  I tried 5 Hour Energy and have been using it ever since.  It is truly a fantastic product.  If you need long lasting energy that wont make you feel hyped up or bring you crashing down an hour or two later, this is the product for you."
"Well I asked both of my dogs and they said thanks for putting us back on Royal Canin!! We spent a year trying other dog food but they do much better on Royal Canin its developed just for their breed, yes it seems expensive for 10lbs. but thats a months worth of food so its not expensive and their Vet told me to put them back on it. I also like that its delivered to my door."
"I love creme brulee. If I were to drown in a vat of it, I think that'd be a pretty good way to go. So, naturally, when I see something that is flavored like creme brulee but without the calories, I get excited.<br /><br />I got excited about this coffee.<br /><br />Now, it's good coffee, as far as coffee goes. Nothing wrong with that. But if someone served me this and asked me to identify the flavor, creme brulee wouldn't even make it on the list. It's almost got a bitter taste to it -- even Splenda didn't help much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I ordered two boxes and will be lucky if I get through one. Guess I'll sell the other one on ebay or something. Dunno. What I *do* know is that I won't be drinking it."
"Cinnimon toothpics anyone?  Awsome!  Careful though, they are about as hot as you can imagine, you won't be able to feel your lips!"
"Wow - if you like coconut - you will love these - Extremely moist pure coconut with pieces of delicious mango!! These are not overly sweet - just a natural coconut and mango sweetness level. Great for take-a-long snacks!! We love them!!! Will order these again and again and again!!!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JVEKNM"">Oskri Coconut Bar with Mango, Gluten Free, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 20)</a>"
"After trying the 6 lb bag of Go Grain Free Endurance, and watching my Border Collie's skin allergy problem begin to disappear, this had to be one of the reasons its gone now. All I can say is this dog food is the best. I will never go back to standard-cheap-filled with whatever-dog food as I think my dog is worth the extra natural goodness in Go. End of story..."
I have had other matcha powders before and for its value I think you can't do any better than this. I have my matcha every morning and I love it..
"These taste soooooo good, kind of like a candy bar without all the calories. Nice in between meals snack, very satisfying, Be careful, they taste so good, it's hard to each just one! I totally recommend this product, AWESOME!"
"Was looking for a product not made in China, these are made in Ireland.  My dogs love them!  I buy two packages under the 15% discount, automatic delivery system, which is the best price I found."
"I was really impressed with these peppercorns and they make everything taste good. I eat alot of pasta, fish and shellfish dishes. I think it works best sprinkle on salmon, or shrimp. It gives them that extra kick without adding garlic. I highly recommend these 7 ounce pouches of black peppercorns. They are just perfect and grinds very well in my peppermill. And yes I will definitely purchase these again in the future."
"I usually purchase this item in smaller links (about 9 to a pound) and stash it in the freezer.  It is the perfect dinner in a hurry:  thaw in microwave, toss in grill pan to brown.  Meanwhile, make a salad of greens, and for a side, saute canned cannellini beans with herbs and garlic, whip up some instant polenta made creamy with goat cheese, or break open a crusty loaf of bread. 15 minutes to the table and you have the ultimate comfort food.  Leftover sausage gets diced into pasta sauce. Plenty of flavor; and while spice is present, people who usually shun hot or peppery food will like this."
I got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. I would like to no if there is an reimburse.
"This is a crunchy, wonderfully tasty bar! Coconut and almond flavors blend to create something wonderful! You won't be disappointed with these. They're on my shopping list for regularly delivery."
My dogs just love these crunchy and healthy treats.  We are very particular about what we feed our girls and are happy to have found such a good product that is a great value AND made locally!!
"I first heard of these beans on The Doctor Oz show.  They were unavailable at the local grocers.  I found them on Amazon and now send them as gifts to people I care about.  Saute onions, bell pepper, plenty garlic in olive oil or coconut oil.  Let them carmelize...then follow the package directions.  I added one pound of smoked sausage (Cajun Style) and let the beans cook for nearly two hours.  Serve over brown rice.  Good enough for a company meal. This is an Amazon verified purchase."
This tea is really good!  I am a big coffee drinker and normally do not like tea but the spices they use make it not have a tea aftertaste.  I can find this at a local grocery for considerably less than what it is priced for on here.
"I bought two dozen of these. They are so cute and were not expired as some of the other reviews mentioned. I think they might have been looking at the wrong date. There are two dates. One for when it was manufactured and one for when they expire. They expire in 2013. I think the bowling pins work better upside down and it doesn't take away from the cutness of these. They came in red and blue balls, and bowling pins. I have not tasted them but they look good. None were broken or melted and arrived very fast in a safely packaged box. I would recommend these. My only complaint was that out of two boxes I only got a total of four bowling pin suckers :( and the majority were red bowling balls. I would have liked third red third blue third bowling pins. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Keep up the great work you guys!"
"Silken style, extra firm Mori-Nu tofu is perfect for my chocolate truffle recipe and it is perfectly priced. I have used this product for some six years now, perfecting my recipe. Recently I experienced resistance of the vegetable grocers to carry the product so I went on line and found it  at Amazon.com. I now have the product delivered free directly to my door and I know it will always be available. This is important when one is  addicted to chocolate truffles.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ86K"">Mori-Nu Tofu, Silken Style, Extra Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>"
This Green Chai Tea is very good--how can it be healthy and seem like a treat at the same time?
"My boston terrier/english bulldog puppy's coat became shiny on this food, his breath smelled good, his gas wasn't stinky, and the food appears to have excellent ingredients.  However, after over a month of eating Wellness, his stool never became firm (which it was on whatever cheap food he was eating at the breeders). It alternated between runny and mushy. I'd read similar reviews on various websites, but decided to try it anyway (everyone's experiences are different). Although I have no way of knowing this, I wonder if some of the fancier dogfoods overdo it with the flax and greentea---it would certainly give me the runs.  Anyway, I think it's a good food and may work well for some dogs, but we've had to transition off of it to Merrick puppy plate, which, although it has similar ingredients, seems to be firming up the poop."
wonderfully cinnamon-y! i will definitely be ordering it again! and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste.
Nana's Chocolate and chocolate Chip cookies are very tasty. They have no dairy and have all natural sugar (fruit juice) and no trans fat. I like they way they each have their own package so they stay fresher longer.<br />These are the kind of cookies that make you feel like you are eating healthier.
"Great product, good concentration. However, this made me hate caffeine and now I have too much of this. Order a small package first and see how you handle it."
"These chips are delicious. If you like salt & pepper flavored chips with a solid crunch, then you can't go wrong with these--they are the tastiest bag I've come across. The sea salt is easier on the palette than regular salt, in fact I have trouble cutting myself off mid-bag even though I normally enjoy a low sodium diet. I would feel like less of a lush if they had them in the 8-9oz bags."
"I was extremely pleased when I recv'd these.  They were much larger and thicker than anticipated.  Professionally packaged.  For the money, I just don't see why you would want to order any other.  Best bang for the buck.<br /><br />Can't give you product feedback, as these are being given as a Christmas gift with a nice set of Weber stainless steel grilling utensils (hint hint....what a great gift combo for the grill master in your family)."
"I enjoy these tremendously--they are a reasonably healthy snack compared with most.  How can you go wrong with a veggie? Remember your mother's admonition to eat your peas :)  They are truly very tasty, in spite of being peas..."
"Spaghetti was a favorite meal before needing to eat gluten free, so we have tried many gf spaghettis trying to find a good substitute, including the popular brand that begins with a T. The ""T"" brand was my favorite, although it was only passable, until I tried the Ener-g Rice Vermicelli. The Ener-g Vermicelli was the first gf pasta to make eating spaghetti really enjoyable again! It is now my favorite gf spaghetti as it lacks the overwhelmingly rice flavor and stickiness of many rice spaghettis. It is good enough that we even use it for meals like Shrimp Scampi with angel hair pasta, and Linguine with white clam sauce, and the meals are delicious."
"I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.  If they would just use plain old sugar, I'd be much happier with this product."
This is my favorite brand for cooking. I wish that it came in bigger bottles but other than that that it's comparable to what you get at a brick and mortar store.
Received product on time as promised in excellent condition.  Product is a delight to use in my gourmet dishes; adds a whole new level of flavor.
"I purchased this plant after spending a small fortune hoping it would be all I hoped and read about in the description. Within the first week of purchase the plant shed all it's leaves and seems to be dead or dormant. It arrived with full beautiful leaves and a few flowers, I had high hopes. I followed the instructions to the tee and within no time it lost everything. I took it to a friend who is a professional with bonsai plants and he thinks it was sent as a dying tree meaning it comes looking great but it is really dying. I'm so angry that I spent so much and have had nothing but problems. I do have a green thumb and can usually resurrect anything but this may be a lost cause. I've tried to prune back the dead and fertilize and hope it will pull through but have a feeling I wasted $50.00. Don't waste your time hopes or money on this item. Buy local so you have support and hopefully a guarantee."
"Very light slightly sweet crunchy biscuit bread. Tastes great just with butter but you can put anything on it. It's so light that it's also great for upset stomachs etc. I eat it for breakfast every morning. I like ""Brandt"" the best."
"PLEASE BE ADVISED, this coffee is NOT decaffeinated.  I used it and got violently ill b/c I am sensitive to caffeine.  Any where else it would be considered false advertising.  I am very disappointed with Amazon in having such shoddy oversight over how and what is advertised on their site.  To add insult to injury, the coffee is horrible."
"If you like a Mild Hazelnut coffee at a reasonable price, then this one is for you. I'd like it a little bolder, but that's my fault for not ordering a bolder style."
"This coffee was purchased in the past before for my husband.  Due to circumstances beyond my control I no longer needed it.  I had cancelled many automatic shipments in the past - hoping that I would be able to start them up again in the future, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Eventually I cancelled the entire Sumatra account.  I never actually took possession of the coffee for it was being held at the post office for signature - not sure why.  When I went to the post office they showed me the box and I asked them to return it.  Please contact me about the refund to my account at your earliest convenience.  TYVM."
"I grew up in Seattle, and drinking Market Spice Tea was one of the treats I enjoyed every time I went to Pike Place Market.  My family has been ordering their tea for years, and we drink it all the time.  Now we even carry it in our own retail store in Portland! I'm not much of a tea drinker other than Market Spice, but it tastes so good that I can't resist."
"Thanks Amazon for offering this item on autoship.  We use it in our coffee every morning.  Delicious!!!!!!!<br />Because it is sugar-free, I feel no guilt.  Also we add whipped cream to make the coffee taste like starbucks.  Yummy......."
"I love these candied orange peels.  I purchase them every holiday season to enjoy plain, in baked goods, in tea, and my favorite way, dipped in dark chocolate.  Oh, so good!"
"A truly tasty medium heat paste that is delicious on a wide variety on food.  From mixing with yogurt for a dipping sauce to serving on eggs, mixed in with vegetables, or spread on sliced beef, this is excellent!  It has a slightly grainy texture from the ground spices, and has just the right amount of salt and garlic.<br /><br />Delicious!  I ordered four more!"
"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way."
We like Plockys<br />They like us.<br />Plockys Plockys.<br />Mean no fuss.<br />Taste so good.<br />And healthy too.<br />Plockys Plockys.<br />Grab a bag or two.<br />Thank you Plockys!!
"Absolutely love this stuff..so happy Amazon has it available. I not only use it for spaghetti, but other pasta dishes, pizza, and anything else Italian  :)"
"This Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is soooo convenient to have them in your purse, in your kids lunch bag and in your husbands lunch bag. They are healthy snacks for kids and adults I will keep buy it them for my family"
"We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he's never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.<br /><br />I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I'm looking for a 3rd high-quality brand to add to the rotation."
"These grits are excellent.  Amazon, in their product description says that ""hominy grits are coarsely ground hominy or corn"".  That statement is incorrect.  Hominy IS corn...that has the germ removed and is soaked in a weak lye solution.<br />Grits made from hominy are superior to grits made from regular cracked corn.  If you like grits, you will love this product from Angelina's Gourmet.  One item missing from Amazon and Angelina is cooking instructions.  Bring 1 1/4 cups of water to a low boil.  Add 1/3 cups of grits. Turn heat to its lowest setting.  You want the grits to barely simmer, not boil!  Stir well and frequently for the first couple of minutes.  Cover pan , removing to stir every couple of minutes.  About 15 minutes will do it.  The longer you can cook without going dry, the creamier the grits will be. Serving size?  It's one serving for me, maybe two for you.  You can figure this out......not rocket science."
"I have problems finding this flavor in the stores, so it's fantastic to find them on Amazon and I can buy many boxes at once in a bulk-type format.  Thanks for making them available!"
They are salty (but not too much so) and crunchy and have a sufficient amount of nutrition. I don't waste them on salads--just eat them right out of the bag. They shipped quickly and had a good expiration date from Amazon.
"I can't give these a 5 because the ingredients show they are very processed.  I'm not sure how healthy they are.<br /><br />But the taste is great - very hot  - like about a nuclear on the Zaxby's scale.  If you like hot wings, you'll like these.  Be prepared to not be able to leave them alone.  When my husband buys a bag, we sit there and eat them until they are gone.  Also, have something to drink handy!"
I am enjoying my Senseo even more with the addition of the new varities. I like the Sumatra Blend as well as the Brazil.
One of the better k-cup coffee out there.  Most k-cup coffee I've tried are pretty weak but this one is definitely a keeper.
"My dogs like this treat pretty well.  They are a little on the dry side, but I have bought other treats that were also dry and they seem to like these better.  I would buy them again."
"I buy these at Walmart, same brand, 24 ounces for $10.89.  To see 16 ounces at $20 was a shock to me.  Thought I might find them cheaper on amazon but on this one, it was just the opposite.  Great product, would buy them here if the pricing was more fair."
I received one of these in a sampler package I had ordered of different flavored coffees from the Official Keurig.com website. I just didn't like the taste of it. I would not order this K-Cup again.
This item was ordered for my son for Valentines Day; not only did it ship super fast - but it came with a little finger puppet toy for free. The item was flawless and packed very well. I definitely will be buying from this seller again!
"Stephen's is absolutely the BEST hot chocolate I have ever tasted!  It is so creamy and delicious.  Every flavor I've ever tried is excellent.  My whole family loves it.  I don't know any stores in the area that sell it, so we are thrilled to be able to order it through Amazon."
"The donut shop blend is a nice flavored coffee, and is not too pricey. We use our single cup Bunn machine a lot, and the single serve coffee here is nice.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q06JD2"">My CafÃ?Â©(tm) Pourover Commercial Grade Tea & Coffee Pod Brewer, Black (BUNMCP)</a>"
What can I say.....or rather what would my dog say.  She loves these CET Dog Chews; she expects them every day as a part of her daily routine.  My lab has been using this product for 9 years.
"I bought these cookies at Cost Plus World Market when they were running a promotion.  The picture on the box is larger than life: these treats are only about an inch tall.  The stem is a light and crispy little biscuit barbell that reminds me of classic Pocky.  The cap is made of some cheap waxy chocolate, on par with a Hershey's kiss -- note that the packaging never claims this is actual chocolate, just ""chocolaty,"" so it probably doesn't have the requisite amount of cocoa butter to call itself real chocolate.  The flavor doesn't have much depth or complexity, it's just sweet.  All the appeal is in the shape.  They're just so darn cute!  They make me want to decorate a cake to look like a forest glade and stick these mushrooms in it, and I'm not even into cake decorating."
It was fragrant. My house smelled like basmati rice for hours.The cooked grains don't have that fragrant smell though. This cooked really quickly - a lot quicker than expected.<br />I'm happy with my purchase.
"Love these k-cups, bold flavor similar to Jet Fuel or Big Easy with less of a French roast flavor.  I can actually get a 12 Oz. cup and still have good flavor."
Product was delivered with none broken. Quality item with a consistent taste. Only thing is these are cheaper to by directly from Lotus Bakery than Amazon and this particular size is not the jumbo size given out on the airline. Next time will by them directly from Lotus Bakery - they have greater variety and are a little cheaper.
"I got this tea Monday and I made some right before I went to sleep.I usually drink sleepytime extra but this tea actually helped me sleep better more soundly and I do have sleep problems but I rested peacefully after drinking this.I love teavana teas they are great!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LUYN7Y"">Teavana Tranquil Dream Herbal Tea, 2oz</a>"
"The Aji Panca peppers were the ingredient for Hot Sauce.  I blended 10 Aji Pankas and two Bhut Jolokias plus Heinz Cider Vinegsr for a great outcome.

I really like my Tassimo and I love this tea!  I make it all the time.  I do wish there were more tea offerings though.
"I moved to north Mississippi 6 years ago and rarely get bet back to Texas.  However, I make sure that I load up on Tex Joy Steak Seasoning every trip.  This is the best all around seasoning in the world.  Great on everything, not just steaks!  Give it a try and you will agree with me."
"I've tried many different brands and types of coffee K-Cups, but this one is my most favorite, hands down.  Great flavor, strong but not too strong, low acidity and the aroma is just amazing.  For me, this is THE BEST K-Cup on the market.  I drink it in the morning, and afternoon and just love it."
"I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey, and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead brewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this, I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark, rich honey without the ""hay taste"" of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all, having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff, and kept going back for more.  I have my mead brewing (6 1/2 gallons), and the brewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead, which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!"
"I have a one year old, and after trying this, he's addicted to the stuff. I tried it myself and it's not bad!<br /><br />I love that it's fairly nutritious and natural and it's also nice that kiddo can suck the stuff out of the package (with a little help from Dad), so you don't even need to carry around a spoon and bib like with messier jars/tubs of baby food.<br /><br />We'll be buying more."
Good tasting Italian dressing - I would say one of the best I've had.  The fact that there are zero calories or carbs is great.  It is almost impossible to find salad dressings with no calories.  Convenient packets that don't need refrigeration.  I keep one in my purse always!
the most flavorless dark chocolate I have ever tasted. flat taste melts crumbly in your mouth.I prefer a rich powerful chocolate with a smooth texture.
This was a no nonsense purchase.  My purchase quickly in good condition.  I found it to much cheaper than a retail store along with the convenience.
"If you are sick of the overly-sweet taste of regular or diet sodas, this is the product for you.<br /><br />As a sparkling juice drink, Izze offers the best of both worlds -- there's fruit juice for health and fizz for fun. The taste is excellent, and the packaging size is just enough to refresh you.<br /><br />Of course, you can always mix any fruit juice with seltzer at home for a healthy spritzer, but Izze can't be beat for refreshment on the go! It's a great item to take along with you to work or school, and will save you from the feast of chemicals usually available from vending machines or fast fast food places.<br /><br />The clementine flavor has the wonderful sweet/tart taste of a fizzy fresh fruit! The pomegranite is a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon and pomegranite and packs quite a tart and sweet punch!"
Love! Love! Love! This coffee is the best! I love getting it right to my house! It is the only coffee I can drink... Absolutely wonderful!
"Love this stuff, but have learned the hard way that this is one of those tricky, well-disguised sources of gluten (verified via [..] after suspicious encounter).<br /><br />I would give five stars if judging solely on taste and overall value, but they lose one for containing unnecessary gluten, and another for not openly disclosing it on the package or website."
"I used this hop in my 4th off july ale as a 'finishing hop , not the bittering hop.I must say that it is nice , aromatic and fresh . It has a hint of woody smell that is notable. I would use this hop again in the future. jon cook"
I love to cook Chinese food; and a particular favorite dish is chicken or shrimp with hoisin sauce.  Koon Chun is difficult to find in local stores; but it is far and away the best hoisin -- both in terms of flavor and consistency.
"This is a very good spice. I found it at our local grocery store and liked it right away. My husband likes it VERY much. He tries it on everything. We use it for fajitas, fried potatos, hot sauce, spicy fried chicken, Fried mushrooms, shrimp, taco meat, beans, potato cheese soup.... We have tried it on alot of things. My favorite is on chicken though, If you put it on chicken and then grill it It is awsome. Great for chicken fajitas or just with rice. I was really glad to find it here on amazon they quit carrying it at our grocery store. They flavor is spicy with a hint of sweetness. If you use too much it can be very hot. Great for adding a spicy taste to almost anything."
"I took a chance on these Yummy Earth candies and am pleased to say that they really are good.  Most flavors were liked by the children although the mango tango was a bit too tangy for some.  As usual, you get what you pay for and I hope more people try them so that the factory can produce more and hopefully bring the price down.  Overall a good product that you won't feel guilty giving your children or eating yourself."
"If they were not on sale, I wouldn't have bought them, having tried other brands of ""guac-a-mole"" flavored tortilla chips.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price.  The taste is hard to describe - somewhere between gasoline and garbage, neither of which I've ever actually ingested, but which these chips brought to mind by taste and smell.  How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) ""new look, same great taste"" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the ""Mad-Men"" era I grew up in."
"Rich taste, strong coffee. Not for 1/2-caf drinkers or weak of heart. :) Definately busts through my morning fog! Store in the freezer and grind as needed to keep rich flavor."
"This ZERO calorie rice substitute is the answer to every no-carb dieters prayer. The liquid they are packed in has a distinct fermented odour and they recommend rinsing them well. This doesn't really get rid of the smell but, after some experimentation, I found that drizzling vinegar over them and letting them sit for a minute, then rinsing again, removes all trace. After they are rinsed, fry them with a bit of cooking spray to dry them, this gives a better texture, then add your favorite sauce or just stirfry veggies, noodles and soy for an almost no-cal snack anytime. They do have more of a gel texture than a grain texture but hey! for zero calories, it's a great meal stretcher or afternoon snack for dieters."
"This is a great product with a fresh taste.  I am a school teacher and I use this powder every morning and it gets me all the way to lunch without feeling hungry.  I mix it with a banana, half cup blueberries, strawberries, yogurt, and 4 ounces of juice.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a good way to add a large amount of fiber to your diet in an easy way.  The grittiness wasn't at all hard for me to get used to and I am a very picky eater so I figure if it's good for me, it will be good for most.  If you are watching your calorie intake, I recommend using half the designated serving size, I was a little surprised at the amount of calories in it, especially since I add all kinds of stuff to it.<br />Wonderful product!"
If you're getting this for cleaning your teeth then it's pretty good. But I'd recommend a different flavor. This doesn't last longer than three minutes. But it does clean teeth in between brushing pretty well.
"I ordered what is pictured, seeing the word ""Sockeye"" written on the can:  ""Red Salmon Traditional Style Sockeye Packed Fresh in Alaska"" but what I actually received were 12 Chicken of the Sea cans that say, ""Red Salmon Traditional Style All Natural Packed Fresh in Alaska."" Inside the can, the meat was definitely more red than canned pink salmon or canned chum salmon (keta salmon) but perhaps slightly less red than genuine sockeye salmon. Since king salmon (chinook salmon) is highest in fat and too valuable to sell as canned salmon, it means that Chicken of the Sea might be selling the less valuable, less tasty, coho salmon (silver salmon) as ""red"" salmon and deliberately trying to deceive as many people as possible that they purchased the more valuable, tastier, sockeye salmon. Coho salmon (silver salmon) is slightly redder, slightly higher in fat, and slightly more valuable than pink salmon or chum salmon (keta salmon) but less red, lower in fat, and less valuable than genuine sockeye salmon.<br />  The encyclopedia says that coho salmon can also be called, ""red salmon"" or ""silver salmon.""  Sockeye salmon can also be called, ""red salmon.""  Chum salmon can also be called, ""silverbrite salmon"" or ""keta salmon.""  The 12 cans that I received say, ""INGREDIENTS: RED SALMON, SALT."" They make no mention of ""sockeye"" or ""coho"" or ""silver"" anywhere on the can. These cans do say, ""Wild Caught.""<br />  My final conclusion: I believe that I probably did receive genuine, wild-caught, Alaskan sockeye salmon in my 12 cans because the meat is red enough and the taste is good enough.  But the next time I order, what will I get?"
"Absolutely, without a doubt, the BEST dressing I've ever eaten! The salad is just the vessel to get this dressing into my mouth. I think I could drink it right out of the bottle....who needs a salad?"
"This is an all-around great movie from the 90's.  If you like comedy/horror, this is for you.  Alec Baldwin is great, and Michael Keaton is AWESOME as Beetlejuice.  Classic movie especially in Blu-Ray."
This cereal blows away anything you can buy is the local supermarket. It tastes great and is not to sweet. Tastes good hot or cold. It has no artificial ingredients in it and is full of nuts and fruit. Highly recommend it.
"The title says it all! These butter biscuits are DIVINE! Everyone loves them--my parents, my students, my colleagues, and, of course, me! You will love them, too!"
"I love this sesame cereal.. I have tried several brands and none is as good as this one. It's so nutritious and not too sweet. And all the ingredients are organic!! I just love it. But there are only 4 packs in a box, so it's eaten up pretty fast.. I wish there could be a bigger box.."
"I ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for Christmas.  He loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own.  Delivery was good, I had it in several days but still in plenty of time for Christmas.  Would recommend to anyone."
"I have four cats, and trying to get them all to eat the same food was a real chore.  They were on the Wellness Core kitten/cat formula, but my older two were not gaining the weight that they needed to for some reason.  So I decided to switch their food after over a year.  I really agonized over the change since I do have one cat that is a VERY picky eater.  I can't even begin to describe how delighted I was when I put this in their bowl and she was the first one to run over and start to gobble it up.  They have been eating it for a couple of months now, and the two older cats have started to gain their weight back.  I am a happy owner and my cats are happy fuzzballs.  :)"
"These are in fact manufactured by 5 hour energy and are just a rebrand of their original product.  The flavors are the same (I dislike the grape, wish they'd leave it out), the effect is the same unless you're used to the ""extra strength"" version."
This product was delivered in a timely manner.  My whole family enjoy this product - both taste and texture are very good.  The only reason I have not given the hot dog buns 5 stars is that one pack has gone mouldy - several months prior to the exparation date and within a sealed pack!  A review of packaging perhaps?
"We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need. Well, you'd never know it! They seem to always be hungry, day or night. What goes? I don't want to feed them again and get them to looking like Garfield. So, I got these Whiskas Temptations cat treats and I give them a few every now and them. Boy, do they go fast. The treats barely hit the dish and they're gone! Well, I notice they're only 2 calories per treat so they can't be doing much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"Hemp protein is a low glycemic alternative to whey and soy.  These bars lack nothing in the taste department, and are a good snack or meal replacement."
You cannot find this dressing in stores around Michigan... for some dumb reason. I just love that I can buy it in BULK now. Thank GOD for amazon. This dressing is the most flavorful and tasty of all the good seasons dressings I have had! I dunno what I would do without it!!!
"Absolutely LOVE these cookies!!!  Perfectly soft, delish taste - just GREAT!  Kids love them too, just ordered MORE for treats here and there at home and for school ""treat"" time, when all the kids are eating something my son can't have - he is not missing anything when he has these! :o)"
"These bees are very cute! I used them to put on our ""beehive"" cupcakes for my son's 1st bday party. They looked great!"
"We have tried a variety of granola, power bars and others - and this is the best that we have found - good source of energy, all natural, tastes great (we have tried all the flavors and the original is our favorite - followed by chocolate cherry)  And the other good thing is that they don't have all the sodium and sugar that most other bars will weigh you down with.  Great for a snack and the gym or at work."
"We began feeding natural foods after 2 of our cats developed ""asthma"". The veterinarians treated them with prednisone and the cats became sicker and sicker.  We switched to natural foods and the asthma completely disappeared, never to return.  So, we fed natural foods for years, then picked up a few strays that refused to eat them and we went a while feeding low quality grocery store brands to those cats just so we didn't end up throwing away a lot of natural food.  Then we tried this and every one of our 6 cats are totally thrilled with it and lick their bowls clean.  We are not throwing any food away and feel great about feeding a high-quality food once again to our cats.  We have also had great luck with Evangers pheasant and Wellness Core.  The natural pet food companies seem to be working hard to make their foods tastier.  If you have tried natural foods before and have been disappointed with their palatability, you should definitely give this a try."
"It is hard to get Assam tea in the store, let alone organic Assam.<br />I was pleased at how fast this one arrived and how nicely it is<br />packaged."
"I was very pleasantly surprised! Not too oily, with plenty of bergamot flavor, I drink this tea every morning. If you drink other earl grey's, you know that some will leave an oily residue around the rim. Not so with this tea. Its not bitter either like some. Over all I was quite pleased. It does come packaged loose in a cardboard box, so if you have a place for such things that's good,"
At first I thought I liked it but then I got a funny taste to it. I only had one to try so maybe the second time around it would have been better. I do love the kona blend by Tully. Yum!
"I have read many reviews on this subject and was having the same problem  Coffee backs up, grouunds in coffee, stops short.  It appears the problem is the way the coffee settles into the pod and obstructs the flow of water through it.  I have found that if I give a gentle shake to the pod, to lossen the coffee inside, it eliminates the problem. Maybe I am just lucky, but I had maybe 20-30 bad pods over six months time. After I started shaking the pods to make sure the coffee was loose and not packed, no more problems. I enjoy this brand very much and should give it five stars."
"I tried this soup because I am on a very strict diet that does not allow me to eat any food containing gluten, corn, or potatoes. It is very hard to find things that I can have because even most soups contain some kind of starch or flour made from corn, wheat, etc.<br /><br />Other split pea soups I have tried have too much of one flavor, but this one has a perfect blend of vegetables and spices. It has a very thick consistency so you get more of the actual soup instead of mostly water.<br /><br />The ingredients in this split pea soup are:<br /><br />Water, Organic Split Peas, Organic Carrots, Organic Onions, Organic Celery, Organic Peas, Organic Rice Flour, Sea Salt, Organic Spices.<br /><br />It is a good source of protein, Vitamin A, and a VERY good source of fiber. Another good thing is that it's fat free.<br /><br />I am so glad I found this soup because it is healthy, filling, and tastes wonderful. It tastes so good that I would buy it even if I were not on a special diet."
This orange oil is absolutely wonderful for flavoring baked goods. A little goes a long way and the bottle lasts a long time with no loss of flavor.
"The process of pushing water with a certain amount of pressure through these pods, produces a flavorful, frothy cup of coffee. If however you use one pod for each four ounces, you are not having an inexpensive experience. If however you supplement your brew with instant coffee and brew eight ounces of coffee from each pod, you can get the same frothy effect and have more control over how strong your want your coffee.<br /><br />I even know somebody who uses each pod twice (sixteen ounces of coffee from each pod). There is not as much froth on the second round but the coffee is still serviceable."
"This is consistently one of my favorite cups of coffee for my Keurig. Not too bold, not too light, just a good regular cup of coffee that this regular guy likes."
"I love these bottles & have used them with all of my children. I want so badly to give them 5 stars!!! I just had my 3rd baby, whom I breastfeed, but need the bottle as I returned to college today. He takes these bottles great & still nurses well too. But there is a HUGE problem with them.<br /><br />The measurements on the sides are about 1.5 oz off! This is a huge deal. When I put 2 oz of breastmilk in the bottle is only reaches the 1 oz mark.<br /><br />Can't believe this has been a problem for so long and Evenflo hasn't done anything to fix it. Now I am wondering if the bottles I used with my other two children were labeled correctly!"
We liked the reviews and realized the wisdom of organic coffee...so tried it.<br />We love it! Very smooth and flavorful.
Grove Square Cappuccino Cups were excellent. Tasted really good right from the Keurig brewer with nothing added.  wWould highly recommend.  RCCJR
This gum is wonderful.  I was very excited to find it in the larger package.
"These (in all their flavors) have been a real hit in our home.  We don't eat them all the time, but they are great when you are craving something sweet.  Everyone from dad down to the kids love them.  No artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup."
"I was so excited to get these, but the taste was nothing like I remembered!  The cookies tasted burnt, and the color was a lot darker than pictured.  When I contacted the company, they blamed it on the packaging, saying they hear this complaint a lot with the family pack.  The person I talked to said I'd have more luck with the individually wrapped ones, so she sent me a free box of those.  I'm not quite sure how the recipe/cooking process would be different based on how the cookie is packaged--makes no sense to me!--but the company did redeem themselves by offering a new pack.  And they do indeed taste a little better."
"This Coconut Oil product is nothing short of amazing! It makes a delicious body moisturizer, a flavour enhancer over breakfast cerea or in hot chocolate for a ""coconutty"" flavour. Highly recommended."
"I use to buy a lot of this jerquee from Amazon, but for the past two months or more every shipment has been bad.<br />The stuff has been covered in toxic mold, and I had to throw it away and get my money back.<br /><br />I will be ordering it direct from the factory from now on.<br />I have read here others have had the same problem buying it via Amazon.<br /><br />Other than that, is is the best tasting jerquee out there."
"Tony the cat loves this stuff.  I open it with scissors (after too many squirting episodes) and scoop out the junk with a spoon.  Gotta get every last drop, this stuffs expensive!  Chicken's bettern' the fish."
"I am a tea drinker- never coffee. I am always looking for new teas to try and prefer black teas. I drink this Rize tea black and without milk or sugar. It is ground very fine and brews up quickly. It does not however get bitter, as many fine ground teas do.<br />It has a great aroma, full, almost smokey, flavor and a decent caffeine kick. My lady, who is a dedicated (to say the least) coffee drinker, loves the smell and flavor of this Rize tea enough that she bought herself a bag from Amazon.<br />This is a good tea, quite different from the Indian, Chinese, Ceylon etc. I usually get. It has become a regular in my tea ""rotation""."
"The active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid.  It is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves, but not the flowers I learned recently online.  I have been using this stuff for years and obseved this, but put it down to my not giving the plant enough granules.  Unless you SPRAY the flowers with another product containing the insecticide, the Japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone.<br /> see link<br />[...]"
The Newman's Own Organics 2nd Generation Turkey & Vegetable has changed the ingredients from Turkey Liver to Pultry Liver.<br />This is not good if your cat is allergic to Chicken as ours is.<br />The Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable original is no longer available.
This is my favorite K-cup coffee.  It is very bold and work on any cup size.  We use about 3 K-cups each day so the 80 pack lasts for quite a while.
Of all of the different variety packs they sell....this one is by far the best!. The chewy pomegranate is delicious and compliment the cashews incredibly!
"I am stuck with 36 of these K cups.San Francisco French Roast Decaf.  This french roast is expecially frenchy, very bitter!!!So what do I do with the other 34 cups?  One I gave to my daughter who loves french roast.  Does NOT want them.  Help!"
"It's sweet, it's smooth and it tastes divine.<br /><br />What makes it so nice is that it is definitely not like typical store honey because it doesn't have that plain runny sticky honey flavor but at the same time it's not earthy, musty, or herbal like some of the other types.  It's just nicely sweet with a great deep texture.<br /><br />Put in the fridge... magic."
"My three dogs are very picky about their food and especially about their treats. They LOVE these Best Bite treats. They are hard to find in most pet stores, especially in large bags. The large bag saves me money and being freeze dried helps them last a lot longer."
"Finally, Senseo has pods with a full, and rich flavor. These new coffees from around the world take the possibilities to a new level. My favorite thing is to try combinations of various pods. The best so far to my taste is a Columbia paired with this Sumatra.<br /><br />Hope they keep expanding the line!"
"My superdwarf banana plants arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Each plant had about a six leaves on it with minimal shipping damage. I re-potted them immediately and they suffered no transplant shock.  They're now thriving in a sunny window.<br /><br />Another word on re-pottng.  The plants are packed and potted for shipping in shallow, light-soiled, 4"" containers, which means that you'll want to re-pot them into a bigger pot immediately.  I can't stress that enough. I honestly wouldn't wait more than a day to re-pot, as in the warmer months the plant could dry out very quickly."
"My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?"
"These have better ingredients than regular Milk Bones, even though the first ingredient is wheat flour.  They do have some glucosamine which is good.  The dog likes them.  These are for medium/large dogs but they are actually quite small compared to the regular large Milk Bones."
It has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness.<br /><br />How strong is it? I would say it is similar in strength to auto-drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water.
"It was much better than I thought it would be for the price, a true value in chocolate. Outstanding shipping as well. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered more for holiday gifts ..."
"This is the best salad EVER....I first purchased it at the Global Gourmet in Lake Geneva and I can't live without it.  When I wanted to purchase another jar, they didn't have it in stock and I was promised it would arrive soon.....well, when soon turned into over 7 months, I searched Amazon & was thrilled to see it there....and EVEN BETTER.....it was almost half of the price I paid at Global Gourmet.  My friends all love it too and I purchase it as a surprise to give to them."
"I've looked for this in other places, until I ordered it online.  Quite relaxing (it works for me, which is not easy) and tastes good.  I really enjoy having a cup of tea before going to bed.  I wake up next morning rested and fresh.  In times when stress levels up, it's good to have a natural way to control it, instead of taking pills."
"My one year old pit mix is incredibly food motivated and can clean out any kong, no matter how tightly stuffed, in 10 minutes. I got this toy to keep her busy, and while it does take her a long time to clean it out, the toy is simply too loud. Roxy likes to kick this toy across the floor, sending it flying into the wall or the table. The hard plastic of the toy scrapes across the hard wood floor and then makes a loud ""bang"" as it slams into things. Not only is the noise really annoying, but I am also worried she might break something because the bottle is very hard."
I got these for work.  Sometimes the coffee pot is turned off and I just have hot water to make a cup of coffee.  This coffee does not taste very good or strong.  Maybe if you like weak coffee it would be OK but for me it is marginal at best.
"This coffee literally stinks! Opened the bag, dripping with oils and I almost got sick from the smell. It is so strong in flavor you cannot make it drinkable. I find it bitter unless you add a ton of milk and sugar (not good). I do not understand all these good reviews (thats why I chose it)because it is hands down the worst coffee I have ever had!"
I use Zipfizz before and during workouts to give me a jump start when I really don't want to exercise.  It also gives me an energy kick during long road bike rides.
"***<br />This Decaffeinated Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />On the plus side, it is naturally decaffeinated, which I appreciate. Also, it seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Decaf Earl Grey.<br />***"
"I first tried a small bag of the Barbeque Popchips on a business trip in California.  They were so good I bought several extra bags and brought them home with me for my kids to try (9 and 10 year olds).  They liked them so much, I ordered a 24 pack online so they could have one in their lunch each day.  My kids shared these chips with their friends at lunch and told me that everyone loved them!  All their friends wanted to know where we got them from!"
I have a miniature schnauzer who is allergic to chicken.  For a treat this is safe for her to eat without her having any problems.  I will continue to buy them.
Almost every morningI prepare a potfull of coffee. On the days when I just want a cup or two I use the Senseo. I'm not much for the coffee so thick that it can hold up a spoon. Senseo Breakfast Blend is just right. I enjoy the bonus creme it leaves after it steams a fresh cup. The little pod can be reused in the garden so zero footprint. What can you do with those little plastic cups from the other brand?
"Dieting since mid-May using whole grains in pastas, rice, etc, and this orzo in whole wheat is just not able to be found anywhere but here--so happy to find it. (Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w/butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore."
"My puppy loves these!  They're small, moist and tasty - perfect for training and rewarding good behavior.  The chicken and peanut butter flavors are great too.  Good stuff!"
"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!"
"my puppy loves this treat.  we actually quarter them and a bag this size lasts a very long time. for us, it's a perfect training treat.<br />some dogs like them, some don't- but when the stores in the area are selling this at more than double the price AND our dog is nutty for them... it's a no brainer."
"A couple years ago my dentists told me that tap water was rotting my teeth.  So it was time to make change.  Usually I just drink from the filter I attached to my kitchen faucet since bottled water is not good for the environment and sometimes bottled water manufacturers have been found to just put tap water in their bottles.  Essentia hypes ""silky smooth taste"" ""hydrates better"" ""electrolytes infused"" and ""Best available pH at 9.5"".  Okay, the last two sound like marketing mumbo jumbo.  It does have silky smooth taste, but really all water I have drank aside from unfiltered well or city water has silky smooth taste.  It does have a slight weird taste to it.  Not bad weird or good weird, just different taste to what I am used to.  As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.  Essentia will not get me to change from tap water, but if you only drink bottled water you may want to give it a try, it is a bigger bottle which makes it slightly better for the environment than the smaller bottles (but not s good as just buying a filter)."
I just love my Laffy Taffy and in all flavors but strawberrys just keeps my mouth watering for more...can't wait till I order cherry next time..
This Nut Chocolate Spread is just the right thing to start a day. Great brain food and perfect before a  workout.
"My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order."
"I have been using this brand of Ginseng/royal jelly for several months, both when I need an energy boost and in my morning smoothies.<br />It has a pleasant flavor, compared to pure Ginseng, and I love the way it perks me up without caffeine.<br />The price on Amazon is lower than anywhere I have found and I get it quickly."
"This food color is the best I've used so far and the price is great, much cheaper than spending a fortune on 1oz. bottles in the grocery store. It works great in red velvet cupcakes!"
"I haven't had any issues with the spoons or cups being too fragile -- I've run everything through the dishwasher and used them multiple times with no problems.  Combine this with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R7O190"">Egg Topper Cutter Clipper Stainless Kitchen Gadget</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M2BN0"">Nordic Ware 64802 Microwave Egg Cooker</a> and you'll have perfect soft-boiled eggs.  Use the little egg spoon to scoop the bit of egg out of the top that you cut with the cutter and then enjoy your egg in an egg cup.  So civilized and easy to eat!"
"island soyaki has a great flavor. sweet and alittle vinegary(i don't usually like this). my husband and i both like the seseame seeds. used it to flavor a chicken, mixed veggie and rice plate that i make. a must try, we will be ordering more soon. my inlaws and mom loved it too! even 3yr old grandson likes it..."
"A great tasty & healthy product, my entire family eats this product as snacks with dips or butter."
"When looking for this product online (since I couldn't find it in ANY stores) I was concerned because the picture of the product did not match the product name.  After doing much research I found out the UPC number & used it to determine if this was indeed the product I was looking for.  Once confirmed, I ordered it & kept my fingers crossed that it was what I was looking for.... it was!! I was delighted because I absolutely love the Kraft SWEET Balsamic Vinaigrette on my spinach/strawberry salad.  NOTE ~ I spoke with an Amazon representative & he could not verify that this was indeed what I was looking for... thus the reason for the research I had to perform.<br /><br />But, I am happy to report after all this I am happy to have my favorite dressing so that I can enjoy my favorite salad!"
My son loves the taste so much and wants to eat every meal I want to give it six stars
"I bought these Arizona Green Tea packets because I wanted an easy way to get in my glasses of water everyday.  These packets make it easy, all right, and it tastes great!  Personally, I use more water than it says to in each drink, because it's a little sweet.  I'm really glad I tried these out!"
"These oreo's were great, my family gobbled them up without conscience, i even had to hide some packs around the house so they would not over eat them hahaha. All i can say about these is Excellent i would reccommend these to every one. We even got a few people hooked as you dont see these in your every day supermarket in Denmark. Just great taste, fresh and delicious.<br />Yours Natasha (DENMARK)"
"I read some of the bad reviews for this product and was concerned, however, I ordered it anyway.....I am so glad I did.  This snack is delicious.  I'll agree with some viewers that it gets sticky in your mouth and gums up your teeth.....but it's temporary and your mouth clears out quickly so it's no big deal...at least not for me.  I bought this also because my grandson is highly allergic to most foods on the market unless they are fresh fruits and vegetables so this gives him a little variety.  They are easily packed away in his diaper bag for snacks during the day.  I do wish it wasn't as expensive as it is.....but....seems everything that is exceptional in life cost too much."
"I've been buying bonito flakes for my two cats as a treat.  I must say that they are so funny, they love this product so much they both come running and can hardly wait for me to open the bag. This is a super treat for spoiled cats!"
"If you like Chai, this will be your new favorite!  So yummy!  Our only problem was that we kept running out!"
"When I was growing up my German-French mother would tell me stories about how, when she was a little girl and suffered all winter from bronchitis, her French grandmother would take cherry stems, boil them all day long, and make a syrup out of them.  She would give this to my mother and it helped her bronchitis.<br /><br />Over the years I have heard how awesome cherry juice is for many things.  Since I am allergic to almost all medications, I have to find holistic ways to stay healthy.<br /><br />The tart cherry juice helps not only with arthritis but other things too.  My body feels so much better when I use it every day."
Just received and have incorporated this ground seed into my latest batch of mustard sauce.  I can tell by the aroma that this will be a great batch!
"I ordered the table top, the baking and the brown sugar.  There was a problem with the shipment.  I received 1 table top, and two baking--no brown sugar.  Upon contacting them, Customer Service of the Vendor reacted immediately; they sent me the brown sugar and a pre-paid envelope with which to return the extra baking product.  I cannot comment on the product--haven't used it yet; but I can definitely vouch for the fact that this company is responsive.<br /><br />I thought the price was a bit high and a 9 dollar shipping charge was excessive for A three pound shipment--but, Hey, the proof is in the pudding.  I don't mind the price if it is as good as it claims to be (I tasted a bit of the brown sugar when it arrived and it certainly had the flavor).  I am going to use this product extensively and then I will comment on its quality."
"I think the CET Hex rectangular strips probably clean my dogs teeth better, because they are thicker.  My dog loves these chews, but I think they are too thin facilitate the removal of tartar.  But, I haven't conducted a scientific study, and I could be wrong."
"The caramel-like stuff holding this bar together tastes like toffee and goes great with the flavor of the nuts.  It isn't too sticky that I'd worry about fillings being ripped out but also a ""teeth check"" in the mirror was required after eating this bar.  I was sucking little bits of the bar out of my teeth for several minutes, but I kind of expected that.<br /><br />Anyway, these are very good and should be a hit with you as long as you're cool with the sugar in these.  I've been buying more of these for my husband to take to work as mid-morning snacks.  The bit of protein is a bonus, and he felt better eating one of these Planters Roasted Triple Nut bars rather than a chocolate candy bar when he got hungry."
i love this product! very healthy - low fat & protein packed. my friends are always asking me about them & everyone's who's tried them has liked them...
"I use this as a thickener when I make marinara sauce.  Nothing but the best, its organic (full of nutrients).  Get this product you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Remember the better the ingredients, the better the sauce."
"Can't tell it is any different than normal salt, except for a slight pink tinge. But if it has all the great minerals and stuff... all the better!"
The number 6 Melitta filters are becoming more difficult to find in grocery stores. Order a 12 pack and don't worry about running out and the price is much cheaper (even with shipping) than you will find anywhere.
Wonderfully tasty coffee with each cup brewed fresh.  I like to use one bold and one medium roast  for a perfect blend for me.  I love the foam at the top. ( something the K cup brewers aren't able to achieve.)
"""Double awesome""  - that's what my 10 y.o. son said upon his first bite, straight out of the can, nothing added. Yes, it's that good. What a find!"
"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CEABE"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 5 Pound Bag</a> more than this flavor, and I suspect my pooch does too. We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank."
"My family has two cats who are just over a year old.  We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge."
I must say that Vitakraft has put life back into my dog. He is old and Vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food. Now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops.
"I love this coffee.  The flavor is great.<br />My coffee arrived quickly, and was packaged very well.<br />This flavor is hard to find in stores.  The price on Amazon is good.  I would highly recommend purchasing this coffee."
"We all have our vices, mine has always been chips.  Specifically, Bettermade BBQ chips, so as I'm trying to eat healthier I've tried to find a replacement for that craving.  I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!"
"This product is very good and super concentrated!  It has a 1 to 7 ratio, 1 part egg white powder to 7 parts water.  Most egg white powder products are 1 to 2, so I was skeptical, but I've tried it is several things now and it's very good.  The only negative thing is there are no directions on the container.  I had to look up the ration on-line; which was one of the reasons I was skeptical!"
"This new shampoo is excellent for thin hair because it creates a fullness and body to it without leaving yucky residue.  That's about it for this product.  It's not exactly subject matter for a doctoral dissertation, although maybe the history of shampoo would be."
"The flavor lasts for a good while...it doesn't stick to dental work.in the store its a little pricy, like 1.25 and up...I love this gum, its great for popping/cracking...lol"
"I am a huge fan of these. I first tried them out after seeing them at a local grocer, and quickly found that was addicted! they are seriously that yummy. My kids always beg me for some, too. Amazon doesn't have the best price, though, try a local big box store for the best price. Just be careful not to eat too many!"
perfect product for 2 boy teams to compete in fire building -- first team to  build fire and get popcorn to pop up to near full wins and then they all win as they share the popcorn.  I have been a scoutmaster for about 20 years and this is one of the best ways to ad interest in the skills that they learn.
"Bought this for a gift, so I haven't seen it fully.  I can't judge the taste.  The box is a lot more fragile then I thought it would be.  In fact, a bottom piece was broken...no time to send it back, so I just glued it. It's a very nice looking gift though."
"Vegan. Natural. Raw. Kosher. If you like Cinnabon-style cinnamon nut rolls, you'll love this one.

"I tried this on a lark.  I had tried skinny girl and as someone that counts calories, I thought it tasted so awful I would rather have a real cocktail and forego good.<br />So I was super excited when I ran across this, and tried it and found it so amazing! TASTES DELICIOUS!!!!<br />It makes your cocktail under a 100 calories and no icky chemicals that you cannot pronounce.<br />(My mom got auto immune and I stay away from artificial sweeteners!)<br />My fav was the Mango Margarita.<br />I also liked the cucumber mint one (the green drink)<br />I also made it virgin for my kids-they loved!<br />Def blend the mango!!!"
Flowers look great and very fresh considering how far they came from. They smelled great and lasted a long time. Can't complain at all.
"Fresh, easy cup of delicious coffee in one minute. Fill the water tank, push the button to heat the water, push the button to push the water through the pod and you get one or two cups of coffee with foam on top."
"Great cereal, i was at a local rite aide. some one must have made a mistake and tagged every box<br />at .99 cents. lucky me.  i wasnt about to pay 4.99 for a small box of cereal that's just crazy.<br />but the cereal rocks, awesome taste."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKAA2"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup, Rainforest Blend, 36-Count</a><br /><br />I tirelessly searched for an alternative to high priced K-Cups. Low and Behold I stumbled upon San Francisco Bay Coffee one cup for Keurig. The coffee is very flavorful the packaging uses less plastic which keeps me in good standing with my highly environmentally conscience girlfriend. I believe I ordered the coffee Sunday morning and I had it by Tuesday afternoon. What else can I say great coffee and quick shipping,what more could you want. Also saved with subscribe and save although that doesn't seem to allow you to change the flavor of your coffee from month to month. Oh well, live and learn."
"It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, but most light roasts don't.  It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better."
These are great for training because you can break them into small bits since they are so soft.  Some of my dogs can be picky but they've never turned down one of these.
Great coffee pods that go with the Senseo coffee pot.  Dark roast is best because it gives a taste just below the strength of an expresso and is not as strong as the coffee at exclusive coffee shops.  It's just right.
"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one."
"I have a beagle mix who is about 6 months old so constantly chewing everything.  Most dog treats (even the solid rawhide pieces) don't last long enough and she ends up begging for more right away or moving on to my shoes.  The miniCongo chews are larger than I expected and quite a bit heftier.  I don't think she quite knew what to do with it the first time I gave her one.  She quickly figured it out, however, and spent well over an hour working on it.  She really seems to like the flavor of the filling.  Now, when she sees me reaching for one, she starts licking her lips in anticipation.<br />I was really impressed with the quality of this product and the fact that it provides digestive support is a definite plus.  I will be buying this product again for my dog and would recommend it to anyone who has a medium to large breed of dog.  It's a bit too large for the smaller breeds."
"I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive."
"These are, the MOST delicious, dried sour cherries we've ever bought!  They are sweetened just enough, don't stick together in a lump, are just slightly juicy, have no preservatives AND taste great refrigerated!  For those who are wondering, 4# just fits in a 1-gallon zip lock bag.  On the box, it says a serving size is 1/3 cup and there are 42 servings. They were just over $27 on sale.  I will buy these again!"
"These colors are perfect ,I really like the flakes in these colors .( these colors dont seem to come in primary colors like blk. or wht. i'll have to order those colors seperately .Thanks Amazon"
"Amazon doesn't accept returns of food items, so I'm using this product as dog treats. Very expensive dog treats. Enough said. :-("
"Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year."
"My dogs have enjoyed Lean Treats since they were puppies.  They love the treats.  The treats arte healthy and, as the name implies, have little fat in them.  I highly recommend the treats for any dog.  The vendor was also very prompt in sending the item.  The price is also quite reasonable compared to purchasing them at the vet's office."
"The Red Caviar is very fresh and melts in my mouth in the way it is suposed to do.  I don't know how they can improve the packing, the can came all slime.<br /><br />It was send well packed (refrigeration) and it came on a timely manner."
This is the best crab soup from a can that I have ever tasted.  I actually use this as a base for my crab soup and relatives have told me that it is the best crab soup that they have ever eaten!
"They are amazing and addictive, Once you have one you can't stop. I ate the whole box over a weekend, the are so juicy and delicious."
"Enjoyed, I bought using a kindle special offer and really became a fan of this tea. It brews a deep rich red, the mix reminds me of the English Christmas wassail but with more smoothness which comes from vanilla I think. Very nice for a cold and tastes wonderful esp. because their ingredients are so fresh."
"I was a little hesitant about ordering such a large bag of quinoa after reading so many stories on different brands having to be rinsed so they wouldn't be bitter and to wash out debri. When I got it, I didn't think I would be able to rinse it without washing much of it down the sink because the grains are very small and they float. So I took my chances, and cooked it as is. I had never tasted quinoa before so I didn't know what to expect. I prepared it in the same way that I do rice. I use chicken broth instead of water, and add a couple of bay leaves, onion and garlic powders, a little salt, olive oil, and a little ground cumin. My husband and I both liked it very much. So I now have a subscription for delivery every other month. Since quinoa has so many health benefits and enough amino acids to provide a full protein, I also add it to the cooked food that I make for my parrots. Since I also make all of our bread, I plan to add cooked quinoa to some of my bread recipes to increase the nutritional value of my bread. At the rate we are using it, I may have to change my subscription to 25 lbs. every month.<br /><br />Roland quinoa is a very clean and quality product that I would recommend to anyone trying to provide a healthy diet for themselves and their family."
These candy packets were perfect for our halloween giveaways at work.  We had a western theme and the individual packets made it easy and fun to hand out to the kids that came in.  This was a great price for what we got.  I would order them again.
"My cats don't like it. what else can I say to reach 20 words.  It was an expensive mistake.  My older cat likes the premium edge food for older cats, but she may just be eating it because that is what she gets."
I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
"These are not only a great way to sneak a pill to your dog... but they are great to use as training treats.  I just take one pill pocket, smoosh it into a ball and pinch off little pieces to reward my dogs as I train them."
"I cannot say enough positive things about Nature's Variety cat food. My 3 year old cat was having bloody stools that had been going on for nearly six months. After a course of ruling out many things, and with no diagnosis, the next thing on our list was a bowel biopsy. We had already tried a few different foods, to no avail. Spud was healthy, lively, had a beautiful coat, and no other symptoms. Rather than putting him through a biopsy, I moved toward the idea of him having Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which I had suspected from the beginning. My veterinarian had me purchase some Innova green pea and duck food, but after a lot of deliberation, I decided to switch him to a grain-free and raw diet, and after much research, decided on Nature's Variety. We feed he and my other cat the grain-free chicken dry food, as well as chicken and lamb medallions, and I have never seen them so crazy and happy over food! He starts antagonizing me now at 4am because he wants his food. And most importantly, he has had precisely one bloody stool, near the beginning of the switch to Nature's Variety, and that's it. No more bloody stools, and we are both now very happy! The nutritive value and careful ingredient selection of Nature's Variety, that is health-focused instead of ""how can we do this the cheapest?""-focused, has been so important for my cat's health."
"First off, Tangy Orange tastes like sh imho. Tropical Fruit hands down. Lived off this stuff for a little over a year now. Tropical Fruit got me through crazy work. Canvassed door-to-door seven to eight hours a day rain or shine, excessantly drank almost every day for a while, worked out and exercised like a monster or beast, and most recently been working as a server for nonstop four to six hour shifts continually active.<br /><br />This is my recover-all cure-all push-on-all. Co-workers always ask me what the hell I'm drinking, sarcastically joke I'm drinking/taking drugs, but most directly, always tell me to slow down. Without this stuff, I wouldn't be able to be the me I really am, high-energy, high-energy spending, high energy to be calm, and high energy to be active. Friend used to tell me about this stuff way back at least 10 years ago, and now I know what he means. If you have any questions leave me a comment below. -Alvin"
"Every bit as good as what you buy in the grocery store, but only a fraction of the cost. If you can can split the order with a friend, the deal is even better. This is a lot cumin.  I use a fair amount of cumin when I cook, but I'm not sure I will be able to use this much cumin before it starts to degrade. Even if I only use half of the cumin I will have saved money."
THis is one of the better Community Coffee flavor's.  Community isn't made for all taste.  It is really popular here in S. Louisiana and we love it.  I was glad to see it on Amazon because the price locally was getting pretty high.
"At first we thought these were great because they took a while for our son to get through, but the mess that is left on his hands, face, high chair and clothes hardens and is impossible to get off without major scrubbing.<br /><br />Due to the size he also shoves the entire cracker in his mouth and at times chokes on it..<br /><br />After a few we threw the box away."
"I will say up front that this works.  If you have  a gopher in your yard, this will put an end to that.  Just know that this is the end of the gopher/human relationship here.  This is where you escalate things after all attempts for a peaceful resolution have fallen through.  After all, would you play nice with a neighbor that leaves bear traps at your front door?<br /><br />Setting these takes some work, you push the center bars down until you can ""hook"" the back of them with the hinge portion of the setting rod.  I had to look this up since the package didn't explain that well.  Then, just wander out the the most recent mound of fresh dirt in your yard and start digging.  You should find 1, or hopefully, 2 tunnels.  Place the trap so the Gopher can't go around it and try to cover the hole, don't fill the hole just cover it with a tile or something.  The box says to move the trap after a couple of days if you don't get anything.  I suggest to actually check them every couple of hours.<br /><br />I got one within about 4 after setting the trap.  Likely good that I checked often since the trap doesn't land a killing blow.  Take a close look at the working part of the trap and the tripline.  The distance on them basically tells you that this thing will hit low on the gophers body, thus the catchy name I chose for the review.  Just try to check the trap often.  I am not a fan of gophers, but I am also not a fan of making little furballs suffer.<br /><br />Cleanup is simple, worthy foes may deserve a viking funeral.  Build a small, mole sized ship and immolate it on the water.  Or, place your foe up on a pike in the yard as a warning to others.  Just make sure you get them all before this last idea, last thing you need is an angry gopher child coming back to get you.  We have seen too many revenge movies based on the villain missing a few stragglers.<br /><br />In all, this trap does exactly what you want.  Happy hunting."
These treats are great! My dogs love them and they are natural and healthy. You can't beat that. : )
"Popchips don't taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options.  They are light in taste and big on crunch.  Great alternative to potato chips.  I'm not a fan of the BBQ flavor but I do like the sea salt & vinegar, salt & pepper alot and sour cream and onion.  Like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches."
"Fallot is one of the top five usually available.  If you cannot find locally, this is the best buy on Amazon.  It is fine in flavor and properly strong.  Shipping is expensive, but stale on the store shelf is 100% waste.<br /><br />Fallot is one of the top tier because of several factors:<br /><br />It is an independent mill in Burgundy.<br /><br />They source their particular strains of Brassica seeds carefully.<br /><br />They use verjuice instead of other liquids.<br /><br />The three pack is a better deal.  But, unless you use a lot of this mustard and fairly regularly, big is false economy.  Do not get a 13.5 oz jar if it takes you six months to use.  It will go first flat and then in another six months completely dead.  So stick with 7 0z. unless you really need it.<br /><br />Dijon is time, heat and light sensitive.  If you buy the three pack, keep all in the refirgerator."
"First of all, this isn't real jerky - it is reconstituted beef sticks (similar to the products labeled as ""beef steak"" by the national jerky brands). Second of all, it is high in sugar - 7g per 1oz for Original. I was extremely disappointed with this ""jerky"" - both for its deceptive labeling and for its lackluster taste."
"Like many of you, I drank my way through a survey of gins until I found the one that suited me best. (Tanqueray, in my case.) It wasn't until last year that I realized I ought to give tonic--after all, the majority by weight of any G&T--the same respect.<br /><br />Fever Tree beats supermarket tonics for three reasons:<br /><br />1. A taste that is less sugary than Schweppes (etc.) and that foregrounds the quinine bite.<br /><br />2. A level of carbonation between seltzer (too bubbly) and Perier (too flat).<br /><br />3. Packaging that retains carbonation for at least 8 months--which is how long my last 24-pack lasted."
I think I first had the licorice menthol ones as a child.  I have loved them from the beginning.  Was so happy to find them a few years ago at the WORLD MARKET however they have now discontinued carrying them. I am now having to order them on line. Thank goodness. I know some people hate them - don't know why that is.  I can't get enough.
"Whoever said these are only for babies. I LIKE EM TOO! They're perfect for small munchies like me. Not too sweet and its whole grain. It doesn't really make me bloat like other natural food. But this, is delicious!"
"I've loved this tea eversince Starbucks sold it in select stores. Now that they've stopped I needed to find it elsewhere. Please continue to sell Tazo Lotus Green Tea, as it is hard to find, and very much appreciated. Very quick and excellent shipping.<br />Thanks again!"
"Had to use twice as much of this as Medaglia D Oro to obtain the same strength. If you like Columbian, then maybe this is for you."
"This wonderful stuff has made such a difference for both our dogs.  We have used it for about 4 years. Our younger dog frequently had runny stools - the vet often put him on powerful anti-biotics for the diahrea.  Since I started adding a tablespoon of this to all his meals, he can eat anything (including raw meat) with no loose stools, ever! (My dogs are currently eating primarily a fresh food diet that I prepare.) A vet suggested Wysong C-biotic for the pro-biotics, but I believe it also has digestive enzymes that our dog may have been missing. Our older dog had terrible allergies. She was on a variety of meds and even received regular allergy shots.  Adding this to her meals made a significant difference.  It didn't make sense to me, but her old vet (who is not very holistic) said it made perfect sense.  The immune system is based in the gut, and it is the immune system that goes haywire and creates allergies.  Getting the old dog's digestive track working better helped her immune system work more normally. (Not to say her allergies are gone, but it is as helpful as many of the other things we do for her.)  The dogs love the taste of it too!"
"Since my daughter is 14 months old she pretty much eats what I prepared for meals, however sometimes I don't think what I have made is something she should eat such as steak (too hard to chew).  So I like to have these available for a quick meal to prepare for my daughter.  She likes the taste, simple to prepare, and you have meat and vegetables all in one meal."
"They absolutely loved it, even though they were picky with it for the first 2 or 3 days. I had to stop ordering it because of price (I'm a college student) as it is a bit expensive.  I'll consider ordering it again for them when I can afford to."
"This corn pasta cooks up well, holds its shape, tastes good, and I've had no problems with it.  The order was delivered promptly."
"I just love this coffee.  It is not only decaf, but it is a stronger cup of coffee, which I love.  I would highly recommend it."
THE NAME OF THE COMPANY IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING.  THIS IS NOT A COFFEE BEAN/TEA LEAF PRODUCT.  I HAVE NOT YET OPENED THE PRODUCT.
"My dog loves these, and he is an 11 year old corgi shelti mutt.  He likes the puffed base of the ear part the best and leaves the very ear tips behind. They are usually about 5"" long by 2.5"" wide.  They don't smell bad and are small enough for him to eat as a snack in one sitting.  He could probably be done with one in 30 minutes (leaving the ear tips),<br />so this is a treat, not something that will keep him busy the whole evening."
"It's definitely nothing as delicious as rice--but... I did make a mexican dinner last night and the miracle rice absorbed the juices and meat very well, so I will be enjoying the rest of my shipment.<br /><br />The rice is a little messy--when you drain the package, the beads want to fall out with the water and when you dry it, they become rubbery and tend to roll everywhere--just a messy project.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price and the preparation if you want to give yourself some extra room for calories on another item on your menu.  They absorb any flavor you put with them so that adds a plus as well.  Just couldn't give a full 4 or 5 stars because of the difficulty to drain and dry"
"This is the first time I ordered 8 O'clock coffee. I usually drink columbian and buy my stock from Joe Traders. From taste point, 8 O'clock coffee is nowhere behind Joe Trader's coffee or for that matter any other columbian coffee. However, price is a lot cheaper compared to other brands. I got a 40Oz bag for $10 and I call that a substantial savings in a market when everything costs more. Overall, I am very satisfied and will buy again."
"I was informed by multiple Target employees (I visited 6-7 Target stores in search of these cookies) that they were unable to keep these Limited Edition Oreos in stock because they were bought in bulk by people selling them on Amazon at a huge markup (a 400% markup, to be precise).<br /><br />I realize price gouging is only illegal when it involves natural disasters and life essentials -- neither of which is the case here -- but it is always an unfair practice that makes it impossible for the average shopper to find Limited Edition and/or ""soon-to-be-discontinued"" items on the shelf, forcing us to pay ridiculous prices online (if we're inclined to be moved to such extremes).<br /><br />It seems this practice is particularly popular with the hottest toys during Christmas time (if the Amazon forums are any indication). The only way to put a stop to this practice? Speak with your dollars; don't give into the temptation; and spend your money on something else.<br /><br />It's for that reason that I have no idea how these Candy Corn Oreos taste. As much as I'd like to try them, no Oreo is worth $15 a box."
"This meal-in-a-box was alright, but not amazing. You cook some chicken, add the spices, water, and the ""noodles"" (more like rice than noodles, but still good), and let it cook. After about 7 min, you add the dehydrated broccoli (you can't even taste it), cook it for a few more minutes, add the cheese, and serve.<br /><br />Now, I am somewhat of a health nut. For those like me, be aware that the product it contains trans fats. The spices packet has partially hydrogenated oil. That's the main reason I wouldn't buy it again. The other reason I wouldn't make it again is because it just doesn't seem healthy at all. The dehydrated broccoli is so minimal...you're best off adding your own fresh stuff. The cheese sauce is thick and just can't be good for you. If I were to make it again, I'd make this skillet dinner as a side. Instead of adding the chicken into the mix, I'd just serve chicken as the main part of the meal.<br /><br />So overall, the Velveeta skillet meal was ok, but not something I'd make again. If I want a quick dinner, I make Annie's Homegrown Skillet Meals. Annie's products leave out the trans fats and the terribly artificial ingredients. I would rather make my own food in general, but at least eating Annie's doesn't make me feel as unhealthy!"
"This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works."
"We gave our cat these treats for a long time, she ate them ok..When we switched treats, she was noticeable more excited at treat time, with the other treats, PLUS her digestive system and cat box seemed & SMELLED A lot better. There is something wrong with these treats, STAY AWAY!!! do yourself & your cat a favor and buy other treats, and make sure your cat food is good quality (evo or better)"
I ordered this coffee having never tried it and I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a great aroma and a very nice taste.  I would recommend this coffee to anyone.
"A oil popping machine, this Coconut Oil,salt and real butter, you have the same kind of pop corn you get at the movies.  Actual they us coconut oil at the movie theaters. That's where the great smell and great taste comes from. Enjoy!!!!"
This is the best GF bread I have tasted. My daughter had her first PB&J in months and nearly cried. I have been eating it a slice at a time with nothing and have been enjoyed it so much. I have even had to slap the hands of non GF people in the house ( son and husband) . Amazing is all I can say. Will be on auto ship for sure!
"These cheese curls taste much better that biscuit company variety, being a much more enjoyable, cheesier experience.  They are preservative, guilt free, low in saturated fat, and a rather nice expiration period, so you don't have to worry much about gorging on them before they expire."
"For someone who is sensitive to gluten and monosodium glutamate, this is a perfect snack. I have looked high and low for something to send to school for my son that he can tolerate. All the other kids are getting chips, and now he doesn't feel like he is missing out."
"These are one of the best snacks on the planet. The only thing that even comes close is Slim Jims. I used to get two small foil packs of these out of a vending machine, and a can of Pepsi for lunch every day when I was going through post grad school, and they never got old.<br />The smoke flavor isn't too strong nor so subtle that you can't detect it. They have a perfect amount of crunch, and just the right amount of salt as well. Wash them down with a Pepsi, (or Coke if you prefer) and it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Why someone gave these a one star review due to the price is beyond me. You rate the  product here, not the price. But people also sue McDonald's for their coffee being hot, so what do you expect?<br /><br />If you've never had these give them a shot. You won't regret it."
"These were an interesting departure from the usual granola-type bars. The outer layers are crunchy, but thin enough that it's not a tooth-breaking exercise to chew. Very nice texture and taste. Not as sweet as other bars, which I found very appealing.<br /><br />My complaint is with the filling -- there's not enough of it. I could hardly taste the blueberry filling at all. What I did taste was pretty good, which makes me think that doubling the amount of filling would make this a more enjoyable snack. Granted, that would increase the calorie count as well, so it would be a mixed blessing.<br /><br />I enjoyed these enough that I'd certainly buy a box provided they were priced at about the same point as a granola bar. It's a nice change of pace."
Had order these a couple years ago.  Wonderful.  Ran out and needed more.  Doubled my order this time around.  They last forever in the refrigerator.  Excellent item to top a summer dinner salad.  Can't believe how fast I received my order!  They must have shipped it out the same day.  I would recommend everyone try the Traverse Bay Dried Cherries!
"When we adopted our dog, she had a variety of medical problems, ""intestinal turbulence"" chief among them.  She was a competitive eater, wolfing down her food in seconds, which contributed to the problem.  This toy not only engaged her mentally and physically, it forced her to eat slowly, which has helped her digestion tremendously.  She is absolutely bonkers for it.  She spins in delighted circles whenever we pull it out.  She creates obstacle courses for herself while rolling it around, and leaves pieces of kibble behind to be rediscovered later once the cube is empty.  In other words, she has added her own layers to the game.  The best part is, if we feed her in her regular bowl now, she eats much more slowly, as the cube has taught her to take her time with her food.  This is a very, very durable toy - the first food puzzle toy she hasn't broken.  The only negative is that it is very loud, so don't use it in the same room where you're trying to watch television, or have a conversation, or think. :-)  I find it extremely fun to watch our dog play with the cube for the 20-40 minutes it takes for her to empty it, so I don't mind the noise.  Highly recommend."
"I own the original and REALLY like that one, so I decided to give this a try. I don't know if I expected it to be hot, but I wasn't convinced to reorder this one. It has a hint of something I wasn't liking in my bloody mary; maybe it was the peppers? I wouldn't hesitate to reorder the original, though! Great value here, too."
"I knew the white hot chocolate by Timothy's was not going to be perfect because I have not found any k cup products to be as strong as I would like. However, because of the low price I thought I would try it anyway (it's a lot better than paying $2.00 apiece price at Dunkin Donuts). The white hot chocolate was not as strong or as sweet as I would have liked. I put a pack of sugar in it to make it sweeter. I still think it is a good value for an occassional ""non Dunkie's"" white hot chocolate. I can have 2 for a lower price and less calories than Dunkie's small size drink."
"I'm a snack fiend, and finding something I can snack on that's also healthy is a godsend. I suppose some people want dried fruit to be the consistency of beef jerky, but I think the fruit tastes better if it's not dried to the consistency of shoe leather. Apricots and prunes are my favorites. Prunes are just what you would expect them to be, sticky, so have a handkerchief or wet wipe for use afterwards. The description above says pears are included, but I think it must be a misprint. The packages say peaches, and dried peaches are really good. They have a tartness I don't normally associate with peaches. I'm not as crazy about the apples, which are limp when dried. But they still taste good, even if they feel a bit strange.<br /><br />I'm surprised more parents haven't tried these as after-school snacks for their kids. These are sweet enough for the sweet-tooth in your family."
"This chips weren't as crispy as I'd hoped.  The package and box indicate they are 'crispy', but they seemed a bit stale."
"Product is as described on the website.  If you are going to purchase this product, it helps to understand your buying profile.  The stand looks very nice and attractive when filled with product (k-cups).  However, it looks kind of silly when less than 3/4ths full.  Additionally, it's a nice way to display a variety of coffee flavored k-cups.  So if you are a person who plans on keeping the stand replenished with a variety of flavors, you will like this carousel.  If you're just buying one or two flavors, it's more cost effective to just use a bowl.  For me, it is perfect since I often have visitors and this is an attractive way to display all their coffee and tea choices."
"No complaints considering that I paid less than $0.25 a serving. Great quick snack, I keep some at the office for those busy days or when I need a snack to tide me over until dinner."
"I am totally addicted to this! i drink it every morning when i wake up and usually have one cup after dinner, . Bergamot is supposed to have properties that aid in digestion and calm your stomach, which i believe in. I have tried severl other brands but none even come close to the quality of stash."
This is an excellent quality product at a price that is much better than can be obtained at most grocery stores.  Nuff said.
3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato & Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didn't want to eat it until I tried it myself
I am absurdly addicted to peppermint Freedent gum and have a very hard time finding it in grocery stores in our area.  When my husband found it at Amazon (and cheaper than in the stores) I was really happy about it.  It has worked really well for me.
"Ruffus Teague's Bar-B-Q Sauce is by far, theeee BEST sauce I have ever tasted.<br />I like ""touch o heat"" and ""honey sweet""  equally as well.<br />I will not settle for any other sauce now that I have had a taste of Ruffus's."
"OK, I'm from Buffalo so if you're going to sell a Buffalo Wing Pretzel, it better be good.<br /><br />Let me be honest, this is no substitute for an Anchor Bar wing, but as for a Buffalo Wing Pretzel, it's not bad. The pretzel pieces are mostly smallish, crunchy bites. A few larger pieces sneak in once in a while but mostly these are smallish nuggets with a pretty tasty and spicy, Buffalo Wing-ish taste.<br /><br />They're kind of addicting if you like the taste, and I do."
Not worth the price!!! Has a very bitter taste!!!!! You have to add a ton of honey to it to make it worth a damn. Does not help coat the throat in anyway!!!!!!
"I really love this sauce.  I use it in a variety of recipes - made a pizza with swiss chard, mozzarella and Ooma's last week.  Used it for a zucchini parmesan this week.  It's versatile, fresh and tastes homemade."
"My boys have been enjoying Nordic Berries for over three years now. My 11-year-old and 7-year-old both enjoy the sweet and tart flavor of the gummy berries over the many other vitamins we're tried through the years.  They have a sweet outer coating with a soft inside and they like the tangy flavor. I'm thrilled Amazon offers them, so more parents can try these wonderful vitamin ""berries""!"
"I've been wanting to up my ginger consumption due to the alleged anti-inflammatory properties of ginger, and so have been looking for a ginger tea or beverage that's reasonably priced, easy, tasty, and not full of sugar or artificial flavor. This basically fits the bill, and if I had been able to try more than one packet of it, I might even have rated it five stars.<br /><br />The one pack I got, I drank cold, because I imagine that's how I'd normally do it. I do love ginger, and this has a very clean, fresh, and spicy ginger flavor. It's sweet, but not too sweet (and I'm very sensitive to things being too sweet!), and the sweet flavor also tastes clean and natural, without the chemicaliness that so many sweetened beverages have. The lemon flavor is subtle but definitely present, and makes it taste a little bit like iced tea.<br /><br />I'm not sure, after one packet, if I'm ready to take the plunge to buy 72 packets, but this is very good, and may be exactly the product I've been looking for."
"if you have a golden whose hair tends to smell, this product will significantly reduce the problem. When I adopted my golden, she was extremely overweight and she didn't smell that great. After a few weeks of eating this dog food which was recommended by a friend, she began to lose weight and smell better. It is now about a year and a half later and she's in great shape and smells like a dog. The product does not contain any corn."
"My son just recently started eating baby food, all made at home. I wanted to try something that was a bit more portable and didn't require refrigeration, so when we travel it's still easy to feed. These purees definitely fit the bill. They're healthy, totally portable, easy to throw in a bag, and my son loves them. We've tried two flavors now and have enjoyed both.<br /><br />My son even feeds himself, straight from the package. He's anxious to eat it as soon as he sees the green packaging! I do remove and discard the cap immediately, as it's quite small and could pose a choking hazard.<br /><br />The serving size is great and I love that they're made with organic ingredients. I'm not thrilled with the price, which is why I knocked this down to 4 stars, rather than 5. It's a great product, but super pricy for what you get.<br /><br />I would love to see more flavors that don't include fruit as a sweetener. Veggies can be fine on their own and my son loves to nibble on the veggies I've made him at home. Fruit is great, but some plain vegetable flavors would be nice too."
"This was packaged very nicely, and didn't take long to ship. The plant was very nice, and super green. The container was also super nice, great for the price."
I have enjoyed this cider.  I like it when I have come inside from feeding the birds or shoveling snow.  It warms me up.  It has a sweet but tangy taste that I like.  The 4 rating is because of the price.
"When looking at the pictures, I was deceived by them and thought the can was actually bigger. My own fault for not checking the volume. I was disappointed by the price, and felt it was overpriced. It is great coffee, but costs less than one third in Italy. Clearly we are not there, but I find it difficult to believe that importing it should raise the price by 300%"
"I have been giving my dog all his medication using Pill Pockets. He just loves them. I prefer the smell of Beef over Chicken, but he doesn't care. They definetly were cheaper through Amazom. I will buy these again."
"I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."
"We used this to bulk up an emaciated rescue dog. This has helped fill him out, build muscle and grow a gorgeous coat.<br /><br />Not a fancy food, but good enough. I have the proof in a healthy, energetic dog with an excellent digestion. Poops twice a day, right on schedule with this chow.<br /><br />We did try some of the high-end foods at first,as well as homemade, but those seemed to upset his digestion. This one really agreed with him.<br /><br />Every dog is different, though, so you have to find what works for your beast.<br /><br />Main point: if you have a dog who needs nutritional extras(more fat and protein) don't be afraid to try this one. This poor dog went from literal skin and bones to sleek and muscled in a few months."
This oil smell so good and melt very fast.  The price was great.  I love popcorn and using this oil makes it taste even better.
I ordered these flowers for my mom when she was in the hospital.  She got them within a few days.  She said they were beautiful and plentiful.
"The Altoids Wintergreen mints are my favorite flavor of all time! Everybody always compliments me on how great my breath smells (I know it's kinda weird)! Anyways, I would absolutely recommend these mints!"
"I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!"
"We have 6 dogs, all sizes, varieties & ages.  The oldest is 12 years old and the last several years, she has developed a spring/summer skin condition that causes her to itch and scratch and lose her fur.  She would lay on the floor next to us and chew and scratch to try to get some relief.  Her skin would get an oozing rash and she was miserable.  We tried different shampoos, lotions, steroid shots - anything to give her some relief.<br />My wife suggested she might have an allergy to the carbohydrates/gluten in her food that got worse in the south Texas heat.  We ordered a bag of the Blue Buffalo dry dog food and after the first feeding, she laid down next to us and did not scratch one time all evening.  Her fur has grown back and she no longer has the patches of nasty, smelly rash on her.  She now has energy to run up the stairs, run around in the yard and acts like she did as a puppy.  The change in less than a week is amazing!<br />We have ordered more Blue Buffalo for all 6 of our dogs and our cat. Their coats are shinier and their eyes sparkle more.  Thank you for making our pets healthier and happier."
"These 100 calorie Cakesters are delicious!  Both the vanilla<br />and the chocolate are great, they satisfy those little ""sweet""<br />cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes!"
"I love these carrot cakes. I order them here as well as straight from their website. It has this awesome glaze that reminds me of chocolate. It is fresh. Feel free to warm it in the oven.<br />The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of the 5 is the texture...it is very crumbly. It is a hit or miss for me to cut a slice without it falling apart. Now, this could be me not using the right utensils.<br /><br />Other than that: Taste, Freshness, Customer Service, Product Delivery - all 5 stars!"
"If you are looking for the same dressing as Wendy has look for Marzetti Simply dressed & light Raspberry Acai.  It is just as difficult to find, but the ingredients are the same as Wendy's dressing, except they had a little lemon juice.  It tastes the same and is yummy.  They only place I have found it is Mybrands.  Their shipping prices are outragious, but the bottles are pretty reasonable.  Still haven't found it in the store.  Enjoy!"
"Well, we keep trying different kinds of treats, hoping to find one our cats will eat.<br /><br />We have a 5-yr old cat who has some hip problems due to a steep fall as a kitten.<br />We thought some glucosamine/chondroitin might help him as much as it helps us.<br />We always bought glucosamine food for our older dog, who very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the product.  First off, it smells very funky, even to my nose!<br />Chicken?  What type of chicken?<br /><br />Our older cat will eat virtually anything chicken flavored, but he won't touch this one<br />at all. They look like they were cut from an extruder tube, like little dark tynenol tablets.<br />(I'll take some photos and post them later. I know lots of cats are picky about the shape of<br />their food.) I've tried breaking the pieces into smaller pieces for him - nope.<br />I even tried waiting until he was starving (like right before dinner) and he still turned his nose<br />up at them.<br /><br />I then tried leaving some out for a few days, since he likes the dry crunchy treats better<br />than moist ones. Nope. All he did then was try to bury them. Even our little cat, who loves<br />the moist treats, would not touch this one.<br />When I pick up the bag, I get a stink-eye look from the cats, and they walk away from me.<br /><br />So, back to the drawing board. Some people's cats might like them, but neither of ours would touch them.<br />Another expensive mistake. I think Hubby and I just need to create a tasty, healthy treat for cats ourselves,<br />because the mfgs are not doing such a hot job in this area.  Although, I think dogs would probably<br />love this item."
This protein bar really makes you feel full longer but the one thing about it is that it is too sweet.
"I recently did a week-long cleanse and these crackers were recommended as a snack.  I was skeptical and they are definitely on the expensive side for a case of crackers but I was pleasantly surprised to see that you get a LOT.  So it's a good thing that they taste pretty delicious.  They're nutty and a little... malty if that makes sense.  They are thin and seedy and very, very crunchy.  I thought this brand of crackers would be similar to the Doctor Kracker brand, which are VERY delicious, but probably just a bit less healthy than these.  However, these crackers are very different: thin and round and somewhat shiny in appearance, and almost more like a tortilla chip in texture.  I've tried them with hummus and guacamole, and I think they'd also go really well with salsas, cheeses, olive tapenade, and just about any dip.<br />It's a good thing I like them because I'm going to be eating them for a lonnnggg time... it's a LOT of crackers.  If you are less sure, you may want to buy a single box before committing to a case!"
"I was very excited to get this flour in the mail. The consistency is lovely. However, both my husband and I thought the coffee cake I had made with the flour had a funny aftertaste. I surely thought it couldn't be the flour. So I remade the coffeecake a few weeks later with a different flour and it was really good. I'm so sorry."
I've never been much of a fan of olive oil. I found grocery store brands tasted bitter and/or left an aftertaste. I rarely used the full amount in a recipe. Then I read what the Barefoot Contessa uses the Olio Santo brand. I decided to give it a try and what a difference. It has a very light fruity note. It makes a big difference in my recipes. It's worth the price. Love it!
"I have used them for years.  My dog can't wait to get one each morning. She does a ""Greenie Dance"".  She jumps around and wiil do about anything to get the Greenie.  This was the first time I ordered them on amazon and I'm glad I did.  I got the lowest price ever and they were delivered the fastest."
I have just started drinking this tea and I think it tastes like Lipton tea. My Aunt claims she lost 85 lbs from it. You are suppose to drink about 12 oz [1 1/2 cups] after every meal. I figured I'd give it a try? I give it 4 stars because I just started drinking it and I'm not sure of the outcome.
"This is such a good hot cocoa mix with more flavor than most because of the ""double chocolate"". I'm frustrated because I haven't been able to find it in the grocery stores any more. So I ordered a whole case from Amazon. Hooray for Amazon!"
"waiting with anticapation to get my tasty dried fruit, it arrived i opened it quickly to scarf down some tasty delicous fruit, put a handful in my mouth, man i wish i would of captured a picture of the expression on my face after chewing some, cause the taste that i was expecting compared to what i actually tasted was like the difference between night and day, i even tried to soak it in water to get rid of all the sugar, bottom line is go and buy two cans of fruit cocktail, and you'll still be money ahead, very disiponted in amazon com for selling this kind of garbage, especially after you purchase it, you cant return it if disatified,"
"As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself."
"Okay, it is nothing at all like a birthday cake, but if you like something with a little taste, that is chewy and nutritious, these salt-free rice cakes made with brown rice is a good choice.<br />I wish they wouldn't crumble quite so much, but it is worth it for these little treats."
"Finally, a superb flour for all us gluten-free folks!<br />The recipes cover everything from bread, pizza dough<br />and cookies to bread-crumb main dish options."
The taste of extra strength is better than regular 5 hour energy but I still question the ability to give ME more energy. Would recommend if you like energy products.
"The best protein I ever had, probably the only bad thing is the price. Beside that excellent source of protein.I just bought my second bag."
"The description for this product makes some rather bold claims such as normalizing your blood pressure, proving a better night's sleep, boosting heart health, and muscle strength.  When I see these sorts of claims, I get very suspicious.  I'm not a scientist, but these sorts of claims bother me when no studies are cited.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the 9.5 pH level is achieved by the addition of sodium bicarbonate, the same ingredient in many antacids.  If you really hate the taste of antacids, trying this water to get relief might be worth it.<br /><br />I have to admit that this water really does taste great.  It's difficult to describe the taste exactly, but it tastes much better than most bottled waters.<br /><br />For some odd reason, this water gave me a stomach ache, so despite the taste, I won't give it another try.<br /><br />I marginally recommend this item if you want to give it a try for relieving indigestion."
"I am a regular/returned shopper for this item.  I like the product,but was totally surprised and disappointed at the ridiculous price jump.  It completely turns me off."
"My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"I was all but ready to give up trying to keep my cotswald sheep, because they bust thru everything including my chain link fence. This charger was my last attempt before I sold them. I have bought 3 other chargers before this one, ranging from 1-5 joules. All I can say is this is the first fi shock out of the bunch, and will be the last charger I get. The sheep actually respect this charger. I have had it up and running for a little over a month with only 1 issue. I forgot to plug it in!!!! Hands down best thing out there. The only minor issue I would say is that it could have a longer cord on it. Other than that this unit is great."
"I really enjoy this coffee...the flavor is very good!! However, every bag I have used has at least one pod that is ripped. The coffee is loose in the bag and the pod is empty...it's a real mess and very annoying!<br />I think they need better quality control."
"This is a nice breakfast or in-between meal replacement bar. It is not too big, but with 10g protein, it lasts enough to get by for couple hours. It is a little bit on the sweeter side, but the taste is amazing! There are other flavors available which are also very good, but this is the tastiest of all.<br /><br />I also like the convenience of being able to order this at Amazon at a good price--I'm subscribed."
"I selected these to feed to my cats.  Because amazon didn't list the ingredients I had little to go on.  I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried ""raw"" chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of ""treats"" that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br /><br />These ""bites"" are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br /><br />The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.  They were a tad more enthusiastic although they appreciated having the biscuits broken into bits too despite their bone crunching swallowing rodents whole abilities.  They struggled with the bites just as much as the indoor kitties.<br /><br />The bites seem more suitable for a dog.  Dogs aren't known to do a lot of chewing & are not usually as fussy as a cat.  I doubt a spongy dry biscuit would matter to an animal that tends to wolf things down within a gulp or two.<br /><br />Even though this is a product I'm not likely to buy in the future, I do not feel it deserves less than 3 stars when I think of all the disgusting garbage that is on store shelves for us to buy & poison our pets with.<br /><br />Ingredients as per the box:<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkin seeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flax seeds, Montomrillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols (note: probable GMO ingredient)with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin (note: this is being promoted as a prebiotic for fiber & digestive health.  There is evidence that inulin may not be safe for the digestive system.  It's safety is questionable.  I avoid it.), Sage, Clove."
"My dog is on a raw diet, which is impractical when traveling.  I feed Stella & Chewy's freeze-dried food during trips and it works out beautifully. The patties may be re-hydrated or fed dry - my dog loves them either way.<br /><br />IMO the true measure of dog food's quality is the dog's ""output.""  I'm happy to report that whenever my dog eats this food for a few days his stools are *normal* without any dietary upset whatsoever, despite the fact there's often stress involved in travel.<br /><br />Some people feed this food as a main diet, but it can get expensive depending on the size of your dog.<br /><br />If you're dabbling in raw feeding or need a practical alternative for traveling, buy Stella & Chewy's without hesitation.  It's a great product and all of the flavors are delicious according to my dog.  :-)"
"I like that it is organic, but this stuff is SO SO sweet, it's like drinking sugar. The sweetness is overwhelming. I could hardly drink it. So as not to waste it, I mixed it with a 1/4 of concentrate and 3/4 milk. Next time I'll try the slightly sweet concentrate instead."
"This is absolutely the best dog food on the market. No doubt about it. I am one of those persons who feeds his dog only the best. I eat high quality food, and I would never do less for my dog. I feed this to my labrador, and she loves it. We have tried other high quality brands -- such as Evo. While Evo is a great food, Orijen is just better. You can tell the difference. My dog is in perfect health. She is active. She has tons of energy. And her coat and teeth are radiant. People compliment her coat all the time. She is perfect. Orijen has changed her life. I will NEVER stop using this food!<br /><br />When she was younger, I used the puppy version as well. She loves this stuff. Eats is quickly and always wants more. The only thing she likes more than Orijen is my grilled chicken breast!<br /><br />Finally, if your dog has any issues with seizures, this is probably the best food on the market for your buddy. Do research on the web. And believe me -- you'll see the difference."
"This is a healthy snack.  If you can control yourself, just a few are satisfying.  The lemon is<br />refreshing with just the right taste of sweetness.  I keep them in stock."
"Blah, no flavor. Tea made in India. What little flavor there is, is<br />fake.  very artificial. Thinking about it? Buy a box of Twinings and<br />you will thank me later."
"This is the only hot chocolate mix I will buy, but my local grocery stores rarely have it in stock.  It has a perfect degree of chocolatey-ness and is not too sweet. I haven't found any others that are even close."
Good and tasty. nothing fancy and probably not what someone with a refined tea-pallet likes but it's pretty good to me!
"Even for ""medium"" sized chews, our 2 rat terriers (8 lbs and 13 lbs) breezed through these.  They hardly spent much time at all actually chewing them.  I ordered another bag, this time trying the large ones, to see if they last a little longer. I got them hoping it would help improve their breath a little bit. There may be a small improvement, but it hasn't been that long so I'm not sure if they're doing the trick or not. We'll see."
"I will probably take this for the rest of my life.  My husband also takes it.  I also just purchased some for my sister in law for some problems she's having.  Believe the great reviews.  This stuff helps to relax your mind and body for a good night's sleep and it keeps your digestive tract regular.  If I miss a day or two, I can definitely tell the difference."
"I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again."
"Not sure how many of you have this problem, but I was frequently constipated and struggled to find a healthy way to deal with it without laxatives. My brother mentioned that flaxseed worked for him.  Spectrum Essentials Organic Ground Flaxseed has a texture similar to corn meal. My brother adds it to his oatmeal for breakfast. I have heard others make oatmeal cookies with flaxseed added. I wanted to do something a little more hardcore that would take less time and effort, allowing me to be consistant. So after hearing that apple juice, or aloe vera juice also helps with constipation, I chose to simply add 2 tablespoons to 1/2 a glass of apple juice and I drink that grainy concoction first thing in the morning, and also when I get home after work. It took some getting use to, but now I am a pro and do it religiously. Taking it makes me more regular (most times now going once a day, sometimes I miss a day but in the past I could go a week before getting relief). Try a recipe that works in your diet and schedule, but just get it in daily for results.  You have to remember to drink 8 glasses of water per day. Side effects for me were all positive, I feel fuller and don't have food cravings, so I shed about 8 pounds naturally without changing anything else. I am 5'4"" and before the flaxseed regimen I weighed 125-6 lbs, now I am down to 118 lbs. I never thought I could lose that annoying 5 pounds I had tried to lose for many years, and with flax seed it just happened and has not returned over a 6 month period and I have a 2-3 pound cushion. The product is great but the price varies. On Amazon I pay about $4 per bag, in the grocery stores I have seen it for $8.99 a bag. My brother buys 16 oz bags of Bob's Red Mill Whole Ground Flaxseed Meal at ""Big Lots"" for $2.50. So shop around. The product is a 5 star product, I give it 4 because of the price, I kicked myself when I found out my brotehr found a comparable product for $1.50 less than I could gt it for on Amazon. But I actually love it....."
"only $13.29 a case on the petco site (Oct 20, 2011) - not worth the .70 cents a can they're charging here."
"Cinnamon Oat Clusters:<br />This was yummy plain but fabulous with milk. I think I used almond milk. It is a bit on the sweet side, so I'd not want to eat it every day, but as a treat it's perfect and I enjoyed it very much. The abundance of large clusters make it easy to just eat it dry out of the bag, too.<br /><br />Vanilla Blueberry Clusters:<br />This was less exciting to me, although still okay, and it was marginally less sweet than the cinnamon one. I guess it had more of a cardboard taste. I was expecting something more fruity and there are no dried blueberries at all, just some blueberry puree mixed in."
"I ordered this for my son. He was thrilled. While I was glad he was happy, I felt stupid paying that amount to have cereal shipped. I will NOT do this again!!"
"I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor."
Vegan snack.  Peanut butter inside a pretzel.  Great snack!  Not too salty.  Crunchy.  Glad I ordered this.
"I am the unofficial M&M supplier in my office. I keep a bowl stocked for drive-by snackers. Over the years, Peanut M&Ms have proven to be the biggest draw of all. Other candy goes through a rotation but the Peanut M&Ms are a constant.<br /><br />The holiday editions of M&Ms are the best of the best, since you know that when they appear on the shelves they will be fresh and crunchy. (The ordinary bags can sit in the store for months before they're purchased.) If you've ever sampled an aging M&M next to a fresh one, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />So whenever a holiday version of M&Ms hits the market, I grab em up.<br /><br />And of course this includes heading to the local stores on the day *after* the holiday in question, since there are immediate markdowns and you can stockpile for the weeks ahead.<br /><br />Happy snacking!"
My dogs love these treats.  Super cute design and nice small size.  They smell absolutely amazing.  It's hard to believe it is a dog treat.
"My order was exactly as it should be, I got what I ordered in a short delivery time."
"I ordered then read the reviews.  When I saw a review that said the actual quantity was 5 not 75, I called to confirm.  They said it is an error in the system, but if you go down to description, it says 5....."
"I got these so I can always have some packets at work - I think I'm set for a while.  I didn't quite realize just how many of these there were... But, it's good and makes a nice quick snack at work!"
"First of all, let me be clear that I really like this product. It's yummy and the price is good. The reason for the one star rating is that I have been reordering it for quite a while. I reorder from my shopping list, so I don't read the description carefully, since I am just re-ordering exactly the same thing I've gotten before (or so I thought). This time, the bottles were half the size, but the price was the same. I looked at an old bottle (actually, can) and noted that it was 16.9 oz. This time, the three cans were each 8.5 oz! Now, the description clearly says 8.5 oz., so I can't complain about that, but it came off my shopping list, which always before sent me three 16.9 oz cans. So, bottom line is just be careful if you've ordered this in the past and be aware of what you are getting. It's still a good value (just not a killer deal, as it was before!)"
"We LOVE giving these as gifts at Christmas. We love smashing one at either Christmas or New Year's . It is a wonderful tradition and the peppermint is really good.<br /><br />However, it took TOO long to ship and almost missed Christmas to give as gifts to friends and neighbors - the product I give a 5 - the shipper I give a 2."
"These are essentially like regular, somewhat thin slices of a baguette or Italian loaf, which have been dried so they are lightly toasted and crispy.  They are not as hard or thin as melba toast or bagel chips.  They have more of a ""honeycomb"" crispiness than a ""snappy"" crispiness.  The texture is really nice.  Like any dried bread, you will probably get a few little crumbs and occasional breakage, but these generally handle very nicely and neatly.  The flavor is of a fresh, neutral but not bland bread.  These make a great base for all kinds of toppings and they work with dips too.  I haven't had any problems with them turning soggy at all even with moist toppings.  These would make great large croutons for quickly preparing something like a classic French onion soup gratin.<br /><br />They come in a package which has two stacks of slices, each wrapped with corrugated paper to help protect them from breakage and keep them fresh.  You get a nice amount per package.<br /><br />While I personally haven't had a problem with breakage in this product, Amazon's deliveries are sometimes bizzarely packaged.  Considering that these are a somewhat delicate item, you might not want to order these in combination with something like canned goods, just to be safe in the delivery packing."
Our 2 Cats enjoy breakfast with Newman's Own and somedays they seem to be smiling.  Definte good attitudes result and their fur keeps smooth.  No upset stomachs!
"Kudos for being organic, containing einkorn flour and having a nice design however... the taste isn't great. The Einkorn Flour has a slightly strong wheat flavor which may require trained taste buds."
An excellent quality tea! I very much enjoyed sipping this brew and lounging in front of the TV. I am quite impressed and will likely buy more after I finish off what I have already bought. The quantity was excellent for the price and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try some Oolong tea. I will more than likely use this seller again.
Not bad coffee for the price but for less money you can get a good Sumatra from the same supplier.
"Two years ago I developed a sudden break out of eczema on the back of one hand, something I had never experienced before. I tried every lotion I could get my hands on to help sooth it, to no avail, and I eventually ended up having to use a topical prescription steroid cream to get it to go away (not something I really was comfortable using). Then I found this product. It's fantastic, and has completely replaced the steroid cream, as well as my other regular body lotion. I use it twice a day, and it leaves my skin so soft and hydrated, it feels wonderful. Another reviewer commented on the strong scent, and while I am usually super sensitive to perfumes I find that this goes on a bit strong but quickly dissipates, leaving a soft and very pleasant scent. I love the body wash as well. Well worth the price listed here, although as someone else mentioned, it is cheaper at Walmart and you save yourself the shipping cost."
I originally found this product in a specialty shop in Monterey and am so glad to have found it here! Great fresh garlic flavor. I love it on steaks but the wife likes it on fish. Actually no fat but you'd never know it. Very versatile.
"My dogs love these treats. They're easy to break up into smaller pieces for training treats. Dogs with allergies can usually enjoy these without consequences, as there is no wheat or other allergenic filler.<br /><br />Amazon has by far the best price I've been able to find for these--especially if you are a Super Saver member."
these are the best animal crackers i've ever tasted! the chocolate simply adds to the deliciousness. they taste like mini-cookies. they are vegan and thus cruelty-free! organic and yummy. what more can be asked of an animal cracker!
"The price was excellent & I heard many good things about the Kind bars... but the mango macadamia bar didn't taste all that great. I would be willing to try other flavors, but I would not buy this flavor again."
"This product is fantastic. It truly is the prince of all spices. I've used it to zest up over 9000 recipes. I know what you're thinking, ""what, 9000? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!"" But it's really just that good. I highly recommend it."
"I haven't tried the tea yet, but my friends have (which is why I bought it in the first place) and the way the teabag opens up into a flower is simply delightful!  When my gift set arrived, it was beautifully and well packaged.  The box is pretty, the teapot is petite, and the tea smells very nice.  I am looking forward to my next ""tea party!"""
"I love the flavor of  slivers of chewy coconut, honey and almonds  it really does taste great to me.So far this is my favorite KIND"
"Usually a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products, this one does not blow my mind. The first few times I cooked it in the microwave, it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess (Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read). Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it's cool enough to eat.<br /><br />The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid. I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture, sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it.<br /><br />I prefer Bob's organic 6 grain and the 5 grain cereals over this."
"Immedieatly after i bought this i opened and drank one sachet,its stinks,its stale product,i have to keep in referigator and have it because i have purchased by paying $-12.i never recommed this product to anyone."
"I'm thirteen years old and I love these. The texture is a little awkward for me but I'm not going to mark it down for that, considering it's meant for little ones. Omnomnom."
I was buying these so I wouldn't have to stop at the store every day before work. Buying these from amazon with the Prime perk allowed me to get these for about $0.67 a can. They shipped quickly and arrived in two days. All this left me a happy camper.<br /><br />They were however a little banged up on arrival but all the cans are intact and none sustained anything more than a couple dents here and there.<br /><br />Will buy again.
Product was exactly as we expected and came exactly when they said it would.  The kids in my class love the candy!!!
These jerky packs are great.  They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies.  I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup.  I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring.  Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.  Keep up the good work Jack Link.
"If you start reading cat food labels you will discover few that have the quality of ingredients that this one does.  Well, actually you will discover some - probably in a nice pet food store - but good luck getting your cat to eat it!<br /><br />One of my cats used to be pre-diabetic, asthmatic, and overweight.  At that time his diet was exclusively Iams.  My vet, who has done much research on various foods, has a list of cat food she recommends.  Of all the expensive and exclusive brands of food, the Fancy Feast Turkey & Giblets Feast and the Gourmet Chicken Feast really made a difference, and my other more finicky eaters loved it!  The 'problem cat' is no longer asthmatic, has lost weight, and is not pre-diabetic.  Plus, everyone who sees him can't get over what a fantastic shiny coat he has.  Now I buy these two flavors exclusively.  I highly recommend this product."
"We love Happy Baby products - cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food - EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this. It really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too! It is EXTREMELY dry and thick and lumpy. I cannot believe Happy Baby manufacturers and sells this stuff, and I can't believe retailers stock it. DO NOT BUY!"
"I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.<br /><br />It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross."
Tge first bag I had was good and a nice change from chips but as I had these every day for lunch for a month I quickly tired of them. The jalepeno one is the best. They all leave a residue on your fingers.
"I tried & tried & tried to breast feed & after hiring a lactation nurse, taking drugs from here & Canada ... Pumping every 2-3 hours with what looked like a car battery. I finally read in my studies & research that women with bad thyroids sometimes can not breast feed. So there you have it. Then I turned my research to formula & this one is by far the superior formula. My baby bear lives it. He actually likes it room temp."
I have to give my cat 3 pills a day. Pill pockets are the greatest! I have to use the Salmon flavor though. The chicken just didn't go over very well & once she tried the salmon she wouldn't eat the chicken. I use pill pockets for my dogs too. It so much easier than trying to shove a pill down their throats. It's also a lot less messier than some of the food products I've tried hiding the pills in.
"I work super early in the morning and frequently had not been eating a good breakfast.  When I found these, I discovered they were awesome to grab right before I left for work so that I could eat a little later in the morning.  I know I am being a lot more healthy now by not skipping the most important meal of the day :)."
These cookies didn't disappoint.  They are delicious and go really well with a cup of tea or coffee.  They have just the right amount of sweetness...not cloying.  (I think American desserts usually go overboard on sugar).  I highly recommend them.
"These cookies have a great flavor and no aftertaste that I can detect. I do not find them gritty at all. They are quite crispy, but I like that. I think they are as good as any regular sugar cookie I have ever had, and my non-GF friends agree!"
I do not like my coffee bitter but I also don't like it to be tasteless either. I have tried so many different brands of coffee for my Keurig and this is my favorite. It's not bitter and has a nice smooth coffee flavor. Just an all around good cup of coffee.
These are too hard and brittle (almost hurt my teeth trying to bite into them). We got them for our office and everyone had the same opinion. We have a stack of these boxes lying around now since nobody wants to eat them.
"Plugra Clarified Unsalted Butter has been on my radar for the past year or so. Finally its back in supply in the 5# bucket. Ordered and received within days and already in use. I baked a loaf of bread using this product and it was remarkable. Other clarified butters that I've used in the interim have all had a good taste but simply did not stand up to Plugra. Easy to use and it doesn't require refrigeration. However, be cautioned - with this amount, unless you use it regularly, you should refrigerate. One way around this is to keep about a pound or so on the counter. That way its always softened and at the ready, then scoop out an amount as necessary. Taste is rich, buttery and remains in a softened state on the counter. It works really well with making bread dough as it provides the proper consistency when kneading.<br /><br />Upon arrival there was a problem - however Parthenon Foods contacted me first thing Monday morning and explained that they included a small gel pack to be on the safe side for long distances such as mine. Their rep was very courteous, non condescending and a real pleasure to work with. I will not hesitate to reorder."
"I love cooking with major grey chutney and a hint of ginger, but this brand has way too much ginger. The ginger makes it very bitter and overpowering."
"Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being ""basted"" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product"
"I like this tea, it tells you on the package on how to prepare it. Not a lot of flavor but hey Dr Oz recommended Oolong tea so hear I am ;) It is suppose to help your metabolism, to early to tell."
My 10 year old saint bernard is moving around like he did when he was a puppy!  I see a very notable difference in him since he started eating the Breeders choice active care foods!  I couldn't be more pleased!
These crackers are wonderful with British Cranberry Cheese. Get them while they are in stock during the fall and order enough to last. Chocolate and Art Lover
I loved this gummy. I had bout the green one ..Very tasty and delicious! I would buy it again. Thanks!
"I really like the taste of these little cookies, and this is the best flavor (IMO).  I got these when they were marked down to $12 and felt like I was paying an OK price.  They have gone back up in price, so waiting for it to come back down so that I can buy more."
"If you want great vanilla, hazelnut flavor DO NOT BUY THIS TEA. It taste good, but has such an overpowering cinamon and spicy taste that the vanilla and hazelnut is lost. It also is not good for people with acid reflux. I take prilosec everyday and usually can eat almost anything without suffering, but 3 tums later and I still hurt.<br /><br />Like I said it does taste good and I will buy yogi products in the future, but I will read the ingredients first."
"This is very bland, but useful as a base to cook with.  Other than the fact that it's gluten free, it isn't anything special.  Since the gluten free choices are limited, I will use it, but, otherwise, would pass."
"oat flour is a good source of protein and fiber. It worked fine in my homemade bread along with white and wheat flours.  it is nicely flavored and light textured. I didn't like it as much in crepes where it was the only flour used. it worked great in place of white flour for high altitude brownie mix instructions.  I like Bob's Red Mill high quality products.<br />We are on Amazon Prime, so order arrived quickly.  Amazon Prime is delightful!  I highly recommend that too."
"""Turkish Delight""  to is true it's name - delightful. This specialty candy reminds me of my childhood. If you like turkish delight this is the best !"
I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
I really enjoy this coffee - I have used a variety of the K-cups and this is one of the best.
"A co-worker shared these with me the other day and I'm on here buying them now, because I need more! They taste just like Combos to me, but they are better for you!"
"Jack Link's Beef Steak, Flavor, 1-Ounce Packages<br /><br />These are a nice snack, maybe a 6 on a 10 point scale, I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS"">Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots (120 beef sticks per bag)</a><br /><br />Gunner March, 2010"
"These are better than any low calorie chips I've ever had, and I prefer them to normal chips. They are wonderful. Oprah even loves them.  I would buy this box again, and probably will, because I LOVE that these are 100 calorie packs. The barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are AWESOME."
"Two bowls of this cereal for breakfast, and I have apparently achieved 100% of my recommended daily dietary consumption of fiber. Since I found myself spending five dollars and change for a box of this stuff at least twice a week at any supermarket in NYC, here I am on Amazon ready to order a subscription for 6 boxes for $20 with shipping. Now if they only had a variety pack..."
"Childhood nostagia all over again! I LOVE peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I don't often make them because they're rather messy. These bars solve that problem-- the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that's in the bar. The best part is that I can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up."
"The creamer itself is fine, the packaging is crap. Several of them broke open and leaked everywhere creating a huge mess (that or someone at the warehouse has a sick sense of humor). As an added bonus, this item isn't eligible for returns. Amazon refunded me the purchase price though, so kudos to their customer service."
These are great for on the go! I keep a couple in the diaper bag in case we get in a bind and need a quick snack!
Incorrect item sent to gift recipient which necessitated repackaging the item and traveling to a post office.<br />Poor customer service.
"I love this product and order it frequently.  Usually it arrives in a timely manner and in good condition.  When I opened this last shipment I found some hemp seed scattered throughout the box.  I carefully removed the first of two pouches and found a 1"" rip in the middle of the front of the bag.  Most of the product was still in the pouch and appeared fresh and undamaged so I transferred it to a container.  The other pouch was intact.  I hope this is a one-time occurrence, and I will be ordering this again when I need more.  More care needs to be taken to assure that the pouches are handled properly and that they are all in good condition when packed."
"I absolutely love these hemp seeds. They come vacuum-sealed and I just transfer them to a large freezer bag when I open them, and store them in the freezer.<br /><br />Hemp seeds are a perfect protein, supplying your body with all the essential amino acids. In just 3 tablespoons of these seeds, you're getting 11 grams of protein! They are also super high in other minerals and vitamins, as well as omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />We sprinkle these on just about anything - oatmeal, yogurt, pizza, you name it. I mix them in with all types of food for my now 15 month old son. They are SO good for babies and young children with all the omega-3 fatty acids, protein, minerals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this item and only pay $50 with free shipping - can't beat the price for such a healthy item."
"this is my favorite coffee. Full of flavor and not acidic at all, without that ""burnt"" taste I often taste in coffees. I wanted to try something new and went for another highly reviewed brand, which is not bad at all, but I am going back to Seattle's Best when I run out."
"my cats love this thing and use it a ton! however, the toy in the hole is just a crunchy ball thing not a mouse."
"This cereal tastes great! It's light, crunchy and mildly sweet. You don't get any weird after tastes that other gluten free products tend to have. It tastes like real cereal and not a fake gluten free version of cereal... if you know what I mean. It stays crunchy in all milk varieties (dairy and non-dairy). I just love it!!! I even pack in little containers and take to work to eat dry as a snack. The cereal comes in environmental friendly bags. You get 6 bags per shipment. I pour a bag into a large air tight pasta jar for easy dispensing and I put the empty bangs in the recycle bin. You really can't beat the convenience and price of Amazon's Subscribe and Save. I highly recommend this product."
I recieved 4 bags of flops but was suppose to get a free additional bag . I put in the special code .Not sure I am going to order through amazon again for candy.
I am not a big fan of most protein bars but have found several Kashi varieties that are very good.  Way too expensive on Amazon though.  Target sells these loose for a buck and a quarter.  I usually pick up a few of these and the Oatmeal Raisin rolls whenever I stop there.
"(See the image gallery for my three photos that accompany this review)<br /><br />I hadn't eaten a Chips Ahoy in a while, but was kind of looking forward to these new ""Gooey"" chocolate chip cookies. But, from the moment I opened the package I knew I was going to be disappointed! First off, the cookies were a crumbled and jumbled heap of a few cookies in overly large packaging... the same as regular Chips Ahoy packaging that would hold two or three times as many cookies. Not the most appetizing first impression. So... is this really what Nabisco wants us to see when we open the package?? a jumble of cookies in an overly large package for the few cookies you get? A total turnoff from the beginning. I didn't expect the cookie to be as big as the photo on the package, but I did expect it to at least kind of look like the photo (which looks like a standard Chips Ahoy with the goo inside). This cookie was dark and mottled and misshapen and kind a gross to look at.<br /><br />Okay, presentation stinks, but maybe the cookies are really good nonetheless? Um... no... they kind of suck. And, Gooey?? Not even close... it is a wedge of grainy and dry chocolate-like stuff in the middle. The most distinct flavor (or really after-taste)? That is an overly sugary and heavily preserved food-like substance. After one cookie, I tossed the rest out.<br /><br />Bottom line... just plain gross."
"My famiy loves these granola bars.  They do not have a bland taste, rather, they are sweet and taste of peanut butter."
"Once you add this syrup to the shaved ice, its like when you have a good snow cone and there is only a drop of flavor in the end...this is how it is from the beginning."
"I picked up a can of this soup because it sounded interesting, but I was very disappointed. The base was really bland, I was thinking it would be sweet because of the corn, but it wasn't. The chicken was okay but the carrots were mushy and the celery was cut too big and was bitter. I didn't even finish it and definitely won't be buying it again."
"Triscuits are great, and these are not only tasty, but fairly healthy.  The only ingredients are wheat, a little oil and a little salt!  Excellent.  And buying them on amazon is so much cheaper than at the store!!  :-)"
I've been trying different kinds of popcorn and this rates as one of the best out there. A must try for any popcorn lover.
"I would caution anyone ordering this to realize that the chocolate melts in warm temperatures.  Mine arrived in a chocolate coated bag.  I put it in the fridge to try to solidify it a bit, but it wasn't a big improvement.  Makes it hard to eat out of the bag.  I really didn't want a chocolate flavored cereal, so I was planning on enjoying this as an eat out of the bag snack, but the melted chocolate makes it messy.  The chunks are an okay size for that, but it would probably work better as a cereal since the chocolate melted.<br /><br />When I purchase granola, I usually look for ones with either almonds or pecans.  This has neither. The only solids listed in the ingredients are whole grain rolled oats and chocolate chunks (first 2 ingredients). The rest of the ingredients are predominately sweeteners.  A serving is 1/2 cup and that has 220 calories, 50 of which are from fat.  There are 4g of fiber, 13g of sugar, 20g of other carbohydrates, and 5g of protein.  Just because something is ""natural"" doesn't mean it is good for you."
"I bought this food hoping to add a little variety to my cat's diet.  He's been on Felidae and Evo since I took him home.  I hoped this would be a good alternative high protein brand.  I won't be coming back.  When I opened the bag I was surprised to find that while there were some full pieces of food, most of the kibble had fallen apart into a fine dust. After a few weeks of eating this half powder/half round kibble bits diet my cat began to develop acne on his chin from having to rub his little chin in the dusty bits of food.  He hated the food so much he would go pry open the door of the closet where his other foods were kept and rummage through the other bags of food.  He also appeared to have some kind of an allergic reaction to the food which manifested in vigorous licking of his front paws until they were raw.  Poor guy. I understand every cat is different, but I was extremely disappointed by this crumby (pun intended) food."
"Excellent product.  In my opinion, the best of the Senso coffee blends.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it's available."
It's instant Oatmeal. Sweet and tasty for a quick out the door breakfast.<br />In the morning at work I just mix it with 1/2 cup water from the instahot tap in a disposable coffee cup and I'm good to go.
"If you're looking for a healthy and ""heart smart"" cereal, this could be it.  As a cold cereal, the flakes are tasty and crunchy.  The blueberry/kash clusters are also nice, adding texture and flavor, although I find that they float to the bottom of my bowl midway through.  I usually eat this with just milk for breakfast or to fuel a midday jog, but I've also been known to eat it right out of the box when I'm hungry and need something healthy to eat ASAP!<br /><br />The taste is slightly sweet without going overboard and could use a few more blueberries per serving, but I add my own.  This cereal is not, unfortunately, organic, as other items in the Kashi line are.  But it's still a great selection for a quick meal any time of the day!<br /><br />As for best prices on this product, I do NOT support Wal-Mart regardless of how low their prices are.  Whole Foods tends to be the most expensive, of course, and I've seen this elsewhere for about $3.49 per box.  Because it's Kashi, it won't be cheap but it's a good addition to your diet if you can afford it."
"Awesome taste, perfect crunch; these are the best seeds I've ever had. Not to mention I love how it isn't nearly as salty as the other seeds."
"Honestly, that's what I thought throughout trying this tea.  The smell and taste is entirely of cinnamon.  I couldn't ever taste the tea- and even in my smallest cup it tasted weak and watery.<br /><br />If you want caffeinated cinnamon, go for it.<br /><br />If you want true chai... look elsewhere.<br /><br />PS.  What's with the size of the bags?  Not even 2 grams per bag.  Even for American-style tea bags, this is small."
"I love buying gummies wholesale because they are so much cheaper per pound than buying them at the candy store! I am always able to find any gummy I need from them, with good prices, and quick shipping!"
"I have been eating Erin's for Breakfast for over 2 yrs now. Very filling, taste is excellent. Good to take along when you're late for work as I usually am. A great all around breakfast. I like mine warmed up in the Microwave."
This is a box of 4 gallon jugs of Arizona Sweet Tea. It is sometimes hard to find in a store - enough said.
"This is the best marinade I have ever had.  Marinated a brisket overnight, slow cooked it for 10hrs, and it broke apart.  Best brisket I have ever had.  Would definitely recommend it."
This is a wonderful large salt crystal that really adds color and flavor to any dish you would accent with salt. It does disolve quickly so use it just before serving.
"I am not a die hard candy person, but these are great!  They do cost a bit more; but they're not that much more.  And besides, you ARE putting it in your body, so I think you're worth it.<br /><br />They are made from real fruit extracts; ironic that that is so rare.  The taste has loads of flavor.  They taste like real fruit.  Nice and tart, not like that sicky sweet that I can't identify in the artificial flavored pops.  Blueberry and cherry are my favorite, but all are excellent.  While not health food, they are a healthier version of junk food.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
"It took a while to get here, but it got here nonetheless.  This dish is actually quite spicy (and I love hot food).  It was too hot for my wife.  However, it was very tasty, and I will definitely buy it again!"
This tea is so delicious and the package of 10 is perfect for a little gift for someone.
"I was surprised to discover that I can brew 16 oz. of flavorful tea, very comparable to the Yorkshire Gold I normally brew from leaves!<br />I have even brewed a 20 oz pot when I wanted a milder tea in the evening.<br />It does not have the richness of Bewleys Clipper Gold or Twinings Irish Breakfast, but it's close.<br />The only drawback is cost, but that is compensated by convenience."
"I was hoping these would be a bit more exciting than they were. My son eats everything, but was fairly disinterested in these. I don't really blame him, I tried them myself and was underwhelmed with the flavor. Couldn't detect mango at all in the mango risotto! Organic ingredients are a huge plus though, so I'm glad they exist."
"This has been my favorite for quite a while. I usually bought 2 bottles at a time, and now I can't find it anywhere.<br />DITD (Down in the dumps!)<br /><br />Update - Jan 8, 2009<br />PLEASE BE CAREFUL - I ordered this item and they sent me the fat-free variety. If I had wanted the fat-free variety I would have ordered it.<br />Amazon made it right though. They sent me the correct item."
"This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference. Add a little honey and its delicious. Had neighbors try it and they fell in love, drank my whole stash. One of my spouse's favorites, even I enjoy it and I'm a coffee drinker!"
"This cake mix has sodium lauryl sulphate in it, one of the main ingredients that make soaps and detergents lather. Gross!"
"Once I began to eat these, it was hard to stop!  I ate them straight from the bag!  They're perfectly crunchy and tasty!  Now I need to buy more so I can try them with milk...yum!"
"My dog absolutely loves these dental chews, but I love that they're good for him and clean his teeth. I started with a sample from the vet, and ever since he's been hooked. He's only 14 weeks old, but I figure why wait on oral hygiene. As he gets permanent teeth and grows a bit more, I think I'll switch to the next size up. I like to use them as an after dinner treat, and they keep him occupied for a good while (adult dogs may get through them a little quicker). Obviously, not all dogs are going to like the same thing but Blu goes bananas for these if I just touch the bag! These are much cheaper than at the vet's office and I think a great deal when you compare to similar-types of products at big box stores, that may or may not work. I plan on keeping a steady suppy of these around the house!"
"As the previous reviewer stated, the cans do arrive dented up.<br /><br />However the shipping was timely and free, and the beans are the proper tasting Heinz Beans that I miss so much from Britain.<br /><br />They are wonderful with just buttered toast, or with the toast and a fried egg or two for breakfast. Yum!"
"Especially good in the morning with cream and a touch of sugar.  The flavor lingers on the palate very pleasantly. I have a long drive to work and take a cup of this with me to liven up the drive. So, there I am with my audio-book and coffee actually making the best of my drive.  You really need to try this coffee."
"good tea quick service for shipment, great price for the tea, will order more when needed.  nothing else to say"
"these biscuits are really tasty. low in sugar, low in salt, no wheat, no milk products with no sacrifice in flavor. i have tried the ginger and the dried fruit flavors both are really truly amazing. this is a favorite of mine."
"not quite all the products shown on the photo, but the recipients were very happy. no brand names as pictured.<br /><br />bummer: even though the card i wrote was showing that it fitted, when they received the actual paper card, the message was truncated."
"The only way to improve upon these cookies is by making and/or processing them with USDA Organic ingredients...and maybe adding nuts. Other than that, the flavor is not overly rich or sweet and the texture is just right."
"I'm a big fan of both green and mint teas, so moroccan mint (a blend of mint and green) is a natural favorite of mine.<br /><br />I've tried moroccan mint from other places, and have not been impressed. The moroccan mint from teavana was just plain gross. This though, I can say is the best tea I've ever had.<br /><br />A great price too. Something like a dollar per ounce. Tea stores usually charge $8 for every 2 ounces.<br /><br />I steeped a spoonful with about 12oz in an IngenuiTEA. Very pleased. ;)"
"This is the very best coffee ever!! Being from New Orleans and living far away, it is next to impossible to get that ""real taste of home."" I'm so excited to have a source for ""real"" coffee!!"
"These are the best pretzels on the market today. We have been acquiring them for quite some time. They are crunchy, just the right about of salt and package size. However the most important attribute is their profits are provided to a charitable causes."
That's the first thing I noticed when I received these Madagascar Vanilla Beans in the mail. I baked these Vanilla Beans in a Fluffy White Cake and boy was it good! There moist too! I can't wait to put these babies in Ice Cream! I will definitely be ordering some more soon! ^_~
"Got both the chicken and peanut butter ones. Our three month old Shi Tzu loves them. He favors the chicken over the peanut butter slightly, but won't turn either away. These are pea sized making it possible to give one after another as a training reward. A winner overall."
"I am a bariatric patient, and these are wonderful on the go snacks for me. In moderation, if course. But they taste amazing, I haven't met one person yet that doesn't like them. And the prices on Amazon are excellent, you won't find them cheaper anywhere else!"
"I bought this as a training treat for my little puppy and his siblings (whom I'm fostering) and they all love it! So for the amount of treats that you get in the bag and for the price, it's a great buy!"
"Gourmet Blend, Whole Grain Brown Rice.  Yummy!  A tummy pleaser.  My husband LOVES this rice - a little more than I do. I've made three cups at a time rather than the two-cup recipe so that my husband will have some left over for an evening treat or next day treat.  I use Tones Chicken or Beef Base along with some Orzo and Spice Classics vegetable flakes, thereby making my own Rice-A-Roni.  My cupboard is full of rice.  I also bought the 6-pack of Lundberg Wild Rice and Brown Rice Blend.  I'm not worried about expiration dates as long as the rice stays dry.  I think we will use up both boxes this year.  Good stuff."
"This product isn't that bad. So far its the only dish from this series from Hormel that I have tried and its pretty good. For my taste it is a little sweet and like another reviewer remarked there is more sauce then needed so adding more rice is not a bad idea. Maybe adding some mixed vegies would be good too. As I tried this for office use that wasn't an option for me. Still, this is not a bad product and the flavor was good and since it does not need refrigeration this is a great product for office, on the road or any other situation where a refrigerator is not an option. I can grab this product, throw it in my backpack and go on with my day.<br /><br />Portion size? Well for me its not bad. Sure, I have days where I could certainly use more but that's why packing an apple, crackers or other snack/side item is a good idea.<br /><br />[My office does have a refrigerator but I work in an office where things sometimes disappear but most of the time its full of who knows what.]"
"This sugar has replaced my ""white"" sugar. It is sticky and clogs, so I transfered a small quantity in a small container to be used and leave the big bag closed.<br />Flavor is full and rich and fair trade was a plus for my choice."
"My golden retriever, Whisper, is very prone to anxiety when I leave the house. I just fill this cube with Cheerios, or even her regular serving of her dog food, and she goes to town rolling it on the floor to get every bit of treats from the cube. We both love it!<br />Word of caution: You need to have the cube in a room where there are no places for the cube to roll into and get stuck, like under couches or chairs. I have blocked off high bottomed chairs and couches so the cube does not get rolled into and stuck. My dog rolls this all around the room. I should spray her with Endust and have her clean up her hair while she is playing. KIDDING!"
Nice change from the regular pods. The coffee smells and taste yummy. A nice treat after dinner.
This coffee has a great flavor!  I am not sure if I would say creme brulee but it is very good.  Its not overpowering or weak.  Its perfect!
"If you haven't had a Wickles you have got to try them.  My whole family goes crazy over Wickles, I ordered them through Amazon at a higher price than what I can get them for in Iuka, MS. but since I'm in Houston, TX and can't find them anywhere, I don't mind paying an extra .75 cents for a jar of Wickles.  Plus I'm a Prime Member so shipping is FREE!!  Love me some Wickles and love my Amazon!!"
"I already wrote a review for the chocolate chip ones, though I thought I was writing it for this flavor, so I will just copy and paste. THe both taste good.<br /><br />I bought these bars as a meal replacement, since I am usually hungry about 4 hours after I had lunch, or 2-3 hours after breakfast, so I have to survive before the next meal. This does the job well. I can stay without eating for another 2-3 hours. It also depends how much water you drink, sometimes all you need is water to get rid of the ""hunger"". It's the way your body tells you you need water as well.<br /><br />My stomach is somewhat sensible and doesn't like a lot of stuff, but these bars never bother me.<br /><br />I also think they are tasty, but only the chocolate ones. I tried the strawberry ones, but they are too creamy. I also liked the chocolate chip ones, they both taste similar, though the chocolate chip ones have more fiber than these ones :P"
"I've tried several different coconut waters and the ZICO tastes the best to me. Use this in my smoothies daily. I was getting this product in the smaller tetra pak, but after opening the package you couldn't shake it up without spilling it. This works much better and I've taken as long as a week to use the 33.8 size with no degradation in taste."
"This hot cocoa is delicious, low in calories, and reasonably priced. Although the label only states that it is fat-free, it is also sugar-free. It tastes as good as any hot cocoa that contains fat and sugar, yet contains far fewer calories. Try it!"
"Similar to my experience with Amy's chili, I find this soup--though quite nice on its own--is really a treat with personalized tweaks. In my case, I add a bunch of chopped, fresh mushrooms, a bit more pepper, some garlic and onion powders, and some thyme (fresh if I have it, dried if not). That makes it special for me.<br /><br />I enjoyed this so much, I used the subscribe and save to get a case delivered. This is a comforting, flavorful soup that really is so much better than other brands of Cream of Mushroom I've tried, including Campbell's.<br /><br />While I have not used it yet in casseroles (though I plan to, as I found a nice recipe for chicken, egg noodle, pea and cream of mushroom casserole), I love having this handy for those afternoons when I just want some soup and a half-sandwich for lunch at home or a simple late meal when my tummy needs comforting.<br /><br />This and Amy's cream of tomato are among my top comfort soups on a can. Mmmm.<br /><br />Mir"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V37QHI"">House Foods Ukon Energy Drink, 3.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />So taste-wise, its not amazing (I have weird tastes, though: I LOVE the taste of 5 Hour Energy), and you can definitely taste the turmeric in it. BUT, it's real use is not as an energy drink but as a hangover preventer. Take a bottle before you start drinking and your hangover will be much lessened. I've got a friend who swears by it, and it worked OK for me... but I suspect the only reason it didn't work better was because we split a bottle between like 4 people, and I drank a TON. I feel like even that small amount helped, though!"
"Warheads and Toxic waste candies are super sour! These candies are great, tastes good, gives you a good kick, and creates competition among friends and family.<br /><br />But caution:<br />It's citric acid. Any type of acid burns, the sour you taste is not really a taste... as crazy as it seems, it's really a feeling in your tongue. Yes it's a good amount of citric acid in one piece, but you're not supposed to eat multiple pieces in a short period of time. You will actually burn a layer of skin-like-material on your tongue. Too much consumption can cause the tongue to bleed. It will heal quickly, as long as you don't eat more in the process of healing.It is true your tongue will actually shed flakes like sun burn. I know it's disgusting but it's how the body heals naturally. Hope this information helped you, or any else it may concern. (Mostly your tongues)"
"My picky eater likes Supreme Supper. And she turns her nose up at most, be they pricey or cheap.<br />Amazon has good price with prompt problem free delivery.<br />Of note : it has more unattractive smell to me than most cat food. But happily ,I do not have to eat it. Cat gives a  2 paws up."
I used this truffle on mashed potatoes this holiday season. Many guests asked me why the potatoes tasted so well and different. I showed them the bottle and told them they could get the truffle oil on amazon.
"This product was shown in the ""Dashi no MSG"" category however, the ingredients on the package show MSG is the second highest ingredient - the listing needs to be corrected, some folks are highly allergic to MSG, hence the danger. I ordered it and will return it."
"So I mixed up this Mocktails Margarita, not having a clear idea of what to expect.  Once upon a time I found a faux Pina Colada mix that was delicious and sugar free and could never find it again.  This kind of disappointed me; I thought it tasted familiar, and realized that it tasted very much like lime Kool-Aid.  If you love lime Kool-Aid, that may not be a bad thing, but I was at least expecting something a bit more subtle.  At least is not kelly green.  More like an apple green.  I've taken a photo, and I'll try to post it on here.  My husband said he liked it, but I'm thinking my kids (20 and 15) don't care for it too much because I found a half-full glass of it sitting warm on the counter.  Usually, Tropical Punch flavored sugar-free Kool-Aid gets emptied in a day.  There is still a half gallon (I made up two packets) sitting in my fridge after three days.  Its okay.  Maybe it would be better with the essential Margarita additive???"
"These taste really good!<br /><br />The primary nut is almond, although there is a background of peanuts, and occasionally cashew. The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum."
"i was expecting a, packaged,  Tea Sampler package from ""k-Cup"".. not a bunch of single,random k-cups throw into an amazon box. some of the k-cups were damaged and already had holes in them. this is not what i was expecting at all."
I agonized over what to put in my five year old's lunch.  I know she will actually eat these and they have a good amount of fiber (and even protein)!
"Everyone loved the treats in this basket!! It was the perfect balance of cheese, meats, and crackers with sweets. I would recommend to anyone."
This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes!
"While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!"
"This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch."
"What can be said about a food product?<br /><br />The color of the cherries are uniform and a nice color. The taste is not too sweet and not too tart. It is really the perfect balance. I've used these by putting a handful in my morning oatmeal and also alone for a snack.<br /><br />If any one you make home ice cream this would be a great addition to vanilla ice cream. Or even added to a pie.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about this product is the internal packaging. It would be nice if the bags was resealable.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY"">Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box</a>"
"Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option."
"The root arrived fresh and in good condition (95%).  The roots were active when shredded and used in a natural fermentation process by soaking at room temperature 70 - 80 F. covered by cheesecloth for three days.  I used them with ginger,and the resultant soda-like drink was delicious, flavorful, and intensely yellow-orange.  One pound made four gallons plus, and lasted when put in with paper towel in a plastic ziploc for about a month refrigerated.  Would use again."
"I have been easily able to substitute Himalayan Salt with regular table salt for cooking, baking and flavoring my food at the table. I was on a special diet for esophagitis and starting using Himalayan Salt for its healing benefits. And because I was avoiding spicy food, it was the one ""condiment"" I could enjoy."
"I have to disagree with another reviewer; I did not find this PB gritty at all.  I always but natural PB without any added sugar and also did not find this too sweet.  It has a nice, not overpowering, taste of maple.  Great snack on rice cakes!"
"This salt is wonderful as a finishing touch to prepared food. In addition to the pleasant flavor, it adds a very satisfying crunchiness to dishes. The grains do not dissolve readily, even in soups, and that's a benefit, as it adds texture and interest.<br /><br />I find the price to be reasonable in comparison to competitor products. Though $5 a pound is a lot for salt, I expect this 5 pound bag to last a very, very long time."
"This is a six-pack of fairly tall cans of salted peanuts.  I find the level of salt on these perfect - not too much, but not too little either.  Planters also does a good job of keeping out the sins and shells.  Arrives in a shrink wrap six-pack and each can is vacum sealed."
"I have ordered this tea many times and have been happy every time. Arrives well boxed, in excellent condition and always as stated delivery. Less cost online than when it was available in my area; less cost than the actual product website. Each box is individually wrapped for freshness, then each bag is sealed in its own paper wrap. Never been disappointed in any order made for this tea and always happy with product received."
"First off, Tangy Orange tastes like sh imho. Tropical Fruit hands down. Lived off this stuff for a little over a year now. Tropical Fruit got me through crazy work. Canvassed door-to-door seven to eight hours a day rain or shine, excessantly drank almost every day for a while, worked out and exercised like a monster or beast, and most recently been working as a server for nonstop four to six hour shifts continually active.<br /><br />This is my recover-all cure-all push-on-all. Co-workers always ask me what the hell I'm drinking, sarcastically joke I'm drinking/taking drugs, but most directly, always tell me to slow down. Without this stuff, I wouldn't be able to be the me I really am, high-energy, high-energy spending, high energy to be calm, and high energy to be active. Friend used to tell me about this stuff way back at least 10 years ago, and now I know what he means. If you have any questions leave me a comment below. -Alvin"
"Both this product and Pro-Pest Clothes Moth Ready-To-Use Traps appear to be somewhat effective.  Two traps, one of each brand, were placed in two different closets (a total of four traps) over a three-month period with an insignificant  difference between the two brands in the number of moths caught, eight for Pro-Pest and seven for Safer. Given the small number of individuals trapped, I've extended the experiment for another three months with four new traps, but at this point, Safer appears to be the better buy, costing roughly half of Pro-Pest at the time of this writing.<br /><br /> The low morals of female clothes moths (they are polyandrous!) and the fact that the attractant is the female pheromone means the traps will mostly collect adult males.  So, a few clever randy males can keep the population going. Although neither product is apt to eliminate all the clothes moths in your closets, they do seem to reduce the overall number.  If you have a sufficiently large freezer, placing your woolens in them for a week, combined with the traps, can be quite helpful.<br /><br />UPDATE: After another three months, using the same protocol and a total of eight traps, Safer appears to be the better choice, both by effectiveness and price.  The total number of moths trapped by brand were:<br />Safer -- 16<br />Pro-Pest -- 10"
My vet recommended this to me for my dog that seemed to have a sensitive digestive system.  It has worked great for her.  Nice product.  My dog really enjoys eating it also.
"The Packaging: I really like the packaging. There are 6 small packs in 1 box; so its ready to take with you where ever. Each small pack has ~8 crackers in it. None were cracked in the one i received. I dont think it would be an issue anyways as they are nicely packed.<br /><br />The Texture: Lives up to its name of 'Fresh Stacks'. They are dry but not so dry that your mouth becomes parched and it becomes a chore to chew and swallow. After a little chewing it melts quite nicely in your mouth. Each cracker; you can think of as a slightly bigger square credit card in terms of the size.<br /><br />The Taste: It strikes a nice balance in terms sweetness. You definitely get a graham/cinnamon type taste; with the sweetness of honey. Works well with peanut butter as well as my personal favorite nutella.<br /><br />In case your interested here are some nutritional facts(note that this is for 1 pack,i.e, 8 crackers):<br />Calories: 250<br />Fat: 6 g<br />Total Carbs: 46g<br />Sugars: 16g"
The coffee is excellent the price great. After my K cup took a dive I gave the T-disc a try Wow. It was better than any of the K-cup brands I had. The only unfortunate draw back is you can't seem to get the T-disc in stores. Good thing Amazon has them at a good price.
"I had read the reviews, but was not ready to order (6) boxes without trying it first. I found it available at Target for $2.13 box and I just love it! I have tried other mint teas and I thought they were too weak, I couldn't taste the mint, but this tea is just right! Do try for you are in for a treat!"
"This is a great product. I am French and bought it as it is a traditional Christmas sausage, just sauteed in butter with apples...wonderful. Tasted just like the ones in France and it was a big hit with all of our American friends. Highly recommend!"
"This is one of the few ways that I can sneak vegetables into my picky toddler!  He *loves* these pouches!  If you give your child more than one pouch at a time, be sure to give her the less sweet pouch first, or she may reject the second one.<br /><br />I keep these in my diaper bag so that I always have a healthy snack on hand for my little guy!"
the scottie dogs are very good licorice. i'm glad to have purchased them.they are hard to find.they where at a resonable price.i would buy them again.
"This is a creamy textured soup with a little bite. It does contain chicken broth, for those who are vegans to be aware of.<br />It's a quick healthy snack, and I find I turn to it again and again.<br />I buy it on Amazon as its no longer available at the stores I shop in. Its been a favorite for the past two years.<br />It has a wonderful, interesting flavor, has a reasonable caloric content (1 C= 140 cal.) and needs nothing to make it more so, like many other soups which lack interest.<br />I'm about to purchase my second case."
"This is THE mmmost delicious Kind bar there is! Its like eating a candy bar, except its good for you."
I was expecting a more flavorful taste such as the hazelnut blend(which I liked very much) but this wasn't very tasty to me. Won't be ordering this again.
"My pups LOVE this food!  WELLNESS products have consistently proven to be top of the line food for dogs and cats and their Chicken Stew is no exception!<br />This is so well made and although the sauce is kinda slimy, it is a healthy slimy and one that nourishes my dearest of creatures!  Please note that this food is not meant as a dish all unto itself, but rather, it is a food topper to go with dry food nuggets.  Together the nutrition abounds!"
"Great tasting product from Smart Balance. I eat it regularly along with alomonds purchased from Amazon. This is a great source of essential fatty acids without the hydrogenated oil. Some minor stirring is required as is the case with all-natural nut butters. Fast shipping, even to an FPO/AP address. I will purchase more, I'm sure."
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, my cookies arrived in tact!  In fact, out of the 4 containers less than 6 cookies were broken.  The cookies were delightful.  So good in fact that these will be the cookie of choice for Santa this year.  So go grab a glass of milk and indulge in these cookies."
"I have used TRESemme products for quite a few years,but not these two items recently my friend received a sample in the mail and passed them on to me. I love both the shampoo and conditioner that sample was the source for this order. Thanks to my friend"
"My husband and I were looking for a good snack and these fit the bill for us. More fiber than your normal pretzel, lots of flavor and has a decent amount of protein too. These are terrific! Its been part of our diet for over a year and we have lost about 60 pounds each. We make our own hummus and eat these with it, or I eat them with a wedge of laughing cow cheese or peanut butter."
Super yummy! Really hits the spot when I want a chocolatey snack that won't break the calorie bank.
"Loved the way it was packaged, only had to make sure we had bottles of water cold, not 2 sets of containers."
"The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was a really strong minty, doggy smell. I still can't decide what it is beneath the mint, but it is potent! Whatever it is, my little Maltese had no problem with it. She quickly buried the first one in the backyard, which she only does with things she really likes. She'll recover it later, I'm sure. The next day I gave her another one which she worked on for several hours before it was gone. When she jumped in my lap later, I immediately noticed that her bad breath problem was gone...wow! And it seems to last for hours. For us this is a big plus since doggy halitosis is a big problem with her.<br /><br />Another big pro for me is that these chews contain no wheat or corn products which cause allergy problems for my dog. Treats that she actually likes that don't contain these products are hard to find.<br /><br />One other con besides the strong odor is the gassiness that occurs later. I might not have put two and two together on this had several other reviewers not mentioned it. This is not normally a problem with her, however, and since nothing else in her diet has changed, I would have to attribute it to the Zoe chews.<br /><br />Since bad breath is such a problem with our dog, I might be tempted to purchase them regularly, even if the price works out to $2 per chew (5 in a bag @ $10 per bag). I might shop around first to see if I can find a better price, though. Maybe I could make them a weekly treat instead of a daily one."
"I tried this decaf - in words it was OK, not really good.  It tastes like a very mild blend, which is probably why I can't say much for it.  <p>It froths up in the Senseo, just like any other pod, so it salvages a couple of stars, anyway."
"I don't know... maybe I got a bad batch. The pastry was sandy in texture, broken in a million pieces by the time it got here. I reconstructed one to give it a try. The filling had a strange, bitter taste; the bad aftertaste was horrible. Such a shame, because I have enjoyed other Mr. Kipling products. Try Mr. Kipling's Cherry Bakewells (yum!) or Battenbergs. I wouldn't even give these a second try."
"This marinara sauce is incredible. Every Friday, while my family is out of the house, I fill my bath tub with this, submerge myself in it, and pretend I'm a meatball. I blast classical music such as Bach and read Architecture magazines. I look forward to Fridays."
"These Pop Chips are great!  Love them, even low in WW points.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips, Original, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a>"
"After finding these at Target, I bought some for my dogs.  They absolutely love them!  At $6.79 per bag, though, they were really expensive.  I tried to find them cheaper and have succeeded.  Even though there is no 'free shipping', the price makes up for it if you buy a bunch of them.  I bought 10 bags and came out better than if I had bought them at Target."
"I was really looking forward to having a way to toss a few pouches of brine-less olives in my purse for a non sugary snack on the go.<br /><br />I am SOOO disappointed in the texture and flavor of these olives; mushy and gummy in the mouth and like gasoline on the tongue -- yuck.  I was very happy with amazon customer service, they gave me a refund.<br /><br />Maybe olives are stored in brine for a reason."
"This brew is not bitter or too strong, it makes a good cup of coffee if you like a mild taste"
"I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy.  like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt.  so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers"
"I had been making my own homemade taco seasoning, but it is time consuming.  Being health-conscious, I didn't want to purchase any more products that contained ingredients I couldn't pronounce.  I am glad I found this taco seasoning as we cook taco/burrito meat generally about once each week, if not more.  Organic is best and the taste is wonderful."
"Really enjoyed using this product. I love that it is vegan and gives a similar flavor to things as the non vegan versions. We made our Mexican fideo with it finally and we had really missed it, but no more. Good value and good flavor. Can't wait to try it in other stuff."
"This was a good sample of different types of pods, although I am not sure I can tell them apart in a blind tasting.  There are definitely differences in the brands - I do like some better than others, but overall are all pretty good."
My finicky cat who needs a pill everyday eats these babies up. Medication delivery is soo simple now!
"New puppy loves this, only treat he will pay attention to while walking and training. One note, pieces are quite large so I cut them up into smaller pieces so their recommended daily amount goes further.<br /><br />All the dogs in the dog park can't resist my pocket when I have these treats. Usually surrounded by a crowd of dogs all poking at my pocket."
fantastic!you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
"My dogs loved these treats. Do they reduce tartar over time? I have no idea. You see, my dogs loved these so much that when I was at work, they somehow got the box off the table and ate them all! Stinkers! And they are VERY picky about treats.<br /><br />The biscuits are a fairly good size, about 4 inches long and about 1 inch think, which is much thicker than standard biscuits. They are very hard and crunchy. It took several minutes for my dogs to eat the ones I gave them, and they are good size dogs and big chewers, weighing between 50-85 pounds each.<br /><br />I'll be looking for this in my local market. If they don't sell them here locally, I'll get more from Amazon. Looks like I'll have to put them WAY up the top shelf in my kitchen though!"
"I found these in Salt & Pepper flavor in huge 20 oz. bags for $2.80 at BigLots recently. They are very tasty and they have no artificial aftertaste whatsoever.  We were in the middle of one bag when we pulled out chips that seemed wet.  Turns out it was just the oil on the chips.<br />They are mighty flavorful and crunchy, but, yes, they can be greasy. Definitely a guilty pleasure to be eaten in moderation!"
I was trying to drink more green tea but found most to be rather tasteless. Then I tried the green chai tea and I love it. It has a richer taste with all the various spices it has blended with the green tea.
"This is a great product because it doesn't spike your blood sugar. It tastes closer to sugar than anything else I've ever tried. It's expensive, but just use it sparingly."
"Wanted to try this smoothie mix and am glad I did. It has great authentic banana taste and a fair amount of protein in a serving. I've had it plain-jane, added it to my regular vanilla whey protein powder with a few blueberries, and added some peanut butter powder to the banana powder and they are all good."
"First off, i would have to say that I did not find the Bacon flavor to be appealing at all.<br /><br />OK I'm kidding.  I didn't actually lick it.<br /><br />But my dog did, and she loves it.<br /><br />The basics:<br />The container is like a roll-on antiperspirant.  If you use roll-on deodorant, and buy this product, you may accidentally sport a new aroma if you are particularly groggy in the morning.<br />Its a no-calorie treat if your dog is ... uh... ""easy to see"" as they say.  My dog is a bit thick (like a barrel on stilts), so I had some high hopes for this product.<br /><br />The pros:<br />My dog loves it.<br />Its low calorie.<br />No crumbs!<br /><br />The cons:<br />You can't throw it in the laundry room as an easy way to get them to be put up.<br />I had to hold it upside down, and it would drip.<br />When my dog is aggressive she threatens to take it away from me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is one of the few products that delivers exactly what it promises.  I recommend it."
I love these and usually have one a day! They give me the POTATOE flavor and crunch without the fat and calories!
"A very tasty Chai Latte...a nice treat and diversion from the other coffee options. Not too sweet and not too bland...just right with the flavor! The latte smells incredible when it's brewing...MMmmmm....Amazon had this product for an AMAZING price! So, you can't go wrong."
"Sugar is getting older so I buy the Chicken Strips with Glucosamine. That's her reward a short trip outside in the morning :)<br /><br />Supplier is great and pricing is fair - a little under the box store price. Since we buy it on Schedule and Ship, there is not shipping usually."
These are my favorite of the Be Kind bars. They're so tasty and keep me satisfied during the late afternoon hours when I'm feeling like a snack! Definitely good and good for you!
My dog loves these - and they smell delicious.  A healthy treat I don't feel guilty giving to him.
"We received these beans within 10 days of ordering, we've never heard of them before but they are a very good tasting bean especially cooked and put on top of your lettace salad.  Will be buying them again."
"I love my AeroGarden and was thrilled with the herbs and even happier with the cherry tomatoes.  When I discovered the green bean kit, I couldn't wait to try it.  My five-year old son loves green beans, and I was looking forward to having fresh beans to give to him.  When I planted the green beans, they grew rapidly just like the other kits.  However, the plants just grew and grew.  They became overly bushy and never produced any beans.  I waited and waited for the beans to grow and then finally tossed the plants out and replanted tomatoes.  This kit was very disappointing, and I am hesitant to try it again."
"Having seen the TV adds for Blue Buffalo pet foods I was very optimistic to try this for my adult cat.  She is very finicky, preferring canned shredded meat to dry food though she will nibble on food like some major brand Cat Chow during the day.  So, I ordered a pouch of this and she just will not eat it.  If I offer it her in the morning and then fresh servings at lunch and dinner, she just will not eat it and sits by her bowl mewing and looking pathetic.  I was very disappointed."
"Another reason not to buy this (from Newdsay):<br /><br />""A Sea Cliff food company said Thursday it was recalling a snack called Veggie Booty because it had been alerted by the federal government of possible salmonella contamination.""<br /><br />Ouch! Eating this product will not only make you fat, but now it could kill you! Make your own popcorn instead."
I needed these for a project I'm working on and the misleading picture shows colorful acorn capsules. What I recieved was all blue ones! I'm upset!
"I bought this because I'm grasping at straws. I was diagnosed with CLL (leukemia) in the latter half of 2010. Everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend. This was one of them. It, along with the other homeopathic remedies has done nothing to arrest the condition. My counts continue to rise (into abnormal range). Will it work for you? Some swear by this product as helpful. My suggestion: Buy three bottles. Take the recommended dosage ""religiously"" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply. Have monthly blood tests. If you notice an improvement, bravo. If you don't, then you are only out about $20. Is your life worth that? I hope so.<br /><br />Update October 20, 2011: I finished all the product I had purchased and reordered 3 more boxes. I still have not realized any improvement, in fact, my last blood test came back the highest (worst) it has ever been, by a considerable leap. Still it is the ONLY thing I am doing with any consistency and it gives my wife a sense that I am not giving up on myself. However, personally, my results cannot testify in favor of this product."
"The greatest thing, honey you can sprinkle! Great on ice cream, buttered toast, anywhere you would use honey, with NONE of the mess!"
"This product is amazing. I initially bought the smallest canister to see how I would like it and I was immediately hooked! Not only does it give you gradual energy that is sustained throughout the day but it detoxifies your body. I remain very regular on it and see vast changes in my mood and energy level. I am unsure if it's helped my hair, skin and nails but they seem to be looking great so I would tend to think the juice is the cause.  It doesn't taste the best but can be masked with any type of juice. My boss makes an entire meal out of it but in the mornings I don't have time to chop up and blend fruits so I just mix it in some juice, chug and I'm on my way.<br /><br />This green powder is a must have!!"
"Have to say I was disappointed with this bread. Was suspicious when I saw how fine the mix was. It is usually more nutty. I grew up Ireland and watched my mother make it as a kid. The bread turned out not altogether bad but was a bit too ""sawdusty"" for my liking."
We LOVE Tinkyada pasta!  My son is allergic to wheat and egg and this was recommended to us as the best wheat free pasta.  They weren't kidding!  Both my son and I eat it and love it.  It's not mushy and has a great taste.  Even my 4 year old without any food allergies likes it!
"Used this product for a summer party.  It was great!  It didn't clump, and was easy to keep heated.  Good tasting too."
"Don't buy these from Amazon Warehouse like I did...total waste of money for these dry hunks of blandness.  I wouldn't know what they are like fresh, it wasn't sold to me that way...but at least my dog had dog chews.  Not sure why Amazon insists on selling worthless food rather than throw it away and risk ticking off customers and/or poisoning them.  I know they are closer to the expiration date buying it through the warehouse but seriously...THROW BAD FOOD AWAY AMAZON!  Sheesh."
I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
"I picked up two packs at my market based on Sunmaid and mixed fruit with peaches.<br />Of the two packs, one had a peach slice. Zero in the other. One was full of the<br />Plums. But are they plums or prunes? And overall, they are just stickey. My wife<br />loves dried fruit, so she got them in the work lunch first. She returned the bag and requested ""no more of those"". Accordingly, I threw out both packs. I called Sunmaid to comment 559 896 8000. And got a recording. Called back in the pm to ask if the consumer relations dept was working. The secretary said they are overwhelmed<br />with complaints and it may take one to two days to get call. This is the end of the second day without a call. Now, I don't care.<br />And, since i am thinking about Sunmaid, why did they make the raisen boxes smaller but keep the price the same...hmmmmm$$<br />MarshallGulch"
"This is the best stuff!!! Tastes great and is less expensive than the other brand. I really like the automatic delivery, Its always as fresh as can be."
"These do taste very good. However, they are not gingerbread men as you would expect from the picture. They are medium/large round cookies. In that respect I was disappointed because I wanted to give my kids Gingerbread Men for Christmas."
"I was a huge skeptic that this was just some scam ""natural cure that they don't want you to know about"" type thing.  But, I was desperate and so I tried it.  Here is what happened:<br /><br />I had acid reflux for two weeks straight, and it was progressively getting worse.<br /><br />After taking this for one weekend my heartburn has completely vanished.  I'm also not forced to take the honey every day, but if I ever have a flare up I just take some and 20 minutes later it is gone."
"This is the best of British tea available, I buy it all the time.  This tea is really good for those people who want a strong cup of tea that can take milk.  One teabag will make 2 cups of tea.  It's a great value."
Hard to find different teas at local stores.  Cinnamon Apple is great at anytime of the day or night.  Great taste.
"The product itself is great, with limited ingredients and grain-free. My Boston Terriers loved the taste and small bites. Unfortunately Amazon advertises it as qualifying for super free shipping but never has the product in stock, so you are forced to purchase it from a non-Amazon supplier and pay huge shipping fees."
"I agree with the other poster that this is the best crushed tomato product in a can. They use good quality tomatoes so they don't need to add anything else. Check the ingredient list. It's just tomatoes. I've only purchased this product at the grocery store, however. Pomi is equally great and supposedly better for you because it is in a box, but it is much more expensive."
"It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a ""Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends"" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box."
Comparable flavor to Starbucks and cost much less. I don't know why anyone would buy a 12 pack. All flavors are good as well.
This coffee has a strong smokey flavor.  I do not care for it.  Now I am stuck with 3 pounds of it.  I thought it would be the same as another Papua New Guinea Organic coffee I have purchased before.  I am seriously disappointed that it can't be returned.  You should be aware of this before buying.  I just didn't realize it.
"I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple ""100 calorie"" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future."
"I received this as a birthday gift and love it! The teas are so unique and it is such a nice experience to sit down, watch it bloom, and enjoy the scent, taste and look of it. Highly recommend this to any tea lover."
Bought these based on the review and the type of treat. My Peagle puppy loves these more than cheese! Perfect for training and they can be cut up easily so you don't overfeed. Great price compared to other treats of the same quality. Highly recommended.
"I had this sour cherry spread once and I went on a mission to find it in a local store.  Then I remembered to try Amazon. This is the yummiest fruit spread I ever had...then I tried the plum one...umph!  They are both fantastic. I bought the peach one too, but i haven't opened it yet.  I'm guessing it will be scrumpdiddlyumptios too!"
"You won't be able to over sleep if your dog gets hooked on these dental chews.  One is enough, but your dog will drive you crazy until you get up and offer him this special way to start his day."
"None of the BEAR NAKED GRANOLA products are organic nor do they contain any organic ingredients.  Further they DO contain genetically modified ingredients (GMOS).  These very misleading statements/descriptions by Amazon.com need to be removed immediately.  For those of us for whom eating organic food is very important because we do not want GMOs in our food, this is deceiving and potentially dangerous.  Please update the necessary listings at once and remove the erroneous information.  Thank you."
What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.
"Ingredients: salt, imitation butter flavor, anti caking agent, artificial color. There is no fats or oils.<br /><br />Popcorn is a whole grain with lots of fibre.<br /><br />The problem with popcorn not being a healthfood is fats from butter & cooking oil and the salt.<br /><br />Using this in place of salt makes one of the three problems go away (the butter fat).<br /><br />This product is in granules sized to fit in a shaker just like salt.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste as good as real butter, you knew that already.<br /><br />But it is a bottle large enough to refil many shakers, and is in my opinion better than the imitation butter oil products.<br /><br />Better to put the butter flavor in the salt, like this!"
"I tried this special coffee last month, fell in love with the low acid notes in my morning pick-me-up, and have never looked back on other brands. Hands down, this is the best of the best in our household.<br /><br />The eco-friendly packaging, compared to other K-cups, puts other manufacturers to shame. In this case, less is more. And better. And environmentally-friendly. I like that the coffee is organic, and that rain forests around the world benefit from the production of their coffee beans (fair trade, shade grown), packaged and produced. Even with my coffee, I am looking for ways to help support eco-friendly businesses and products.<br /><br />And with this order, you receive eighty k-cup pods for thirty-three dollars. It is affordable and tastes great. Recommended.<br /><br />T.B. Grant<br />9.9.12"
"I bought this oil as a part of a Christmas present for my father. I had been looking for a vinegar sampler, and came up empty. So I bought 3 vinegars and this oil from the same vendor thinking I could get a break on shipping. It wasn't to be - each of my gifts had shipping costs almost as high as the cost of the product.<br />It all worked out as my father genuinely loved the oil and the vinegars."
"I'm a muesli eater who tries a granola every once in a while to see if I've changed my mind and decided I like it any better. Like other granolas, this one did not convince me to switch. My basic gripe about granolas is that they get that crunchiness from sugars. That's true here as well, although the sugars have fancier names -- plus you have chocolate added.<br /><br />The ingredients of this product are as follows: whole grain rolled oats, semi-sweet chocolate chunks (chocolate, sugar, dextrose, cocoa butter, etc), evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, brown rice flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, molasses, vitamin E (to preserve flavor), natural flavor.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, but since I really enjoy muesli more anyway, I guess I still don't see much of a reason to switch to granola. I'm glad I tried this product, but it seemed pretty much like a typical granola to me.<br /><br />If you want a chocolaty granola, this could be a great product for you."
"Love'em,  love'em, love'em,...these crackers are indeed awesome and especially with cottage cheese & pineapple! So glad Amazon carries them cause all the major grocers in my area do not...probably because they are too expensive! It's possible they could agree to carry at the Oriental market if I asked them cause the last time I was there these were not in stock!  I didn't panic then because another grocer in my area did carry them, but now not even them!  Therefore, I will be placing an order thru Amazon....it's cheaper anyway!!"
I LOVE THESE PEARS SERVED WITH MAYONNAISE & GRATED SHARP CHEESE - CHILL THEN EAT...PEARS ARE LOW IN SUGAR ANYWAY BUT THESE HAVE SPLENDA IN THE SYRUP / JUICE SO EXTRA GOOD FOR DIABETICS. GOOD PRICE TOO.
"I was recently diagnosed with hypoglycemia and was instructed to eat little protein snacks every 2-3 hours.  These little packs are PERFECT for keeping in my purse, backpack, desk drawer for a quick snack when my home fridge is not accessible.  These have saved me on my weekend treks around town.<br /><br />These have no added sugar or salt, which is perfect for me as well.  Some who've been raised on traditional peanutbutters (Jif, Skippy) will probably find this ""difficult to swallow"" at first (my Dad said he thought it tastes rancid!).  But for those of us who are accustomed to no added sugars and salts in our nut butters, these have good flavor.<br /><br />I would prefer to have RAW almond butter, which I typically purchase in large jars, but Justin's makes only roasted nut butters (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).<br /><br />If you're looking for economy, buy the jars of Justin's nut butters.  If you're looking for convenience and quick snacks, these packets are the way to go.  And the price offered on Amazon is MUCH CHEAPER than the local stores."
"While I am no fan of coffee, other members in my household love it.  This got rave reviews.<br /><br />This looks like it comes in a tea bag.  It's easy to make; you just brew it for a few minutes and wring it out.  You can make it the way you make tea by applying the bag concept.  This was a big hit with the coffee hounds.<br /><br />."
A fantastic blend. Also tastes quite good brewed cold! For this reason I take them on backpacking trips with me: it lets me have something quite tasty in the morning before I'm awake enough to get water on the boil.
"I ordered this Chai because of the reviews I read expecting a yummy taste comparable to chai products purchased in Starbucks or gourmet drink establishments.  I followed the instructions using 3 heaping teaspoons, and mixed it with hot milk first, and then experimented by mixing it next in hot water, and again in half and half combination of hot water and hot milk.  I even have mixed it with hot water and used it with a chai tea bag for a stronger taste.  I am not getting the spicey taste I desired but the product is good.  It's just not AS good.  I am not certain if I will reorder.  What I like about the product -- you can use it just with hot water and it is good."
"We love this low-fat, all-natural cracker.  It tastes great and the seeds on top are a tasty bonus.  Just wish Amazon still carried them so I could reorder."
This item contains Genetically Modified Ingredients and therefore I will no longer be purchasing from Kellogg's until they change to GMO free items. For more information on GMO's go to [...]
I was pleased with the assortment of coffee but received 2 hot cocoa and 5 cider cups which I did not want. Would have left 5 stars if there were 24 COFFEE cups as stated.
"I have baby-fine hair, but tons of it.  I usually purchase salon shampoos which range from $15 - $20 per bottle.  I am always looking for a shampoo that will provide me with softness and manageability without the need for a daily conditioner since conditioner tends to weigh my hair down and make it appear flat.  When I first opened the bottle, I was pleased with the pleasant scent.  It is aromatic, but not overwhelming.  With the first use, my hair, which is currently dry from daily swimming, was softer than it had been with a much more expensive salon brand.  I was worried that the softness might lead to a flatter appearance.  To my surprise, my hair was manageable and styled very nicely with plenty of lift at the root.  I have now been using the shampoo daily for almost a week and am very pleased with the softness of my hair while still getting the volume I am looking for.  I have truly been getting better results than I had been getting from a salon brand costing over three times as much.  I recommend you try this product!"
This is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea! I add lemon juice and stevia.
"since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet. When we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand  we were there at least 1 time every six weeks. they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape. NO more food alergies. No more vomiting, Made with bells & evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods & other organic food sellers. If its good enough for you, it's good enough for them. All Mr Newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization. Give this food 12 weeks see the improvememnt yourself."
"I have a 5 month old, a preschooler, and a teenager so I'm forever tired!  I hated the taste, but it did what I needed it to do. I got energy enough to keep going, but not so much that I was jittery. When it wore off I also didn't crash out like other products powered with caffeine. I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360."
"We have been using this all summer as a boost in the middle of long day hikes.  It gives you the POP you need and believe it or not it tastes good.  Not only is it re energizing it is also a treat,"
Good to purchase in a larger quantity! Ease for keeping supplies in stock! Easy to obtain from Amazon without a third party involved.  Got to use my free shipping - yea.
"I love nuts of all kinds, and eat some almonds and walnuts every day. I've tried all the brands of almonds--salted, unsalted, raw, dry-roasted, spiced, cocoa covered, you name it. These are by far the tastiest of all brands and types I've tried. Great texture, a hint of salt...just right. The only problem with these is that they're so delicious its hard to stop eating them. Plus, Amazon beats the store price. Love them..."
Great price for decaf Earl Grey that sometimes is hard to find on shelves of grocery store. Stash tea is a brand that you can count on too.
"If you're looking for something to serve at your next afternoon tea, you've just found it! These cookies are premium key-lime pie in finger-food form. The texture is light and slightly crunchy, with a moderately sweet and somewhat tart key-lime flavor. They're truly sinful and addictive. For this reason, buy these only if you intend to share, lest you'll find yourself devouring the entire box in one place."
My Dog loves these and has not had any problem with them.  He only gets one at bed time as his bed time treat.  Don't over feed your dog with these treats.
"These were a bit delicious but I immediately grew a bit tired of them. There's way too much salt in these and I'm the kind of person who likes my cashews salty. The peppery taste was a bit of a nice compliment and when tasted in with the cashews alluded to a bit of a lime-like flavor, but I found it hard to keep myself from thinking  bout how much salt was in these. It was enough to burn my tongue and lips and cause me to stop eating them, even though they tasted good."
"I love these muffins and can't get them anyplace near me.  This subscription is more convenient and even cheaper than I got them at Walmart!  As a T2 diabetic, these are a yummy breakfast choice that doesn't shoot my blood sugar through the roof."
I have at least 4 dozen different k-cups at my house right now because we love to experiment with different flavors.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.
The dasuquin soft chews are the only glucosamine/chondroitin tabs that my dog likes and they seem to be helping. The price was about half of what I paid through the vet.
"I love pumpkin seeds and they have good nutritional value, but most commercial seeds are covered with more that a day's supply of salt.  I always eat them shells and all so the salt is...BAD.  I've been looking for unsalted pumpkin seeds in stores for years with no luck, so I decided to try these raw seeds.  They arrived very quickly.  The seeds are huge compared to other pumpkin seeds and they taste like they need a little salt (LOL)  Actually, they taste like I just pulled them out of a jack-o-lantern and baked them in the oven without salt...A nostalgic taste.  I like them and feel good about eating them without salt.  Getting my daily supply of fiber.  I will buy them again.  YUM."
"After not having a s'more in 16 years, I was beyond excited to find marshmallows that I can eat!  (I don't eat gelatin).  I waited in anticipation to get these and they JUST arrived.  Before I even opened the package, the disappointment began.  The marshmallows came in a bubble envelope!  Not a box, an envelope.  So I was prepared for them to be a bit squished.  Then, upon opening the envelope, I discovered that they weren't as squished as they had appeared from the outside.  The flatness of the package was mainly due to these marshmallows being super tiny!  I'm going to need at least 6 to make a s'more.<br /><br />So even after all of that, I'll still give them a 4 star rating because they really do have the consistency of a ""real"" marshmallow.  My husband couldn't tell the difference.  The price is a bit ridiculous as well, but I decided to go for it since it had been so long since my last marshmallow experience.  I'll update later after my s'more attempt.<br /><br />UPDATE:  They roast just like regular marshmallows.  Awesome.  We used 3-4 marshmallows per s'more."
"I Love this Lipton Iced Tea product, and recently bought two of them. It's Tasty and thirst-quenching.<br /><br />However, it's a bit too expensive now since I bought it last (300% increase in price), and I'm probably not going to purchase again at it's current sale price.<br /><br />I WILL purchase again when the price goes down."
"The tea tastes very good - it has a nice flavor and is refreshing.  It's a bit sweeter than I would like, but people who like sweet tea will like this tea. It has a nice fruity flavor.  I did not realize it would be pulpy - didn't read the label carefully enough - and the first mouthful was quite a shock!  After I realized that the pulp was SUPPOSED to be there (as opposed to indicating spoilage) I really enjoyed it."
An organic product I keep on hand for my grandchildren.  Was delivered on time from a reliable seller and I would reccommend to anyone who was looking for a healthy snack for kids that is easily portable to consider this Peter Rabbit squeezy fruit.
"We fed our baby this formula for several months - until we realized that we were spending nearly $150/month on formula alone.<br /><br />We consulted our pediatrician as well as a pediatric nutritionist, and both told us that there is very little difference in the formulas from major brands because they are heavily regulated.<br /><br />We then went to Costco where we were able to find the Kirkland brand of formula for $60.00 for six 25.7 oz cans.  Read the label - it has all the brain boosting stuff (dha, etc.) as well as nearly identical vitamins, minerals, iron, etc.  If you don't want the Kirkland brand, Costco also sells other major brands for similar prices.<br /><br />If for some reason you really want to pay more to get the Nestle brand, note as well that this 6-pack is at almost no financial advantage to buying a single can - the only benefit is that you get all 6 at once.<br /><br />By the way, we're big fans of Amazon.com in general - just not on this product."
"Sent to us as a gift from our San Diego son, It disappeared in two weeks.<br />Frantically searched for it on Google, as it has become a near daily staple<br />for lunch & snacks. Found it via Amazon.  Just enough of a different flavor,<br />to diferenciate it from peanut butter,& mildly crunchy to keep it from being bland.  A Great product, and just wish it was here on the<br />grocery shelves in Tidewater Virginia!"
"After searching for the right dog food, I think I have finally found it.  The standard over processed stuff you find in the stores, even the higher end ""natural"" brands don't even come close to this.  This food is nothing but the real deal.  When you put the water into it, it actually smells like the items in it.  There is no need for extra oils etc.  I have four dogs who start barking as soon as the water goes into it and it soaks.  They can't wait to eat now!  I am going to try all the various flavors.  It took about three weeks for their systems to adjust but now they seem totally fine and have no issues.  If you get worried about their stools, just wait.  You need to introduce this food gradually and you will be rewarded with dogs that seem to have a lot more energy."
"These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health."
"After hearing so much about this produced-in-America canned tuna which was placed high in one of the tuna tasting tests, I wanted to try it before I would commit to buying 6 of it from Amazon.  Therefore I spent $ 4.99 plus tax for one can of this tuna from the local Whole Foods.  I also saw two different types of Wild Planet canned tuna there but passed both because they were all processed and packed in Vietnam.  Well, this can of American Tuna was 6 oz. comparing with most other canned tuna which was usually 3.75 oz.  Therefore, it was enough for both my wife and me after she turned it into a tuna salad for us to make sandwiches.  Its texture was just a little bit too tough for my taste and it tasted just like tuna.  Now, it did taste closer to chicken than other tunas I had tried.  I am just not sure it is really worth $ 5 a can.  I guess I have to continue my quest for the ""perfect gourmet tuna""."
"I saw an advertisement for this new line of soups and was really interested.  I often have soup for lunch at work and thought this would be a nice treat from my usual Campbell's Select Harvest or Thick & Chunky soups.  Considering how much more it cost than those soups, I had high expectations.<br /><br />Before I get to the taste, I want to talk about the packaging.  The usual Campbell's soup comes in a metal can that is recyclable in almost every community recycling program I know of.  This soup package will require more effort from me to recycle.  Instead of a can, it is packaged in a #5PP plastic container with an unlabeled plastic lid.  My community recycling does not accept #5PP so I will have to save it in a bag with my yogurt containers until I have enough to bring them to a local grocery store that collects it.  But even that will take work because the interior lid is an aluminum poptop and there is an aluminum lid on the plastic container.  So I will have to find a way to get the aluminum ring off before I can put it in with the plastic.  I wish Campbell's had stayed with the traditional can packaging.<br /><br />The extra work for recycling and the extra cost might be worth it if the soup were really fantastic.  I didn't think it was.<br /><br />On the plus side, the chunks of beef and potatoes are much larger than even in the thick & chunky line.  And it has portobello mushrooms.  But the carrot pieces were small and the ratio of broth/sauce (it's thick like stew sauce) to chunks of meat/vegetables was thinner than I expected for the price.  I also didn't care for the taste of the sauce.  I couldn't identify why I didn't like it but it didn't taste good to me.  This was a lunchtime ""splurge"" that wasn't worth the price.  I'm not sure I'd want it again even if the price were much lower.<br /><br />I won't buy this flavor again and, unless there is a coupon giving significant savings, I don't expect to try any of the other flavors."
"I must admit to being a bit of a tea connoisseur.  I tend to like fragrant teas but I like a base of robustness to stand up to milk.  I have drunk the Yorkshire Gold tea in bags at the office, and I thought I'd try this as a base for mixing with my other teas.  I have to say that it is not as smooth and tasty as the Taylors of Harrogate Kwazulu, which Amazon also carries, but it certainly does the job of an above average black breakfast tea.  It's also fine alone but would do best in the English style cup with milk."
"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better."
"I purchased this because I love hazelnut flavored coffee and this is pretty good if you like it with your hazelnut Coffee Mate, not a strong coffee, but reasonably good."
"Wow! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OO5K3O"">International Coffee Candy, Sugar Free By Sweet N Low 1 pounds Kosher - Circle U -Dairy</a>!  What a  taste explosion!<br /><br />These are adult flavors for grown up tastes -- Irish Cream, French Mocha, Amaretto, and Hazelnut.  Each piece of candy has only 6 (six!) calories.  Ten pieces equal 1 fruit exchange.  (Excessive consumption may have a mild laxative effect.)<br /><br />I love this candy!"
"The best way I can describe it is that it's like the popcorn you get at a fair (you know they kind that used to cost $1 and came in a tall paper bag). This is exactly what I was looking for. Yes, it's a little salty, but isn't that what you expect when you eat popcorn? This is the only kind that I don't have to add salt to."
"This is a classic product to me. The flavor is like a Mary Jane candy, only it's low sugar, less chewy, and has a touch of ginger bite. I love ginger and peanut together in asian food, and it works very well here. They should just call it peanut ginger, as it has bits of peanut in it, no PB texture. They're too pure and healthy to be considered candy. I pop them to soothe my stomach, to help digest a big meal, or to curb hunger-- as it's all real food. It's a talented little product. If they get warm in your pocket they get delectably soft and nearly melt in your mouth. This is candy for grown-ups. I think they should be a staple in all stores, right next to the life savers. Maybe if they get more known, they'll get cheaper!"
I have used Tetley since 1954.<br />The Best Thirst Quencher and it<br />has a grest flavor and it is<br />decaffinated.
"I really love this liquid stevia.  It is sweet, not bitter and has absolutely no after-taste.  Exactly what you want in stevia.  I've been using stevia as a sweetener in my drinks and cooking for the past few years now.  I couldn't dream of going back to sugar at this point.  I've tried a number of different brands and this one is one of my top choices hands down.  I also like to keep a powder around for cooking purposes.  Tried many powder brands as well, in terms of taste and price, this brand is the best I've found; <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ"">100 Grams (3.5 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  Come to my home and you'll find both products in my cupboard.  Highly Recommended!"
"Because of high-blood pressure, I can't drink caffeinated tea and I love Lady Grey, so I was thrilled to find it at a reasonable price in the decaf version. Ordered a batch--some for home and some for the office--and am very happy with it. Also arrived in a timely fashion. Thank you, Amazon."
"I have been sampling different soy sauces for a year or so but when I found this one...my search was over! This really is the best I've ever tried. It's more mellow and slightly lighter color. Also, the little bottles are so cute; the labels come off easily so they can be used for a variety of other liquids. My sister ran off with one and is using it for cream. Also, under the pour spout is a metal screw top that be reinserted to protect the contents and the pour spout goes right on top of it. I'm hoping I can find it in a larger bottle now that I have a lot of little bottles! Try it....you'll love it too!"
"Awesome little box of candy, my mom loved it so much she showed it off to EVERYONE! It only has 1 of each candy, but the wax lips especially were a hit! I recommend this product, but I would of liked more of the candy."
"For those who drink tea daily, I believe it's always better to buy in bulk.  Each of the 6 packs is individually wrapped in cellophane, so they aren't being effected by humidity (or lack of it) while you store it."
"I love this coconut water -- it's naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water (but not too much). My only ""complaint"" is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $22-23 on Amazon a few months ago, signing up for the regular delivery. Now, it is listed as ""not available"" for the regular delivery, but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $38 (also a 12-pack, same brand, same size per can). It's a bit unfair to lure in innocent people and then as soon as you get addicted to this fantastic coconut water (and I count myself there!) you suffer some serious sticker shock."
"Ok it makes a Great Cup o' Chocolate! But I really use it in my baking of Brownier, Cookies, etc. Such a good addition to any scratch baking project."
"It is really neat to see the various candies that get put into these sets.  If you are expecting company, get one of these out - it is a lot of fun."
"I wish I could comment on how the candy tasted, but I never received the order. I was very disappointed, because it was Christmas present and if I had known,I would have ordered from a more reliable source. I ordered on December 9th and as of Dec 21st, they are a no-show. I just cancelled the order and will never order from this seller again."
I use this product on my lemon (or orange) tree I grew from seed in a clay pot in my 11th floor apartment..  It is flourishing and I give this product part of the credit.
"Perfect amount! Delish! No more feeling deprived. My favorite was the coconut but the peanut butter was classic, too.<br />Good deal."
"as usual, i'm very pleased with this product and the service of this seller.  although rawhide can, on occasion, cause trouble, it is still just about the safest thing for my chewers to chew.  these ears do not seem to splinter and the dogs (little ones) chew them into a mush.  that is a good thing."
"The vanilla beans arrived very quickly.  They are all soft, moist, and pliable.  Their fragrance is wonderful.  This was the cheapest way to buy them."
Kraft seems to think they are packaging French's yellow mustard in their new plastic squeeze bottles. The hole in the cap is far too big and the delicate dijon comes out in toothpaste-sized gobs. A little finesse if you please!
"I just re-ordered this decaf coffee.  We have tried several decaf varieties looking for that perfect cup.  The Donut House is our reigning favorite.  We had been drinking Donut SHOP decaf and just tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend decaf.  While both of these coffees are pleasant, neither compares to the Donut House in aroma or flavor.  This coffee is full bodied in taste and very smooth.  We brew it on the 8oz setting and think that is perfect, although we make the next size larger for my mother who likes her's a bit weaker.  We'll probably keep looking for the perfect decaf; this one is excellent."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Keurig Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />WE LOVE THE BREAKFAST BLEND- WE'VE TRIED MOST OF THEM,<br />THIS ONE IS IT FOR US."
"I love this coffee. I started buying it in the grocery store, but this is a lot cheaper at Amazon. Rich, flavorful, and smells just like I ground the beans myself. Going to re-order right now."
"This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more. But if I don't ever find anything else, this stuff is pretty good."
Try to purchase these in the store and you'll see what an incredible value these figs are. But even more they are absolutely delicious.
I order my malt vinegar 4 bottles at a time from Amazon.com.  My Irish friend who lived in London and thrives on Fish 'N Chips was pleasantly surprised to get her real malt vinegar as a gift.
